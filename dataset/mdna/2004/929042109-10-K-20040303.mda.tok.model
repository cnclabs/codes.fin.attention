competition the company s business segments office  retail  merchandise mart properties  temperature controlled logistics  and other operate in highly competitive environments 
the company has a large concentration of properties in the new york city metropolitan area and in the washington  dc and northern virginia area 
the company competes with a large number of real estate property owners and developers 
principal factors of competition are rent charged  attractiveness of location  the quality of the property and breadth and quality of services provided 
the company s success depends upon  among other factors  trends of the national and local economies  financial condition and operating results of current and prospective tenants and customers  availability and cost of capital  construction and renovation costs  taxes  governmental regulations  legislation and population trends 
tenants which accounted for over of revenues in  the company had separate leases with the us government  the rent from which accounted for of the company s total revenues 
the loss of this tenant would have a material adverse effect on the company s finances as a whole 
environmental regulations the company s operations and properties are subject to various federal  state and local laws and regulations concerning the protection of the environment including air and water quality  hazardous or toxic substances and health and safety 
under certain of these environmental laws a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be required to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances released at a property 
the owner or operator may also be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage or personal injuries and for investigation and clean up costs incurred by those parties because of the contamination 
these laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of the release of the substances or caused the release 
the presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may impair the company s ability to sell or lease real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral 
other laws and regulations govern indoor and outdoor air quality including those that can require the abatement or removal of asbestos containing materials in the event of damage  demolition  renovation or remodeling and also govern emissions of and exposure to asbestos fibers in the air 
the maintenance and removal of lead paint and certain electrical equipment containing polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs and underground storage tanks are also regulated by federal and state laws 
the company could incur fines for environmental compliance and be held liable for the costs of remedial action with respect to the foregoing regulated substances or tanks or related claims arising out of environmental contamination or exposure at or from the company s properties 
each of the company s properties has been subjected to varying degrees of environmental assessment at various times 
the environmental assessments did not reveal any environmental condition material to the company s business 
however  identification of new compliance concerns or undiscovered areas of contamination  changes in the extent or known scope of contamination  discovery of additional sites  human exposure to the contamination or changes in cleanup or compliance requirements could result in significant costs to the company 
certain activities acquisitions and investments are not required to be based on specific allocation by type of property 
the company has historically held its properties for long term investment  however  it is possible that properties in the portfolio may be sold in whole or in part  as circumstances warrant  from time to time 
further  the company has not adopted a policy that limits the amount or percentage of assets which would be invested in a specific property 
while the company may seek the vote of its shareholders in connection with any particular material transaction  generally the company s activities are reviewed and may be modified from time to time by its board of trustees without the vote of shareholders 
employees as of december   the company had approximately  employees consisting of  in the office properties segment  in the retail properties segment  in the merchandise mart properties segment  at the hotel pennsylvania and corporate staff

insurance the company carries comprehensive liability and all risk property insurance i fire  ii flood  iii extended coverage  iv acts of terrorism as defined in the terrorism risk insurance act of which expires in with a possible extension through and v rental loss insurance with respect to its assets 
below is a summary of the all risk property insurance and terrorism risk insurance for each of the company s business segments coverage per occurrence all risk sub limits for acts of terrorism new york office cescr office retail merchandise mart temperature controlled logistics limited as to terrorism insurance by the sub limit shown in the adjacent column 
in addition to the coverage above  the company carries lesser amounts of coverage for terrorist acts not covered by the terrorism risk insurance act of the company s debt instruments  consisting of mortgage loans secured by its properties which are generally non recourse to the company  its senior unsecured notes due and and its revolving credit agreement  contain customary covenants requiring the company to maintain insurance 
although the company believes that it has adequate insurance coverage under these agreements  the company may not be able to obtain an equivalent amount of coverage at reasonable costs in the future 
further  if lenders insist on greater coverage than the company is able to obtain  it could adversely affect the company s ability to finance and or refinance its properties and expand its portfolio 
segment data the company operates in four business segments office properties  retail properties  merchandise mart properties and temperature controlled logistics

certain factors that may adversely affect our business and operations set forth below are certain factors that may adversely affect our business and operations 
real estate investments value and income fluctuate due to various factors 
the value of real estate fluctuates depending on conditions in the general economy and the real estate business 
these conditions may also limit our revenues and available cash 
the factors that affect the value of the our real estate include  among other things  national  regional and local economic conditions  consequences of any armed conflict involving  or terrorist attack against  the united states  our ability to secure adequate insurance  local conditions such as an oversupply of space or a reduction in demand for real estate in the area  competition from other available space  whether tenants consider a property attractive  the financial condition of our tenants  including the extent of tenant bankruptcies or defaults  whether we are able to pass some or all of any increased operating costs through to tenants  how well we manage our properties  fluctuations in interest rates  changes in real estate taxes and other expenses  changes in market rental rates  the timing and costs associated with property improvements and rentals  changes in taxation or zoning laws  government regulation  availability of financing on acceptable terms or at all  potential liability under environmental or other laws or regulations  and general competitive factors 
the rents we receive and the occupancy levels at our properties may decline as a result of adverse changes in any of these factors 
if our rental revenues decline  we generally would expect to have less cash available to pay our indebtedness and distribute to our shareholders 
in addition  some of our major expenses  including mortgage payments  real estate taxes and maintenance costs  generally do not decline when the related rents decline 
we depend on leasing space to tenants on economically favorable terms and collecting rent from our tenants  who may not be able to pay 
our financial results depend on leasing space in our properties to tenants on economically favorable terms 
in addition  because substantially all of our income comes from renting of real property  our income  funds available to pay indebtedness and funds available for distribution to our shareholders will decrease if a significant number of our tenants cannot pay their rent 
if a tenant does not pay its rent  we might not be able to enforce our rights as landlord without delays and might incur substantial legal costs 
for information regarding the bankruptcy of our tenants  see bankruptcy of tenants may decrease our revenues and available cash below 
bankruptcy or insolvency of tenants may decrease our revenues and available cash 
a number of companies  including some of our tenants  have declared bankruptcy in recent years  and other tenants may declare bankruptcy or become insolvent in the future 
if a major tenant declares bankruptcy or becomes insolvent  the rental property where it leases space may have lower revenues and operational difficulties  and  in the case of our shopping centers  we may have difficulty leasing the remainder of the affected property 
our leases generally do not contain restrictions designed to ensure the creditworthiness of its tenants 
as a result  the bankruptcy or insolvency of a major tenant could result in a lower level of funds from operations available for distribution to our shareholders or the payment of our indebtedness 
in february  koninklijke ahold nv  parent of stop shop  announced that it overstated its and earnings by at least million and is under investigation by the us justice department and securities and exchange commission 
see item properties retail segment former bradlees locations for information about former bradlees leases guaranteed by stop shop 
we cannot predict what effect  if any  this situation may have on stop shop s ability to satisfy its obligation under the bradlees guarantees and rent for existing stop shop leases aggregating approximately million per annum 
the risk that some of our tenants may declare bankruptcy has been higher because of the september  terrorist attacks and the resulting decline in the economy 
if there is not a sustained recovery of the economy  this risk may increase 
all of our temperature controlled logistics warehouses are leased to one tenant  and that tenant is experiencing operating difficulties 
the operating partnership owns a general partnership interest in a partnership  which we refer to as the vornado crescent portland partnership  that owns cold storage warehouses nationwide with an aggregate of approximately million cubic feet of refrigerated  frozen and dry storage space 
in  the vornado crescent portland partnership sold all of the non real estate assets encompassing the operations of the temperature controlled business to a new partnership named americold logistics  owned by vornado operating company  an independent  public company  which we refer to as vornado operating  and by crescent operating inc americold logistics leases the underlying temperature controlled warehouses used in this business from the vornado crescent portland partnership the landlord which continues to own the real estate 
during  americold logistics generated approximately of our ebitda 
the leases  as amended  generally have a year term with two five year renewal options and provide for the payment of fixed base rent and percentage rent based on revenue americold logistics receives from its customers 
the contractual rent for was  the landlord s share of annual maintenance capital expenditures is  in accordance with the leases  americold logistics deferred payment of  of rent due to the landlord  of which our share was  based on the joint venture s policy of recognizing rental income when earned and collection is assured or cash is received  the joint venture did not recognize the amount of the rent deferred by americold logistics in the year ended december  at december   our share of the joint venture s total deferred rent receivable from the tenant is  to the extent that the operations of americold logistics may affect its ability to pay rent  including percentage rent due under the leases  we indirectly bear the risks associated with americold logistics cold storage business 
the cold storage business is extremely competitive 
factors affecting americold logistics ability to compete include  among others  a general economic conditions  b customer policies about outsourcing warehouse and logistic services c warehouse locations  d customer mix and e availability  quality and price of additional services 
real estate is a competitive business 
for a discussion of risks related to competition in the real estate business  see item business competition 
we may incur costs to comply with environmental laws 
for a discussion of risks related to the company s compliance with environmental laws  see item business environmental regulations 
some of our potential losses may not be covered by insurance 
for a discussion of risks related to our insurance coverage  see item business insurance 
our investments are concentrated in the new york city new jersey and washington  dc metropolitan areas 
circumstances affecting these areas generally could adversely affect our business 
a significant proportion of our properties are in the new york city new jersey and washington  dc metropolitan areas and are affected by the economic cycles and risks inherent to those regions 
during  of our ebitda came from properties located in new jersey and the new york city and washington  dc metropolitan areas 
in addition  we may continue to concentrate a significant portion of our future acquisitions in new jersey and the new york city and washington  dc metropolitan areas 
like other real estate markets  the real estate markets in these areas have experienced economic downturns in the past  and we cannot predict how the current economic conditions will impact these markets in both the short and long term 
further declines in the economy or a decline in the real estate markets in these areas could hurt our financial performance and the value of our properties 
the factors affecting economic conditions in these regions include space needs of the united states government  business layoffs or downsizing  industry slowdowns  relocations of businesses  changing demographics  increased telecommuting and use of alternative work places  financial performance and productivity of the publishing  advertising  financial  technology  retail  insurance and real estate industries  infrastructure quality  and any oversupply of or reduced demand for real estate 
it is impossible for us to assess the future effects of the current uncertain trends in the economic and investment climates of the new york city new jersey and washington  dc regions  and more generally of the united states  or the real estate markets in these areas 
if these conditions persist or if any local  national or global economic recovery is of a short term  businesses and future profitability may be adversely affected 
terrorist attacks such as those of september  in new york city and the washington  dc area may adversely affect the value of our properties and our ability to generate cash flow 
we have significant investments in large metropolitan areas  including the new york new jersey  washington  dc and chicago metropolitan areas 
in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks  tenants in these areas may choose to relocate their business to less populated  lower profile areas of the united states that may be percieved to be less likely targets of future terrorist activity 
this in turn would trigger a decrease in the demand for space in these areas  which could increase vacancies in our properties and force us to lease our properties on less favorable terms 
as a result  the value of our properties and the level of our revenues could decline materially 
we may acquire or sell additional assets or develop additional properties 
our failure or inability to consummate these transactions or manage the results of these transactions could adversely affect our operations and financial results 
we have grown rapidly through acquisitions 
we may not be able to maintain this rapid growth and our failure to do so could adversely affect our stock price 
we have experienced rapid growth in recent years  increasing our total assets from approximately million at december  to approximately billion at december  we may not be able to maintain a similar rate of growth in the future or manage our growth effectively 
our failure to do so may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and ability to pay dividends to our shareholders 
we may acquire or develop new properties and this may create risks 
we may acquire or develop properties or acquire other real estate companies when we believe that an acquisition or development is consistent with our business strategies 
we may not  however  succeed in consummating desired acquisitions or in completing developments on time or within budget 
we also may not succeed in leasing newly developed or acquired properties at rents sufficient to cover their costs of acquisition or development and operations 
difficulties in integrating acquisitions may prove costly or time consuming and could divert management s attention 
it may be difficult to buy and sell real estate quickly 
real estate investments are relatively difficult to buy and sell quickly 
consequently  we may have limited ability to vary our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions 
we may not be permitted to dispose of certain properties or pay down the debt associated with those properties when we might otherwise desire to do so without incurring additional costs 
as part of an acquisition of a property  including our january   acquisition of cescr s million square foot portfolio  we may agree  and in the case of cescr did agree  with the seller that we will not dispose of the acquired properties or reduce the mortgage indebtedness on them for significant periods of time unless we pay certain of the resulting tax costs of the seller 
these agreements could result in our holding on to properties that we would otherwise sell and not pay down or refinance indebtedness that we would otherwise pay down or refinance 
on january   we completed the acquisition of the interest in cescr that we did not previously own 
the terms of the merger restrict our ability to sell or otherwise dispose of  or to finance or refinance  the properties formerly owned by charles e 
smith commercial realty lp  which could result in our inability to sell these properties at an opportune time and increased costs to us 
subject to limited exceptions  we are restricted from selling or otherwise transferring or disposing of certain properties located in the crystal city area of arlington  virginia or an interest in our division that manages the majority of our office properties in the washington  dc metropolitan area  which we refer to as the cescr division  for a period of years with respect to certain properties located in the crystal city area of arlington  virginia or six years with respect to an interest in the cescr division 
these restrictions  which currently cover approximately million square feet of space  could result in our inability to sell these properties or an interest in the cescr division at an opportune time and increase costs to us 
our organizational and financial structure gives rise to operational and financial risks 
we may not be able to obtain capital to make investments 
we depend primarily on external financing to fund the growth of our business 
this is because one of the requirements of the internal revenue code of  as amended  for a reit is that it distribute of its net taxable income  excluding net capital gains  to its shareholders there is a separate requirement to distribute net capital gains or pay a corporate level tax in lieu 
our access to debt or equity financing depends on the willingness of third parties to lend or make equity investments and on conditions in the capital markets generally 
we and other companies in the real estate industry have experienced limited availability of financing from time to time 
although we believe that we will be able to finance any investments we may wish to make in the foreseeable future  new financing may not be available on acceptable terms 
for information about our available sources of funds  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources and the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
vornado realty trust depends on its direct and indirect subsidiaries dividends and distributions  and these subsidiaries creditors and preferred security holders are entitled to payment of amounts payable to them by the subsidiaries before the subsidiaries may pay any dividends or distributions to vornado realty trust 
substantially all of vornado realty trust s assets are held through its operating partnership which holds substantially all of its properties and assets through subsidiaries 
the operating partnership therefore depends for substantially all of its cash flow on cash distributions to it by its subsidiaries  and vornado realty trust in turn depends for substantially all of its cash flow on cash distributions to it by the operating partnership 
the creditors of each of the vornado realty trust s direct and indirect subsidiaries are entitled to payment of that subsidiary s obligations to them  when due and payable  before distributions may be made by that subsidiary to its equity holders 
thus  the operating partnership s ability to make distributions to holders of units depends on its subsidiaries ability first to satisfy their obligations to their creditors and then to make distributions to the operating partnership 
likewise  vornado realty trust s ability to pay dividends to holders of common and preferred shares depends on the operating partnership s ability first to satisfy its obligations to its creditors and make distributions payable to holders of preferred units and then to make distributions to vornado realty trust 
furthermore  the holders of preferred units of the operating partnership are entitled to receive preferred distributions before payment of distributions to holders of common units of the operating partnership  including vornado realty trust 
thus  vornado realty trust ability to pay dividends to holders of its common shares and satisfy its debt obligations depends on the operating partnership s ability first to satisfy its obligations to its creditors and make distributions payable to holders of preferred units and then to make distributions to vornado realty trust 
there are currently series of preferred units of the operating partnership not held by vornado realty trust that have preference over vornado realty trust common shares 
the total liquidation value of these series of preferred units is approximately  in addition  vornado realty trust participation in any distribution of the assets of any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries upon the liquidation  reorganization or insolvency of the subsidiary  is only after the claims of the creditors  including trade creditors  and preferred security holders  if any  of the subsidiary are satisfied 
we have indebtedness  and this indebtedness may increase 
as of december   we had approximately billion in total debt outstanding 
our ratio of total debt to total enterprise value was 
when we say enterprise value in the preceding sentence  we mean market equity value of vornado realty trust plus debt less cash 
in the future  we may incur additional debt  and thus increase its ratio of total debt to total enterprise value  to finance acquisitions or property developments 
vornado realty trust might fail to qualify or remain qualified as a reit 
although we believe that we will remain organized and will continue to operate so as to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes  we might fail to remain qualified in this way 
qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes is governed by highly technical and complex provisions of the internal revenue code for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations 
our qualification as a reit also depends on various facts and circumstances that are not entirely within our control 
in addition  legislation  new regulations  administrative interpretations or court decisions might significantly change the tax laws with respect to the requirements for qualification as a reit or the federal income tax consequences of qualification as a reit 
if  with respect to any taxable year  vornado realty trust fails to maintain its qualification as a reit  it could not deduct distributions to shareholders in computing its taxable income and would have to pay federal income tax on its taxable income at regular corporate rates 
the federal income tax payable would include any applicable alternative minimum tax 
if vornado realty trust had to pay federal income tax  the amount of money available to distribute to shareholders and pay its indebtedness would be reduced for the year or years involved  and vornado realty trust would no longer be required to distribute money to shareholders 
in addition  vornado realty trust would also be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost  unless it was entitled to relief under the relevant statutory provisions 
although vornado realty trust currently intends to operate in a manner designed to allow it to qualify as a reit  future economic  market  legal  tax or other considerations may cause it to revoke the reit election 
loss of the company s key personnel could harm our operations and adversely affect the value of our common shares 
we are dependent on the efforts of steven roth  the chairman of the board of trustees and chief executive officer of vornado realty trust  and michael d 
fascitelli  the president of vornado realty trust 
while we believe that we could find replacements for these key personnel  the loss of their services could harm our operations and adversely affect the value or our common shares 
vornado realty trust s charter documents and applicable law may hinder any attempt to acquire us 
generally  for vornado realty trust to maintain its qualification as a reit under the internal revenue code  not more than in value of the outstanding shares of beneficial interest of vornado realty trust may be owned  directly or indirectly  by five or fewer individuals at any time during the last half of vornado realty trust s taxable year 
the internal revenue code defines individuals for purposes of the requirement described in the preceding sentence to include some types of entities 
under vornado realty trust s amended and restated declaration of trust  as amended  no person may own more than of the outstanding common shares or of the outstanding preferred shares  with some exceptions for persons who held common shares in excess of the limit before vornado realty trust adopted the limit and other persons approved by vornado realty trust s board of trustees 
these restrictions on transferability and ownership may delay  deter or prevent a change in control of the company or other transaction that might involve a premium price or otherwise be in the best interest of the shareholders 
we refer to vornado realty trust s amended and restated declaration of trust  as amended  as the declaration of trust 
vornado realty trust s board of trustees is divided into three classes of trustees 
trustees of each class are chosen for three year staggered terms 
staggered terms of trustees may reduce the possibility of a tender offer or an attempt to change control of the company  even though a tender offer or change in control might be in the best interest of vornado realty trust s shareholders 
the declaration of trust authorizes the board of trustees to  cause vornado realty trust to issue additional authorized but unissued common shares or preferred shares  classify or reclassify  in one or more series  any unissued preferred shares  set the preferences  rights and other terms of any classified or reclassified shares that vornado realty trust issues  and increase  without shareholder approval  the number of shares of beneficial interest that vornado realty trust may issue 
the board of trustees could establish a series of preferred shares whose terms could delay  deter or prevent a change in control of the company or other transaction that might involve a premium price or otherwise be in the best interest of vornado realty trust s shareholders  although the board of trustees does not now intend to establish a series of preferred shares of this kind 
vornado realty trust s declaration of trust and bylaws contain other provisions that may delay  deter or prevent a change in control of the company or other transaction that might involve a premium price or otherwise be in the best interest of the shareholders 
under the maryland general corporation law  as amended  which we refer to as the mgcl  as applicable to real estate investment trusts  certain business combinations  including certain mergers  consolidations  share exchanges and asset transfers and certain issuances and reclassifications of equity securities  between a maryland real estate investment trust and any person who beneficially owns ten percent or more of the voting power of the trust s shares or an affiliate or an associate  as defined in the mgcl  of the trust who  at any time within the two year period before the date in question  was the beneficial owner of ten percent or more of the voting power of the then outstanding voting shares of beneficial interest of the trust  which we refer to as an interested shareholder  or an affiliate of the interested shareholder are prohibited for five years after the most recent date on which the interested shareholder becomes an interested shareholder 
after that five year period  any business combination of these kinds must be recommended by the board of trustees of the trust and approved by the affirmative vote of at least a of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of outstanding shares of beneficial interest of the trust and b two thirds of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of voting shares of the trust other than shares held by the interested shareholder with whom  or with whose affiliate  the business combination is to be effected  unless  among other conditions  the trust s common shareholders receive a minimum price  as defined in the mgcl  for their shares and the consideration is received in cash or in the same form as previously paid by the interested shareholder for its common shares 
the provisions of the mgcl do not apply  however  to business combinations that are approved or exempted by the board of trustees of the applicable trust before the interested shareholder becomes an interested shareholder  and a person is not an interested shareholder if the board of trustees approved in advance the transaction by which the person otherwise would have become an interested shareholder 
in approving a transaction  the board may provide that its approval is subject to compliance  at or after the time of approval  with any terms and conditions determined by the board

as of december    was the carrying balance on our books for the amount outstanding under the revolving credit agreement 
the company and vornado operating are parties to an agreement under which  among other things  a we will offer vornado operating  under certain circumstances  an opportunity to become the lessee of certain real property owned now or in the future by us under mutually satisfactory lease terms and b vornado operating will not make any real estate investment or other investments known as reit qualified investments unless it first offers us the opportunity to make the investment and we have rejected that opportunity

the number of shares of the company and the market for those shares give rise to various risks 
vornado realty trust has many shares available for future sale  which could hurt the market price of its shares 
as of february   we had authorized but unissued   common shares of beneficial interest  
par value  and  preferred shares of beneficial interest  no par value 
we may issue these additional shares from time to time in public or private offerings or in connection with acquisitions 
in addition  as of february    vornado realty trust common shares were reserved for issuance upon redemption of operating partnership units 
some of these shares may be sold in the public market after registration under the securities act under registration rights agreements between the company and some holders of units of the operating partnership 
these shares may also be sold in the public market under rule under the securities act or other available exemptions from registration 
in addition  vornado realty trust has reserved a number of common shares for issuance under its employee benefit plans  and these common shares will be available for sale from time to time 
vornado realty trust has awarded shares of restricted stock and granted options to purchase additional common shares to some of its executive officers and employees 
we cannot predict the effect that future sales of our common shares  preferred shares or operating partnership units  or the perception that sales of common shares  preferred or operating partnership units could occur  will have on the market prices for vornado realty trust s shares 
changes in market conditions could hurt the market price of vornado realty trust s shares 
the value of the vornado realty trust s shares depends on various market conditions  which may change from time to time 
among the market conditions that may affect the value of the vornado realty trust s shares are the following the extent of institutional investor interest in the company  the reputation of reits generally and the attractiveness of their equity securities in comparison to other equity securities  including securities issued by other real estate companies  and fixed income securities  our financial condition and performance  and general financial market conditions 
the stock market in recent years has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies 
increased market interest rates may hurt the value of vornado realty trust s shares 
we believe that investors consider the distribution rate on reit shares  expressed as a percentage of the price of the shares  relative to market interest rates as an important factor in deciding whether to buy or sell the shares 
if market interest rates go up  prospective purchasers of reit shares may expect a higher distribution rate 
higher interest rates would likely increase our borrowing costs and might decrease funds available for distribution 
thus  higher market interest rates could cause the market price of vornado realty trust s shares to decline

in addition  the company has a interest in a partnership that owns cold storage warehouses nationwide 
the company s business objective is to maximize shareholder value 
the company s measures its success in meeting this objective by the total return to its shareholders 
below is a table comparing the company s performance to the morgan stanley reit index rms for the following periods ending december  total return vornado rms one year three years five years ten years from inception on july  the company intends to continue to achieve its business objective by pursuing its investment philosophy and executing its operating strategies through maintaining a superior team of operating and investment professionals and an entrepreneurial spirit 
investing in properties in select markets  such as new york city and washington  dc  where we believe there is high likelihood of capital appreciation 
acquiring quality properties at a discount to replacement cost and where there is a significant potential for higher rents 
investing in retail properties in select under stored locations such as the new york city metropolitan area 
developing redeveloping the company s existing properties to increase returns and maximize value 
the company competes with a large number of real estate property owners and developers 
principal factors of competition are rent charged  attractiveness of location and quality and breadth of services provided 
the company s success depends upon  among other factors  trends of the national and local economies  financial condition and operating results of current and prospective tenants and customers  availability and cost of capital  construction and renovation costs  taxes  governmental regulations  legislation and population trends 
the current economic recovery is fostered  in part  by low interest rates  federal tax cuts  and increases in government spending 
to the extent this recovery stalls  the company may experience lower occupancy rates which may lead to lower initial rental rates  higher leasing costs and a corresponding decrease in net income  funds from operations and cash flow 
alternatively  if the recovery continues  the company may experience higher occupancy rates leading to higher initial rents and higher interest rates causing an increase in the company s weighted average cost of capital and a corresponding effect on net income  funds from operations and cash flow

critical accounting policies in preparing the consolidated financial statements management has made estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
set forth below is a summary of the accounting policies that management believes are critical to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the summary should be read in conjunction with the more complete discussion of the company s accounting policies included in note to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
real estate real estate is carried at cost  net of accumulated depreciation and amortization 
as of december   the company s carrying amount of its real estate  net of accumulated depreciation is billion 
maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred 
depreciation requires an estimate by management of the useful life of each property and improvement as well as an allocation of the costs associated with a property to its various components 
if the company does not allocate these costs appropriately or incorrectly estimates the useful lives of its real estate  depreciation expense may be misstated 
upon acquisitions of real estate  the company assesses the fair value of acquired assets including land  buildings  tenant improvements and beginning in  identified intangibles such as acquired above and below market leases and the value of acquired in place leases in accordance with statements of financial accounting standards sfas no 
and and acquired liabilities  and allocates purchase price based on these assessments 
the company assesses fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and capitalization rates and available market information 
estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results  known trends  and market economic conditions that may affect the property 
the company s properties are reviewed for impairment if events or circumstances change indicating that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
if the company incorrectly estimates the values at acquisition or the undiscounted cash flows  initial allocations of purchase price and future impairment charges may be different 
the impact of the company s estimates in connection with acquisitions and future impairment analysis could be material to the company s consolidated financial statements 
identified intangible assets and goodwill upon an acquisition of a business the company records intangible assets acquired at their estimated fair value separate and apart from goodwill 
the company amortizes identified intangible assets that are determined to have finite lives which are based on the period over which the assets are expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the future cash flows of the business acquired 
intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an intangible asset is not recoverable and its carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value 
the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the net of the amounts assigned to assets acquired including identified intangible assets and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill 
goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at a level of reporting referred to as a reporting unit on an annual basis  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
an impairment loss for an asset group is allocated to the long lived assets of the group on a pro rata basis using the relative carrying amounts of those assets  unless the fair value of specific components of the reporting group are determinable without undue cost and effort 
as of december  and  the carrying amounts of the company s identified intangible assets are  and  and the carrying amount of goodwill is  arising from the acquisition of building maintenance services and  respectively 
such amounts are included in other assets on the company s consolidated balance sheet 
in addition  the company has  and  of deferred credits as of december  and  which are included as liabilities on the company s consolidated balance sheet 
if the company incorrectly estimates the fair value of these assets at acquisition or in connection with impairment testing  or incorrectly estimates the useful lives of finite life intangible assets  the impact to the company s consolidated financial statements could be material 
notes and mortgage loans receivable the company s policy is to record mortgages and notes receivable at the stated principal amount net of any discount or premiums 
as of december   the carrying amount of notes and mortgage loans receivable was  the company accretes or amortizes any discounts or premiums over the life of the related loan receivable utilizing the effective interest method 
the company evaluates the collectibility of both interest and principal of each of its loans  if circumstances warrant  to determine whether it is impaired 
a loan is considered to be impaired  when based on current information and events  it is probable that the company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the existing contractual terms 
when a loan is considered to be impaired  the amount of the loss accrual is calculated by comparing the recorded investment to the value determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at the loan s effective interest rate or  as a practical expedient  to the value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
interest on impaired loans is recognized on a cash basis 
partially owned entities as of december   the carrying amount of investments and advances to partially owned entities  including alexander s  was  the company considers apb the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock  sop accounting for investments in real estate ventures  eitf investors accounting for an investee when the investor has the majority of the voting interest but the minority partners have certain approval or veto rights  to determine the method of accounting for each of its partially owned entities 
in determining whether the company has a controlling interest in a partially owned entity and the requirement to consolidate the accounts of that entity  it considers factors such as ownership interest  board representation  management representation  authority to make decisions  and contractual and substantive participating rights of the partners members 
the company has concluded that it does not control a partially owned entity  despite an ownership interest of or greater  if the approval of all of the partners members is contractually required with respect to major decisions  such as operating and capital budgets  the sale  exchange or other disposition of real property  the hiring of a chief executive officer  the commencement  compromise or settlement of any lawsuit  legal proceeding or arbitration or the placement of new or additional financing secured by assets of the venture 
this is the case with respect to the company s interest in temperature controlled logistics  interest in starwood ceruzzi venture  and interests in monmouth mall  martparc wells  martparc orleans  and seventh avenue 
if the company is able to unilaterally make decisions for a partially owned entity  the company has concluded that it controls the entity and therefore consolidates the entity 
the company accounts for investments on the equity method when its ownership interest is greater than and less than  and the company does not have direct or indirect control 
when partially owned entities are in partnership form  the threshold may be reduced 
equity method investments are initially recorded at cost and subsequently adjusted for the company s share of net income or loss and cash contributions and distributions to and from these entities 
all other investments are accounted for on the cost method 
on a periodic basis the company evaluates whether there are any indicators that the value of the company s investments in partially owned entities are impaired 
the ultimate realization of the company s investment in partially owned entities is dependent on a number of factors including the performance of the investee and market conditions 
if the company determines that a decline in the value of the investee is other than temporary  an impairment charge would be recorded 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company periodically evaluates the collectibility of amounts due from tenants and maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts  as at december  for estimated losses resulting from the inability of tenants to make required payments under the lease agreement 
the company also maintains an allowance for receivables arising from the straight lining of rents  as at december  
this receivable arises from earnings recognized in excess of amounts currently due under the lease agreements 
management exercises judgment in establishing these allowances and considers payment history and current credit status in developing these estimates 
if estimates differ from actual results  this would impact reported results

these rents are recognized over the non cancelable term of the related leases on a straight line basis which includes the effects of rent steps and rent abatements under the leases

this revenue is recognized in accordance with the booth rental contracts when the trade shows have occurred

if the company incorrectly determines the collectibility of its revenue  its net income and assets could be misstated 
incometaxes the company operates in a manner intended to enable it to continue to qualify as a real estate investment trust reit under sections of the internal revenue code of  as amended

if the company fails to distribute the required amount of income to its shareholders  it would fail to qualify as a reit and substantial adverse tax consequences may result 
net income and ebitda for the years ended december   and below is a summary of net income and ebitda by segment for the years ended december   and on january   the company revised its definition of ebitda to comply with the securities and exchange commission s regulation g concerning non gaap financial measures 
the revised definition of ebitda includes minority interest  gains losses on the sale of depreciable real estate and income arising from the straight lining of rent and the amortization of acquired in place leases 
accordingly  ebitda for all periods disclosed represents earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
management considers ebitda a supplemental measure for making decisions and assessing the unlevered performance of its segments as it is related to the return on assets as opposed to the levered return on equity 
as properties are bought and sold based on a multiple of ebitda  management utilizes this measure to make investment decisions as well as to compare the performance of its assets to that of its peers 
ebitda is not a surrogate for net income because net income is after interest expense and accordingly  is a measure of return on equity as opposed to return on assets

consolidation of variable interest entities fin in january  the fasb issued fin  as amended in december by fin r  which deferred the effective date until the first interim or annual reporting period ending after march  fin r requires the consolidation of an entity by an enterprise known as a primary beneficiary  i if that enterprise has a variable interest that will absorb a majority of the entity s expected losses  if they occur  receive a majority of the entity s expected residual returns  if they occur  or both and ii if the entity is a variable interest entity vie  as defined 
an entity qualifies as a variable interest entity if i the total equity investment at risk in the entity is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties or ii the equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest in the entity 
the initial determination of whether an entity is a variable interest entity shall be made as of the date at which an enterprise becomes involved with the entity and re evaluated as of the date of triggering events  as defined 
the company has evaluated each partially owned entity to determine whether any qualify as a vie  and if so  whether the company is the primary beneficiary  as defined 
the company has determined that its investment in newkirk mlp  in which it owns a equity interest see note investments in partially owned entities to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report form k  qualifies as a vie 
the company has determined that it is not considered the primary beneficiary and  accordingly  consolidation is not required 
the company s maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement in newkirk is limited to its equity investment of approximately  as of december  in addition  the company has variable interests in certain other entities which are primarily financing arrangements 
the company has evaluated these entities in accordance with fin r and has determined that they are not vies 
based on the company s evaluations  it does not believe that the adoption of fin r will have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements 
sfas no 
accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
which establishes standards for classifying and measuring as liabilities certain financial instruments that embody obligations of the issuer and have characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
the adoption of sfas no 
on july   required the company to reclassify all of its series f preferred units million liquidation value from minority interest to a liability on its consolidated balance sheet 
in connection therewith  the company also reclassified  of payments made to the holders of these units in the three months ended december  as interest expense 
on november   the fasb deferred  indefinitely  the application of paragraphs and of sfas no 
as it relates to mandatory redeemable non controlling interests in consolidated subsidiaries in order to address a number of interpretation and implementation issues 
the company has determined that one of its consolidated  finite life joint ventures qualifies as a mandatory redeemable non controlling interest 
if the company were required to adopt the provisions of paragraphs and on the statement s effective date  the company would have to reclassify as a liability  amounts included in minority interest of approximately million and record the minority partner s interest as a liability at its estimated settlement value which would result in a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of approximately million 
this liability would be required to be reviewed each quarter and any changes in its settlement value would be recorded as interest expense 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company has exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates 
market interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors  beyond the control of the company 
various financial vehicles exist which would allow management to mitigate the impact of interest rate fluctuations on the company s cash flows and earnings 
as of december   the company has an interest rate swap as described in footnote to the table below 
in addition  during the company purchased two interest rate caps with notional amounts aggregating  and simultaneously sold two interest rate caps with the same aggregate notional amount on substantially the same terms as the caps purchased 
as the significant terms of these arrangements are the same  the effects of a revaluation of these instruments are expected to substantially offset one another 
management may engage in additional hedging strategies in the future  depending on management s analysis of the interest rate environment and the costs and risks of such strategies 
the company s exposure to a change in interest rates on its wholly owned and partially owned debt all of which arises out of non trading activity is as follows in thousands  except per share amounts december  balance weighted average interest rate effect of change in base rates december  balance weighted average interest rate wholly owned debt variable rate fixed rate debt of partially owned entities variable rate fixed rate minority interest total decrease in the company s annual net income per share diluted includes  for the company s senior unsecured notes due  as the company entered into interest rate swap agreements that effectively converted the interest rate from a fixed rate of to a floating rate of libor plus  based upon the trailing month libor rate if set on december  
in accordance with sfas  as amended  accounting for these swaps requires the company to fair value the debt at each reporting period 
at december   the fair value adjustment was  and is included in the balance of the senior unsecured notes above 
the fair value of the company s debt  based on discounted cash flows at the current rate at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings for the remaining term of such debt  exceeds the aggregate carrying amount by approximately  at december
