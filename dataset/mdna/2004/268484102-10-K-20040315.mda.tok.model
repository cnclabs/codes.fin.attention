item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
in addition  for information on our critical accounting policies and the judgment made in their application  please read critical accounting policies and estimates beginning on page overview the primary macroeconomic growth indicators of our business include general growth in the economy  international trade  particularly out of asia  the level of high tech spending and the increase in outsourcing of logistics projects 
drivers that we control and focus on internally are our ability to i link transportation services with our logistics services  ii cross sell our services to existing and prospective customers  and iii collaborate with our customers to provide flexible  cost effective and profitable supply chain solutions 
we achieved revenues of billion for the year ended december   a increase over revenues of billion in our financial position was strengthened by record gross and net revenues in the fourth quarter of despite growth in revenues  we remain committed to leveraging our infrastructure in north america by containing our facility related expenses  which have decreased as a percentage of net revenues from to our results of operations in were impacted by  among other things  the following leveraging our global network to increase volumes across all service offerings  elimination of our dedicated charter network  a weak economy during the first half of the year  the continued shift away from united states priority to deferred shipments by our customers  airline rate increases in asia  and operating losses on two logistics projects in europe 
leveraging our global network 
our merger with circle in established a global network for our services 
in  we leveraged our global network and our ability to cross sell services to increase volumes for all of our service offerings 
in addition  our balanced product offering enabled us to provide flexible solutions to our customers both domestically and internationally 
our services improved as we have consolidated most operations in which we had duplicate facilities at the time of the merger with circle and maintained relatively consistent selling  general and administrative expenses on higher net revenues 
elimination of our dedicated charter network 
as of december  we were no longer a party to any dedicated charter agreements or network 
without such a network  we were able to capitalize on available capacity in the market to move our customers goods at the lowest cost available 
we believe the elimination of such fixed costs will further enable us to provide flexible solutions through a non asset based model of services 
shift from priority to deferred shipments 
us overnight shipment counts continued to decline in as a result of a subdued demand by our customers  reflecting the weak economy and continued improvements by the industry in timely ground deliveries 
in addition  the continued shift to manufacturing operations overseas has reduced the amount of domestic activity but has resulted in increased us imports 
management believes that if the economy continues to recover  shipment of products will be expedited and inventory levels will continue to build as customers gain more confidence in the economic recovery 
we believe our low cost domestic model is capable of continuing to generate domestic growth with a mix of priority next flight out  next day or second day time definite and economy deferred third through fifth day shipments 
rate increases in asia 
our third quarter and most of our fourth quarter performance was impacted by airline price increases out of asia that were not matched with corresponding price increases to our customers due to weak air freight demand 
the airline pricing pressure has moderately improved in january and we believe we will be better positioned in to sustain the impact of such rate increases by the airlines 
the steamship carriers also continued to increase their rates during the year  with our freight forwarding operations having moderate success in passing these price increases to customers 
logistics projects in europe 
our first and second quarter performance in was impacted by operating losses on two logistics projects in europe 
the performance on these projects improved during the latter half of and rebounded to profitability by year end 
we terminated these projects effective march our focus in will be to improve upon priority product shipment counts  streamline processes through our global deployment of our financial and operational information technology systems see business information systems and continue to leverage our north america infrastructure 
results of operations our principle services are air freight forwarding  ocean freight forwarding  customs brokerage and other value added logistics services 
the following table provides certain statement of operations data attributable to our principle services during the periods indicated 
revenues for air freight and ocean freight consolidations indirect shipments include reimbursements from customers for the cost of transporting such freight 
revenues for air freight and ocean freight agency or direct shipments  customs brokerage and import services  include only the fees or commissions for these services 
a comparison of gross revenues by product best measures the relative importance of our principle services  while a comparison of net revenue margins net revenues as a percent of gross revenues best measures the performance of each product line 
a comparison of operating expenses as a percent of net revenues considers the relationship between operating expenses and operating revenues

the air freight forwarding margin net revenues as a percentage of revenues decreased to for as compared to for air freight forwarding net revenue margins declined in all geographic divisions  primarily due to airline rate increases we were not able to recover through comparable price increases to our customers and the shift from priority to deferred shipments in the us air freight forwarding net revenue margin was also negatively impacted by an unfavorable settlement with kitty hawk  inc  a wholesale transportation provider  stemming from a dispute in the dispute was resolve d by an arbitration panel during the third quarter of and we recorded a charge of million in air freight forwarding cost of transportation

other selling  general and administrative expenses increased  or  to million in compared to million in as a percentage of net revenues  other selling  general and administrative expenses were in compared to in this decrease is primarily due to management initiatives on costs savings 
other selling  general and administrative expenses also decreased as a result of a million gain on the sale of our facility in boston in september and a  charge recorded during the third quarter of related to a management decision not to use certain architectural design plans for a proposed building in canada 
these cost savings were partially offset by an increase in facility costs  insurance premiums and depreciation expense 
although we completed the consolidation of many of our facilities  our facility costs increased by approximately million because we are leasing more space than in the previous year for our expanded warehousing and logistics services primarily in europe and north america  expansion of several stations in the us and the acquisition of mif in april the increase in depreciation expense was largely related to increases in computer software and office equipment depreciation

future lease obligations consist of our remaining lease obligations under noncancelable operating leases at domestic and international locations that we are in the process of vacating and consolidating due to excess capacity resulting from having multiple facilities in certain locations 
the provisions of our integration plan include the consolidation of facilities at approximately of our operating locations net of anticipated future recoveries from actual or expected sublease agreements

liquidity and capital resources general our ability to satisfy our debt obligations  fund working capital and make capital expenditures depends upon our future performance  which is subject to general economic conditions and other factors  some of which are beyond our control 
if we achieve significant near term revenue growth  we may experience a need for increased working capital financing as a result of the difference between our collection cycles and the timing of our payments to vendors 
we make significant disbursements on behalf of our customers for transportation costs primarily ocean and customs duties for which the customer is the primary obligor 
the billings to customers for these disbursements  which are several times the amount of revenues and fees derived from these transactions  are not recorded as revenues and expense on our statement of operations  rather  they are reflected in our trade receivables and trade payables 
growth in the level of this activity or lengthening of the period of time between incurring these costs and being reimbursed by our customers for these costs may negatively affect our liquidity 
as a non asset based freight forwarder  we do not have significant capital expenditures that would be required of an asset based forwarder 
we believe our anticipated capital expenditures for will be in the range of to million  with a range of to million expected on information systems expenditures

additionally  funds may not be available when needed and even if available  additional funds may be raised through financing arrangements and or the issuance of preferred or common stock or convertible securities on terms and prices significantly more favorable than those of the currently outstanding common stock  which could have the effect of diluting or adversely affecting the holdings or rights of our existing stockholders 
if adequate funds are unavailable  we may be required to delay  scale back or eliminate some of our operating activities  including  without limitation  the timing and extent of our marketing programs  and the extent and timing of hiring additional personnel 
we cannot provide assurance that additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all

the aggregate of the last four sub bullet points above is referred to as our eligible borrowing base 
the maximum amount that we can borrow at any particular time may be less than the amount of our revolving credit line because we are required to maintain a specified amount of borrowing availability under the restated credit facility based on our eligible borrowing base 
as of december   the required amount of borrowing availability is million 
the amount of borrowing availability is determined by subtracting the following from our eligible borrowing base our borrowings under the restated credit facility  and our accounts payable and the accounts payable of all of our domestic subsidiaries and our canadian operating subsidiary that remain unpaid more than the longer of i sixty days from their respective invoice dates or ii thirty days from their respective due dates 
the restated credit facility includes a million letter of credit subfacility 
we had million in letters of credit outstanding as of december  under this facility 
the collateral value associated with the revolving line of credit at december  was million  which exceeds the maximum revolving credit line of million 
no amounts were outstanding under the revolving line of credit as of december  therefore  our available  unused borrowing capacity was million as of december  for each tranche of principal borrowed under the revolving line of credit  we may elect an interest rate of either libor plus an applicable margin of  which is subject to adjustment to if the amount available to be borrowed under the line of credit  which we call our borrowing availability  is greater than or equal to million  if the borrowing availability is less than million  but greater than or equal to million  if the borrowing availability is less than million  but greater than or equal to million  and if the borrowing availability is less than million  or the prime rate announced by the bank  plus  if the borrowing availability is less than million  an applicable margin of

investment in miami air international  inc in july  we purchased of the outstanding common stock of miami air international  inc  a privately held domestic and international passenger charter airline headquartered in miami  florida  for approximately million in cash 
our primary objective for engaging in the transaction was to develop a business relationship with miami air in order to obtain access to an additional source of reliable freight charter capacity

nb sp  in connection with the miami air investment  miami air and egl entered into an aircraft charter agreement whereby miami air agreed to convert certain of its passenger aircraft to cargo aircraft and to provide aircraft charter services to us for a three year term 
in addition  we caused a standby letter of credit to be issued in favor of certain creditors for miami air to assist miami air in financing the conversion of its aircraft 
miami air agreed to pay us an annual fee equal to of the face amount of the letter of credit and to reimburse us for any payments made by us in respect to the letter of credit 
there were previously four aircraft subject to the aircraft charter agreement 
during  we paid miami air approximately million under the aircraft charter agreement for use of four cargo airplanes under an aircraft  crew  maintenance and insurance  or acmi  agreement 
the payments were based on market rates in effect at the time the lease was entered into 
in late february  egl and miami air mutually agreed to ground one of these aircraft because of the need for maintenance on that plane 
during the first four months of  there were three aircraft subject to the aircraft charter agreement and we paid approximately million related to this agreement 
in may  egl and miami air mutually agreed to cancel the aircraft charter agreement for the three planes as of may  and we agreed to pay  for services rendered in may and aircraft repositioning costs 
the weak economy and events of september  significantly reduced the demand for cargo plane services  particularly cargo planes 
as a result  the market value of these planes declined dramatically 
miami air made us aware that the amounts due miami air s bank which are secured by seven planes were significantly higher than the market value of those planes 
in addition  miami air had outstanding operating leases for and airplanes at above current market rates  including two planes that were expected to be delivered in throughout the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of  miami air was in discussions with its bank to obtain debt concessions on the seven planes  to buy out the lease on a cargo plane and to reduce the rates on the passenger planes 
miami air had informed us that its creditors had indicated a willingness to make concessions 
in may  we were informed that miami air s creditors were no longer willing to make concessions and that negotiations with its creditors had reached an impasse and no agreement appeared feasible 
during the first quarter of  we increased our investment in miami air  for our share of miami air s first quarter results of operations  then we recognized an other than temporary impairment of the entire carrying value of our million investment in miami air 
in addition  we recorded an accrual of million for our estimated exposure on the outstanding funded debt and letters of credit supported by the standby letter of credit 
during the third quarter of  miami air informed us that certain of its creditors had made certain concessions and  following negotiations initiated during the fourth quarter of  miami air replaced million of outstanding letters of credit with restricted ca sh during the first quarter of  effectively removing our obligation for those outstanding letters of credit 
in december  we recorded a credit million  reversing our accrual for our estimated exposure on the outstanding letters of credit 
as of december   miami air had a million letter of credit facility and million in letters of credit outstanding  including the million of outstanding letters of credit replaced with restricted cash in as of december   we had million of standby letters of credit in support of miami air s letter of credit facility

miami land purchase our operations in miami  florida were located in three different facilities 
in order to increase operational efficiencies  we acquired land to be used as the site for a new facility to consolidate our miami operations 
we acquired the land in august from a related party entity controlled by mr 
crane for million in cash  including acquisition costs of  this parcel of land had been previously identified by us as the most advantageous property on which to consolidate our miami operations 
we entered into negotiations on the land and reached agreement with the seller on terms 
however  given the downturn in the economy and our weakening financial condition at that point in time  we elected to delay purchasing this property until our financial condition improved 
on july   mr 
crane purchased the land in antici pation of reselling the land to egl 
our audit committee  consisting of five independent directors  engaged in an analysis and discussion regarding whether it was in the best interest of egl to enter into a purchase agreement to purchase this particular tract of land from mr 
crane 
the audit committee s analysis included  but was not limited to  obtaining an independent appraisal of the land  reviewing a comparative properties analysis performed by an outside independent real estate company and performing a cost benefit analysis for several different alternatives 
based upon the data obtained from the analysis  the audit committee determined the best alternative for egl  in its opinion  was for the company to purchase the property from mr 
crane 
the audit committee then made a recommendation to our board of directors  which includes six independent directors  to purchase this land at mr 
crane s purchase price plus carrying costs  which was lower than the current market va lue 
in august  our board of directors unanimously approved the purchase  with mr 
crane abstaining from the vote

egl subsidiaries in spain and portugal in april  circle sold a interest in two previously wholly owned subsidiaries in spain and portugal to peter gibert  who relocated to barcelona  spain 
mr

the agreed purchase price was million  paid one third at closing  and the balance to be paid in equal installments and months following closing 
the two installment payments were evidenced by a promissory note bearing interest at six percent and secured by a pledge of mr 
gibert s interest in the subsidiaries 
the loan was paid in full during in addition  the purchase agreement provides mr 
gibert with the right at his option to require circle  and now egl  to purchase his interest in the subsidiaries at a price based on the same valuation methodology 
after december  or earlier under certain circumstances  we have the right to require mr 
gibert to sell his entire interest in the subsidiaries at a price based on the valuation methodology 
consulting agreement in connection with mr 
gibert stepping down as chief executive officer of circle and relocating to spain in  mr 
gibert entered into a consulting agreement with circle pursuant to which he agreed to provide sales  marketing  strategic planning  acquisition  training and other assistance as reasonably requested wherever circle has operations  other than in the united states  spain and portugal 
the consulting agreement provided for annual compensation in the first year of  and annual compensation in the second and third years of  per year 
the consulting agreement  which originally was effective from january  to december  also prohibited mr 
gibert  directly or indirectly  from competing against circle during the term of the consulting agreement  plus six months thereafter

rental income was approximately  and  respectively  for the years ended december  and during and  we billed source one spares approximately  and  respectively  for freight forwarding services 
seasonality historically  our operating results have been subject to a limited degree to seasonal trends when measured on a quarterly basis 
typically  our first fiscal quarter is weaker when compared to our other fiscal quarters of the corresponding year 
the seasonality of our business is a result of a variety of factors  including holiday seasons  consumer demand  economic conditions and other factors beyond our control 
we cannot accurately forecast many of these factors  nor can we estimate accurately the relative influence of any particular factor 
as a result  there can be no assurance that historical patterns  if any  will continue in future periods 
critical accounting policies and estimates use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
management considers many factors in selecting appropriate operational and financial accounting policies and controls  and in developing the assumptions that are used in the preparation of these financial statements 
management must apply significant judgment in this process 
among the factors  but not fully inclusive of all factors that may be considered by management in these processes are the range of accounting policies permitted by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  management s understanding of the company s business both historical results and expected future results  the extent to which operational controls exist that provide high degrees of assurance that all desired information to assist in the estimation is available and reliable or whether there is greater uncertainty in the information that is available upon which to base the estimate  expectations of the future performance of the economy domestically  globally and within various sectors that serve our principal customers and suppliers of goods and services  expected rates of change  sensitivity and volatility associated with the assumptions used in developing estimates  and whether historical trends are expected to be representative of future trends 
the estimation process often times may yield a range of potentially reasonable estimates of the ultimate future outcomes and management must select an amount that lies within that range of reasonable estimates which may result in the selection of estimates which could be viewed as conservative or aggressive by others based upon the quantity  quality and risks associated with the variability that might be expected from the future outcome and the factors considered in developing the estimate 
management attempts to use its business and financial accounting judgment in selecting the most appropriate estimate  however  actual amounts could and will differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition revenues and freight consolidation costs are recognized at the time the freight departs the terminal of origin  one of the permissible methods authorized by emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 revenue and expense recognition for freight services in process 
this method generally results in recognition of revenues and gross profit earlier than methods that do not recognize revenues until proof of delivery is received 
customs brokerage and other revenues are recognized upon completing the documents necessary for customs clearance or completing other fee based services 
revenues recognized as an indirect air carrier or an ocean freight consolidator includes the direct carrier s charges to us for carrying the shipment 
revenues recognized in other capacities includes only the commission and fees received 
in january  eitf issue no 
 income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred was effective for us 
this issue clarified certain provisions of eitf no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  and among other things established when reimbursements are required to be shown gross as opposed to net 
we report the costs of certain reimbursed incidental activities on a gross basis in revenues and cost of transportation 
we derive our revenues from three principle sources air freight forwarding  ocean freight forwarding  and customs brokerage  import and logistics services 
air and ocean freight forwarding 
as a non asset based carrier  we do not own transportation assets 
instead  we generate the majority of our air and ocean freight revenues by purchasing transportation services from direct asset based carriers and reselling those services to our customers as an indirect carrier 
additionally  we generate air freight and ocean freight forwarding revenues to a lesser extent as an authorized cargo sales agent 
as an indirect carrier  we obtain shipments from our customers  consolidate shipments bound for a particular destination  determine the routing  select the direct carrier and tender each consolidated lot as a single shipment to the direct carrier for transportation to a distribution point 
we issue a house airway bill hawb or a house ocean bill of lading hobl to customers as the contract of carriage 
in turn  when the freight is physically tendered to a direct carrier  we receive a contract of carriage known as a master airway bill for air freight shipments and a master ocean bill of lading for ocean shipments 
we are the direct point of contact for service fulfillment and resolving any service failures or claims for lost or damaged freight resulting from either our or the direct carriers actions 
in addition  if we do not collect from our customers  we are st ill responsible for paying the direct carrier 
due to the high volume of freight we manage  we generally obtain lower rates from the direct carriers than the rates we charge our customers for individual shipments 
this rate differential is the primary source of our air and ocean freight net revenues 
we have complete discretion in selecting the means  route and procedures to be followed in the handling  transportation and delivery of freight 
we select the direct carrier that will provide the most economical routing in an effort to maximize net revenues 
revenues related to shipments where we act as an indirect carrier are reported based on the gross amount billed to the customer and include the charges for carrying the shipments 
based upon the terms in the contract of carriage  revenues are recognized at the time the freight is tendered to the direct carrier at origin 
costs related to the shipments are also recognized at this time 
as an authorized cargo sales agent of most airlines and ocean shipping lines  we also arrange for transportation of individual shipments and receive a commission from the airline or ocean shipping line for arranging the shipments 
when acting in this capacity  we do not consolidate shipments or have responsibility for shipments once they have been tendered to the carrier 
therefore  revenues include only the commissions and fees received 
these revenues are recognized upon completion of the services 
customs brokerage and other services 
customs brokerage and import services involve providing services at destinations  such as helping customers clear shipments through customs by preparing required documentation  calculating and providing for payment of duties and other taxes on behalf of the customers as well as arranging for any required inspections by governmental agencies and arranging for delivery 
we also offer a range of logistics services  distribution and materials management services  international insurance services  global project management services and trade facilitation services 
revenues include the fees received for these services and are recognized upon completion of the services 
allowance for doubtful accounts our allowance for doubtful accounts is determined using a combination of factors based on the expected ultimate recovery of trade receivables 
we maintain a bad debt reserve for all customers based on a variety of factors  including the length of time receivables are past due  general and specific economic trends  significant one time events and historical customer collection experience 
also  we record additional reserves for individual accounts when we become aware of a customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us  such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer s operating results or financial position 
trade receivables include disbursements made by us on behalf of our customers for transportation costs and customs duties 
as the billings to customers for these disbursements may be several times the amount of reve nues and fees derived from these transactions  the inability to collect such amounts could result in losses greater than the revenues recognized when such billings were recorded 
if circumstances related to customers change  our estimates of the allowance for doubtful accounts would be further adjusted 
computer software certain costs related to the development or purchase of internal use software are capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful life of the software 
costs related to the preliminary project stage  data conversion and the post implementation operation stage of a software development project are expensed as incurred 
on retirement or sale of assets  the cost of such assets and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and the gain or loss  if any  is credited or charged to income 
we have incurred substantial costs during the periods presented related to a number of information systems projects that were being developed over that time period 
inherent in the capitalization of those projects are the assumptions that after considering the technological and business issues related to their development  such development efforts will be successfully completed and that benefits to be provided by the completed projects will exceed the costs capitalized to develop the systems 
management believes that all projects capitalized at december  will be successfully completed and will result in benefits recoverable in future periods 
goodwill and other intangibles goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired 
goodwill is a residual amount and is determined after numerous estimates are made regarding the fair value of assets and liabilities included in a business combination  and therefore  indirectly affected by management s estimates and judgments 
we review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the provisions of sfas no 
require that a two step impairment test be performed on goodwill 
in the first step  we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value 
our reporting units are consistent with the geographic divisions identified in note of the consolidated financial statements in item we determine the fair value of our reporting units based on the present value of estimated future cash flows 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit  goodwill is not impaired and we are not required to perform further testing 
if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  then we must perform the second step in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill and compare it to the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then we must record an impairment loss equal to the difference 
the income approach  which we use to estimate the fair value of our reporting units is dependent on a number of factors including estimates of future market growth and trends  forecasted revenue  costs  cash flows and capital expenditures  and the timing thereof  appropriate discount rates  tax rates and other variables 
we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable  but which are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
actual future results may differ from those estimates 
in addition  we make certain assumptions to allocate shared assets  liabilities and overhead costs to calculate the carrying values for each of our reporting units 
impairment of assets substantial judgment is necessary in the determination as to whether an event or circumstance has occurred that may trigger an impairment analysis and in determination of the related cash flows from the asset 
estimating cash flows related to long lived assets is a difficult and subjective process that applies historical experience and future business expectations to revenues and related operating costs of assets 
should impairment appear to be necessary  subjective judgment must be applied to estimate the fair value of the asset  for which there may be no ready market  which oftentimes results in the use of discounted cash flow analysis and judgmental selection of discount rates to be used in the discounting process 
if we determine an asset has been impaired based on the projected undiscounted cash flows of the related asset or the business unit over the r emaining amortization period  and if the cash flow analysis indicates that the carrying amount of an asset exceeds related undiscounted cash flows  the carrying value is reduced to the estimated fair value of the asset or the present value of the expected future cash flows 
merger and restructuring we have engaged in merger and restructuring actions which require our management to utilize significant estimates related to future lease obligations for duplicate facilities  expenses for severance and other employee separation costs and costs for termination of joint venture agency agreements 
management makes significant estimates  including the amount of sublease income we will recover for future lease obligations on duplicate facilities 
should the actual amounts differ from our estimates  the amount of the restructuring charges could be materially impacted 
see note of the consolidated financial statements in item for a full description of our merger and restructuring actions 
taxes on earnings our effective tax rate includes the impact of certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no us taxes have been provided because such earnings are planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the united states 
material changes in our estimates of cash  working capital and long term investment requirements could impact our effective tax rate 
we recorded a valuation allowance to fully reserve our deferred tax assets generated from certain state and foreign net operating losses 
we considered our historical performance  forecasted taxable income and other factors in determining the sufficiency of our valuation allowance 
objective factors  such as current year and previous year net operating loss utilization  were give substantially more weight than management s outlook for future utilization 
management believes we should generate sufficient taxable income to utilize a substantial portion of our net operating loss carry forwards before their expiration 
however  until such time as a pattern of sufficient profitability in these jurisdictions for income tax purposes is established  we will not recognize tax benefits on net operating losses 
we also have deferred tax assets fo r certain foreign and other federal tax credits which management believes will be fully realized in the future based on current year utilization of foreign tax credits and management s outlook for future utilization 
in order to realize our deferred tax assets  we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in the specific tax jurisdictions to offset the deferred tax assets 
in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made 
if we later determine or are able to realize the deferred tax assets for the state or foreign net operating losses our valuation allowance could be reversed 
our federal income tax returns from fiscal years to are currently subject to audit by the internal revenue service 
management believes it has filed such returns in accordance with applicable tax laws in effect at the time 
however  there is no assurance that such audits will not result in future adjustments 
other critical accounting policies see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our critical accounting policies and the judgment made in their application 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our cash flows and net income are subject to fluctuations due to changes in exchange rates 
we attempt to limit our exposure to changing foreign exchange rates through operational actions 
we provide services to customers in locations throughout the world and  as a result  operate with many functional currencies including the key currencies of north america  latin america  asia  the south pacific and europe 
this diverse base of local currency costs serves to partially counterbalance the effect of potential changes in the value of our local currency denominated revenues and expenses 
short term exposures to changing foreign currency exchange rates are related primarily to intercompany transactions 
the duration of these exposures is minimized through the use of an intercompany netting and settlement system that settles the majority of intercompan y obligations two times per month 
we use short term foreign exchange forward contracts on a limited basis to minimize exposures to exchange rates on recorded receivables and payables
