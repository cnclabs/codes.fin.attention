item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction our revenues are earned from customer fees for cable television programming services including premium  digital and pay per view services and ancillary services  such as rental of converters and remote control devices  installations and from selling advertising 
in addition  we earn revenues from providing high speed internet and from facilitating the delivery of telephone services as well as from commissions for products sold through home shopping networks and management fees 
we have generated increases in revenues and operating cash flow for each of the past three fiscal years  primarily through a combination of acquisitions  internal customer growth  increases in monthly revenue per customer and growth in advertising and increasing new revenue from selling new services including high speed internet access and interactive digital video 
as a result of our march  purchase of the remaining equity interest in sourcesuite  llc  we now own of sourcesuite s equity interests 
as such  the operating results of sourcesuite have been consolidated in the accompanying financial statements effective january  during  we accounted for our interest in sourcesuite under the equity method 
we have historically recorded net losses through december  some of the principal reasons for these net losses include depreciation and amortization associated with our acquisitions and capital expenditures related to the construction and upgrading of our systems  and interest costs on borrowed money 
beginning january   we no longer record amortization expense associated with goodwill and franchise costs  however  we expect to continue to report net losses for the foreseeable future 
we cannot predict what impact  if any  continued losses will have on our ability to finance our operations in the future 
during the fourth quarter of  we determined that we had incorrectly accounted for the impact of minority interests related to our interest rate swap agreements which convert the interest on a portion of our variable rate senior credit facility to a fixed rate 
in addition  we had not reduced our deferred tax asset and related valuation allowance related to such swaps through other comprehensive income for subsequent changes in our deferred tax position 
we have therefore restated our financial statements for the year ended december  and have disclosed the impact of this restatement on the preceding quarters of and each of the four quarters of 
we have not restated our financial statements for the year ended december  since this correction does not have a material impact on them 
the restatement does not impact our revenue  operating income  operating cash flows or our loss before income taxes 

table of contents the following table is derived for the periods presented from our consolidated financial statements that are included in this report and sets forth certain statement of operations data for our consolidated operations 
certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year s presentation 
year ended december  restated in thousands revenue operating costs and expenses programming and other operating costs selling  general and administrative high speed internet charges depreciation and amortization total operating costs and expenses operating income loss operating cash flow interest expense income tax benefit minority interest income expense net loss net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities capital expenditures operating cash flow is a financial measure that is not calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
we define operating cash flow as operating income or loss before depreciation and amortization 
operating cash flow is useful to management in measuring the overall operational strength and performance of our company 
a limitation of this measure  however  is that it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating our revenues 
management evaluates the costs of such tangible and intangible assets through other financial measures such as capital expenditures and investment spending 
another limitation of operating cash flow is that it does not reflect income net of interest expense  which is a significant expense of our company because of the substantial debt we incurred to acquire our cable television systems and finance the capital expenditures for the upgrade of our cable network 
despite the limitations of operating cash flow  management believes that the presentation of this financial measure is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to evaluate our performance in a manner similar to the method used by management 
in addition  operating cash flow is commonly used in the cable television industry to analyze and compare cable television companies on the basis of operating performance  although our measure of operating cash flow may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other companies 
operating cash flow should not be regarded as an alternative to  or more meaningful than  either operating income or net income as an indicator of operating performance or cash flows as a measure of liquidity  as well as other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states

programming costs increased  primarily attributable to increased programming rates for our classic service  an increase in digital customers served  and additional programming in the newly rebuilt systems 
these increases were offset by a million credit from the settlement of a programming contract 
excluding the settlement of the programming contract  programming costs increased 
other operating costs increased  primarily attributable to increases in high speed internet costs driven by the net addition of  high speed internet customers  and  labor costs  which increased due to the transition from upgrade activities to maintenance activities

in addition  marketing expenses increased to support the continued roll out of new products 
legal fees also increased related to ongoing litigation 
partially offsetting these increases was an increase in marketing support funds recorded as a reduction to selling  general and administrative expenses for the promotion of new channel launches 
high speed internet service charges were incurred through february  as a result of payments made to home  the former provider of high speed internet services for all of our systems  except in ohio 
on september   home filed for protection under chapter of the bankruptcy code 
in order to continue providing service to existing customers and to resume the provisioning of service to new customers  we entered into an interim service arrangement that required us to pay million to home to extend service through february  as a result of this arrangement we incurred approximately million in excess of our original agreed to cost for such services rendered  of which million was incurred in depreciation and amortization expense increased million or primarily as a result of additional capital expenditures through december  to complete the rebuild of our illinois systems  extend our plant and continue the rollout of digital  high speed internet and telephone services to existing and new service areas 
excluding the write down of our obsolete video on demand equipment during the year ended december   depreciation and amortization increased million or 
operating cash flow increased million or primarily due to increased basic  digital and high speed internet revenue  partially offset by increases in programming and other operating costs and selling  general and administrative costs 
in addition  the increase in operating cash flow is also attributable to the absence of high speed internet service payments to home for the year ended december  that were previously included in the adjustments to operating cash flow during the year ended december  
table of contents interest expense remained relatively flat year over year 
the increase of million or is primarily due to the inclusion of million of accruals for preferred interests in accordance with sfas no 
 effective july  previously  the accrual was treated as a dividend below net income or loss 
additionally  the increase is related to higher outstanding debt  which averaged billion for the year ended december   versus billion for the year ended december  these increases were partially offset by a decrease in interest expense due to lower interest rates  which averaged for the year ended december   versus for the year ended december  minority interest decreased million or to expense of million from income of million 
the decrease is a direct result of the increase in net income attributable to common interests recorded by insight midwest primarily due to the million gain recorded on the swap of our griffin  georgia system for the managed shelbyville  kentucky and new albany  indiana systems owned by comcast of montana indiana kentucky ohio during the first quarter of  the million gain on the settlement of a programming contract and increased operating income partially offset by the million loss from the extinguishment of the coaxial debt  as discussed below

depreciation and amortization expense decreased million or to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily the result of ceasing the amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets associated with the adoption of sfas no 
 effective january  this was partially offset by an million write down of the carrying value of current video on demand equipment  which was replaced as of december  in connection with our transition to a new video on demand service provider

liquidity and capital resources our business requires cash for operations  debt service  capital expenditures and acquisitions 
the cable television business has substantial on going capital requirements for the construction  expansion and maintenance of its broadband networks 
expenditures have been made for various purposes including the 
table of contents upgrade of our existing cable network  and in the future will be used for network extensions  new services  converters and network upgrades 
historically  we have been able to meet our cash requirements with cash flow from operations  borrowings under our credit facilities and issuances of private and public debt and equity 
cash provided by operations for the years ended december  and was million and million 
the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in accrued expenses  accrued property taxes and deferred marketing revenue during the year ended december  partially offset by a decrease in accrued programming and the timing of cash receipts and payments related to the remaining working capital accounts 
cash used in investing activities for the years ended december  and was million and million 
the decrease was primarily attributable to reduced capital spending during the year ended december  due to the near completion of our system rebuilds offset by cash paid for the swap of our griffin  georgia system for the managed shelbyville  kentucky and new albany  indiana systems owned by comcast of montana indiana kentucky ohio and the purchase of the coaxial interests 
cash provided by used in financing activities for the years ended december  and was million and million 
the change was primarily due to the net impact of the retirement of the ohio obligations through the refinancing of insight midwest holding s credit facility and the issuance of an additional million principal amount at maturity senior notes 
for the years ended december  and  we spent million and million in capital expenditures largely to support our plant rebuild in illinois  which is substantially completed  telephone deployment and success based capital  including interactive digital and high speed internet expansion 
for the year ending december   it is anticipated that we will spend approximately million on capital expenditures 
we have concluded a number of financing transactions  which fully support our operating plan 
these transactions are detailed as follows on october   in connection with the formation of insight midwest and our acquisition of a interest in the kentucky systems  insight midwest completed an offering of million principal amount of its senior notes due the net proceeds of the offering were used to repay certain outstanding debt of the kentucky systems 
on november   insight midwest completed an offering of million principal amount of its senior notes due the net proceeds of the offering of million were used to repay a portion of the then existing indiana and kentucky credit facilities 
interest on the insight midwest senior notes is payable on april and october of each year and interest on the insight midwest senior notes is payable on may and november of each year 
the indentures relating to these senior notes impose certain limitations on the ability of insight midwest to  among other things  incur debt  make distributions  make investments and sell assets 
on december  insight midwest completed a million add on offering under the senior notes indenture 
insight midwest received proceeds of million  including million of interest accruing from october  through the date of issuance that was repaid to holders of the bonds in the first semi annual interest payment due on april   and net of an underwriting fee of million and a bond discount of million that is being amortized through october the proceeds of this offering were used to repay a portion of the outstanding revolving loans under the

on january   in conjunction with a series of transactions with cable subsidiaries of at t broadband now known as comcast cable  insight midwest holdings  llc  a subsidiary of insight midwest which serves as a holding company for all of insight midwest s systems  entered into a billion credit facility 
insight midwest holdings borrowed million to repay the then existing indiana and kentucky credit facilities and million to finance the at t broadband transactions 
the insight midwest holdings credit facility permits the distribution of cash from midwest holdings subsidiaries to enable insight midwest to pay interest on its senior notes and senior notes  so long as there exists no default under the credit facility 
the insight midwest holdings credit facility contains covenants restricting  among other things  the ability of midwest holdings and its subsidiaries to acquire or dispose of assets  make investments and engage in transactions with related parties 
the facility also requires compliance with certain financial ratios and contains customary events of default 
as of december   we were in compliance with the credit facility s covenant requirements 
given current operating conditions and projected results of operations  we anticipate continued compliance under this credit facility for the foreseeable future 
on march   we loaned million to insight midwest 
insight midwest holdings is permitted to make distributions to insight midwest for the purpose of repaying our loan provided that there are no defaults existing under the credit facility 
the loan to insight midwest bears annual interest of  compounded semi annually  has a scheduled maturity date of january  and permits prepayments 
on august  we amended the insight midwest holdings credit facility in connection with our plan to refinance all of the obligations and conditionally guaranteed obligations of insight ohio 
the amendment increased the term b loan portion of the credit facility from million to billion which increased the total facility size to billion from billion 
on august   insight midwest holdings distributed million to insight midwest which  in turn  contributed this amount to insight ohio 
simultaneously  insight ohio used these proceeds plus cash on hand to repay the then outstanding balance of the insight ohio credit facility of million plus accrued interest 
on september   insight midwest holdings used million of the insight midwest holdings credit facility to repay the outstanding principal  interest and call premiums related to the senior notes and senior discount notes issued by coaxial communications of central ohio  inc and its affiliates 
both series of notes had been conditionally guaranteed by insight ohio 
insight ohio is now a restricted subsidiary under the terms of our indentures 

table of contents on september   we purchased all the outstanding equity of the owners of coaxial  which held preferred interests of insight ohio and  shares of our stock  for million 
the purchase was financed through existing cash on hand 
in connection with the purchase  our then existing put obligation to the coaxial principals to purchase these shares was terminated 
in connection with these transactions  we retired the  shares of our stock held by coaxial and  immediately thereafter  contributed the purchased interests and insight midwest s interests in insight ohio to insight midwest holdings 
additionally  the series a and series b preferred interests of coaxial were converted to common interests 
on february   we completed an offering of million principal amount at maturity of senior discount notes due these notes were issued at a discount to their principal amount at maturity resulting in gross proceeds to us of approximately million 
we utilized approximately million of the proceeds to repay the outstanding amount of our inter company loan from insight midwest  which we incurred in connection with the financing of the at t transactions 
we intend to use the remaining proceeds for general corporate purposes  including joint ventures and or strategic acquisitions 
no cash interest on the discount notes will accrue prior to february  thereafter  cash interest on the discount notes will accrue and be payable on february and august of each year  commencing august  the initial accreted value of the discount notes of approximately million will increase until february  such that the accreted value will equal the principal amount on february  on december  we repurchased million face amount of the senior discount notes at the then accreted value of million for million  resulting in a gain of million  net of the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs of  as of december   the outstanding principal and accreted amounts of these notes were million and million 
we have a substantial amount of debt 
our high level of debt could have important consequences for you 
our investments in our operating subsidiaries  including insight midwest  constitute substantially all of our operating assets 
consequently  our subsidiaries conduct all of our consolidated operations and own substantially all of our operating assets 
our principal source of cash we need to pay our obligations and to repay the principal amount of our debt obligations is the cash that our subsidiaries generate from their operations and their borrowings 
our subsidiaries are not obligated to make funds available to us and are restricted by the terms of their indebtedness from doing so 
our ability to access the cash flow of our subsidiaries may be contingent upon our ability to refinance the debt of our subsidiaries 
we believe that the insight midwest holdings credit facility  cash on hand and our cash flow from operations are sufficient to support our current operating plan 
we have the ability to draw upon million of unused availability under the insight midwest holdings credit facility as of december  to fund any shortfall resulting from the inability of insight midwest s cash from operations to fund its capital expenditures  meet its debt service requirements or otherwise fund its operations

as of july   we had million of preferred interests recorded in our balance sheets as temporary equity 
these preferred interests were fully accreted to their maturity value of million as of august  and were subsequently converted to common interests in connection with our refinancing of the obligations of insight ohio 
in connection with the adoption of sfas no 
 for the three months ended september   we recorded a million accrual of preferred interests  which has been included in interest expense in our consolidated statements of operations

on october   the fasb announced that it had deferred indefinitely the application of sfas no 
as it applies to minority interests related to limited life entities consolidated in parent company financial statements 
although this application was deferred  the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
still apply and  therefore  companies are required to disclose the estimated settlement value of these non controlling interests 
if we were to adopt this aspect of the standard under its current provisions  it would be expected to have a material impact on our financial statements 
the insight midwest partnership was formed in september to serve as the holding company and a financing vehicle for our cable television system joint venture with an indirect subsidiary of at t broadband now known as comcast cable 
the results of the partnership are included in our consolidated financial statements since we as general partner effectively control insight midwest s operating and financial decisions 
the partnership will continue until october  unless terminated earlier in accordance with the provisions of the insight midwest partnership agreement 

table of contents depending on the nature of the dissolution  insight midwest will be required to either distribute to comcast cable some of its cable systems  to be determined in accordance with the partnership agreement  equal to of the net market value of the partnership or  upon liquidation  an amount in cash equal to of the net proceeds received 
as of december   we estimated the settlement value of these minority interests to be between million and billion 
this value was determined based on a per customer value ranging between  and  and after a reduction for outstanding debt and other liabilities of insight midwest 
critical accounting policies the methods  estimates and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our consolidated financial statements 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an on going basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
our experience and assumptions form the basis for our judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may vary from what we anticipate and different assumptions or estimates about the future could change our reported results 
we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical to us  in that they are important to the portrayal of our financial statements and they require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in purchase combinations the purchase combinations carried out by us require management to estimate the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the combinations 
these estimates of fair value are based on our business plan for the entities acquired including planned redundancies  restructuring  use of assets acquired and assumptions as to the ultimate resolution of obligations assumed for which no future benefit will be received 
we also utilize appraisal reports issued by independent appraisers 
should actual use of assets or resolution of obligations differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated fair values would be required 
if a change in estimate occurs after one year of the acquisition  the change would be recorded in our statement of operations 
goodwill and other identifiable intangibles we assess the impairment of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets annually and on an interim basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
some factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
when we determine that the carrying value of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangibles may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
with the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  on january  we 
table of contents ceased amortizing goodwill and franchise costs arising from acquisitions 
in lieu of amortization  we perform an annual impairment analysis 
if we determine through the impairment review process that goodwill has been impaired  we would record an impairment charge in our statement of operations 
investments periodically  we make strategic investments 
all marketable securities are classified as available for sale securities and are carried at fair value 
all other equity investments are carried at cost 
each quarter  we assess the value of these investments by using information acquired from industry trends  the management of these companies and other external sources 
based on the information acquired  we record an impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
fixed assets fixed assets include costs capitalized for labor and overhead incurred in connection with the installation of cable systems and is stated at cost 
depreciation for buildings  cable system equipment  furniture  fixtures and office equipment is calculated using the straight line method over estimated useful lives ranging from to years 
leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight line method over shorter of the remaining terms of the leases or the estimated lives of the improvements 

table of contents risk factors we have substantial debt and have significant interest payment requirements  which may adversely affect our ability to obtain financing in the future to finance our operations and our ability to react to changes in our business

the indentures governing insight midwest s outstanding senior notes and senior notes limit insight midwest s ability to distribute cash to us for any purpose 
furthermore  because we only own a equity interest in insight midwest  the insight midwest partnership agreement provides that insight midwest may not pay dividends or make other distributions to us without the consent of our partner  comcast cable 
as a result  even if the creditors of insight midwest and its subsidiaries were to permit distributions to us  comcast cable could prohibit any such distribution 
as a result  if we are unable to refinance the indebtedness of insight midwest and its subsidiaries on terms that provide insight midwest with a greater ability to provide us with funds prior to august   we may not be able to make payments required under the senior discount notes 
furthermore  borrowings under the insight midwest holdings credit facility are secured and will mature prior to our and insight midwest s outstanding notes 
accordingly  we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
the insight midwest holdings credit facility requires us to comply with various financial and operating restrictions which could limit our ability to compete as well as our ability to expand 
the insight midwest holdings credit facility contains covenants that restrict insight midwest holdings subsidiaries ability to distribute funds or pay dividends to insight midwest  incur additional indebtedness or issue additional equity  repurchase or redeem equity interests and indebtedness  pledge or sell assets or merge with another entity  create liens  and make certain capital expenditures  investments or acquisitions 

table of contents such restrictions could limit our ability to compete as well as our ability to expand 
the ability of insight midwest holdings subsidiaries to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond our control 
if they were to breach any of these covenants  they would be in default under the credit facility and they would be prohibited from making distributions to insight midwest 
we have a history of net losses  and may not be profitable in the future 
we have a history of net losses and expect to incur additional net losses in the future 
we incurred a net loss before accruals of preferred interests of million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december we have and will continue to have a substantial amount of interest expense in respect of debt incurred and depreciation and amortization expenses relating to acquisitions of cable systems as well as expansion and upgrade programs 
such expenses have contributed to the net losses we experienced 
we could face considerable business and financial risk in implementing our acquisition strategy 
as part of our strategy of pursuing value enhancing transactions  we intend to seek to swap or acquire systems that strategically fit our clustering and operating strategy 
although we regularly engage in discussions with respect to possible acquisitions and joint ventures  we do not currently have any understandings  commitments or agreements relating to any acquisitions 
future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities and an increase in amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets  which could have a material adverse effect upon our business  financial condition and results of operations 
risks we could face with respect to acquisitions include difficulties in the integration of the operations  technologies  products and personnel of the acquired company  risks of entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience  diversion of management s attention away from other business concerns  and expenses of any undisclosed or potential legal liabilities of the acquired company 
the risks associated with acquisitions could have a material adverse effect upon our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we cannot assure that we will be successful in consummating future acquisitions on favorable terms or at all 
our programming costs are substantial and they may increase  which could result in a decrease in profitability if we are unable to pass that increase on to our customers 
in recent years the cable industry has experienced a rapid escalation in the cost of programming  and sports programming in particular 
for through  programming costs increased significantly 
our cable programming services are dependent upon our ability to procure programming that is attractive to our customers at reasonable rates 
programming costs may continue to escalate and we may not be able to pass programming cost increases on to our customers 
our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected by further increases in programming costs 
programming has been and is expected to continue to be our largest single expense item and accounted for approximately of the total programming and other operating costs and selling  general and administrative expenses for our systems for the year ended december  
table of contents we are uncertain whether comcast s acquisition of at t s broadband business will have an adverse effect on our future financial and operating results  and whether it will affect our telephone services contract or programming costs 
until november  insight midwest was owned by us  as general partner  and by an indirect subsidiary of at t broadband  as limited partner 
at t broadband was a fully integrated business unit of at t corp 
as a result of comcast s acquisition of at t broadband on november   a new senior management team comprised principally of individuals that prior to the transaction operated the comcast cable properties will exercise significant control over decisions relating to insight midwest s limited partner 
insight midwest s partnership agreement prohibits it from taking certain actions without the approval of the limited partner 
accordingly  insight midwest will be dependent upon the discretion of its limited partner s new management in obtaining approval for certain significant transactions 
our long term agreement with comcast cable to facilitate the delivery of local telephone services uses switching and transport facilities obtained through comcast cable and our local network infrastructure  on which comcast cable leases capacity for a fee 
subsidiaries of comcast cable are the regulated telephone providers of the telephone services that we market to our customers 
comcast cable is evaluating its telephony strategy on an ongoing basis 
we are unable to predict whether any changes in comcast cables telephony strategy will affect our contractual relationship for the provision of telephone services 
furthermore  there can be no assurance comcast cable will continue to carry out its obligations under our telephone agreement  whether with respect to existing or future deployments 
all of our existing deployments of telephone services are marketed under the at t digital phone brand 
following comcast s acquisition of the broadband business of at t corp  the continued licensing to us of the at t digital phone brand is uncertain 
we are unable to predict whether the inability to market telephone services using the at t digital phone brand would have an adverse effect on the future results of our telephone operations 
we have relied in the past on our contractual arrangements with affiliates of at t broadband for the purchase of certain programming services for our systems at what we believe are attractive rates 
as a result of comcast s acquisition of at t broadband  comcast and at t broadband in many cases have long term agreements  in some cases with the same counterparties  for the same services and products  such as programming 
in the cases where there are separate agreements with the same counterparties  comcast is presently evaluating whether such agreements apply only to the operations to which they have historically applied or whether instead one of the two contracts will apply to the operations of both companies and the other contract will be terminated 
we are unable to determine whether such matters will have an adverse effect on our programming costs 
the competition we face from other cable networks and alternative service providers may cause us to lose market share 
the impact from competition  particularly from direct broadcast satellite television systems and companies that overbuild in our market areas  has resulted in a decrease in customer growth rates as well as a loss of subscribers 
the industry growth rate for basic customers for the years ended december and was a decrease of 
and an increase of respectively  while satellite penetration as of december averaged nationwide  up from in december this in turn has negatively impacted our financial performance 
increased competition may continue to impact our financial performance 
many of our potential competitors have substantially greater resources than we do  and we cannot predict the market share our competitors will eventually achieve  nor can we predict their ability to develop products which will compete with our planned new and enhanced products and services such as high speed internet access  video on demand and telephone services 

table of contents direct broadcast satellite service consists of television programming transmitted via high powered satellites to individual homes  each served by a small satellite dish 
legislation permitting direct broadcast satellite operators to transmit local broadcast signals was enacted on november  this eliminates a significant competitive advantage that cable system operators have had over direct broadcast satellite operators 
direct broadcast satellite operators have begun delivering local broadcast signals in the largest markets and there are plans to expand such carriage to many more markets over the next year 
while this authority is due to expire on december   extension legislation has been introduced in congress 
since our cable systems are operated under non exclusive franchises  competing operators of cable systems and other potential competitors  such as municipalities and municipal utility providers  may be granted franchises to build cable systems in markets where we hold franchises 
competition in geographic areas where a secondary franchise is obtained and a cable network is constructed is called overbuilding 
as of december   approximately of the homes passed by our cable systems were overbuilt 
also as of december   an affiliate of vectren corporation formerly southern indiana gas and electric co 
had overbuilt our evansville  indiana system and passes approximately  homes also passed by us 
in addition  knology  inc has obtained a franchise to provide cable television service in the city of louisville  kentucky  where we operate a system  although they have not constructed a cable system 
in addition  as of december   wideopenwest had overbuilt our columbus  ohio system and passed approximately  homes also passed by us 
in our illinois system  the city of springfield is considering a municipal overbuild 
we cannot predict what effect competition from these or future competitors will have on our business and operations 
we will face competition from providers of alternatives to our internet and telephone services 
several telephone companies are introducing digital subscriber line technology also known as dsl  which allows internet access over traditional phone lines at data transmission speeds greater than those available by a standard telephone modem 
although these transmission speeds are not as great as the transmission speeds of a cable modem  we believe that the transmission speeds of digital subscriber line technology are sufficiently high that such technology will compete with cable modem technology 
we cannot predict the impact dsl technology will have on our internet access services or on our operations 
as we expand our offerings to include telephone services  the telephone services we deliver will be subject to competition from existing providers  including both local exchange telephone companies and long distance carriers 
we cannot predict the extent to which the presence of these competitors will influence customer penetration in our telephone service areas 
we expect that the most significant competitors for our internet access and telephone service offerings will be the existing local exchange telephone companies as well as resellers using the local exchange telephone companies networks 
these competitors are currently the predominant providers of internet and telephone services in our markets 
we may be required to provide access to our networks to other internet service providers  which could significantly increase our competition and adversely affect our ability to provide new products and services 
the us congress and the federal communications commission have been asked to require cable operators to provide access over their cable systems to other internet service providers 
if we are required to provide forced access  it could prohibit us from entering into or limit our existing agreements with internet service providers  adversely impact our anticipated revenues from high speed internet access services and complicate marketing and technical issues associated with the introduction of these services 
to date  the us congress and the federal communications commission have declined to impose these requirements although the fcc has recently issued a notice of proposed rulemaking on this matter 
this 
table of contents same forced access issue is also being considered by some local franchising authorities and several courts 
based on a finding that it was bound by an earlier decision  the ninth circuit court of appeals overturned the fcc s classification and found cable internet service to include both information service and telecommunications service components 
although the ninth circuit s decision is under appeal  if upheld this decision could increase the risk of forced access obligations 
franchise renewals and transfers could also become more difficult depending upon the outcome of this issue 
our business has been and continues to be subject to extensive governmental legislation and regulation  and changes in this legislation and regulation could increase our costs of compliance and reduce the profitability of our business 
the cable television industry is subject to extensive legislation and regulation at the federal and local levels  and  in some instances  at the state level  and many aspects of such regulation are currently the subject of judicial proceedings and administrative or legislative proposals 
operating in a regulated industry increases the cost of doing business generally 
we may also become subject to additional regulatory burdens and related increased costs 
as we continue to introduce additional communications services  we may be required to obtain federal  state and local licenses or other authorizations to offer such services 
we may not be able to obtain such licenses or authorizations in a timely manner  or at all  or conditions could be imposed upon such licenses and authorizations that may not be favorable to us 
members of management  as major stockholders  possess unequal voting rights resulting in the ability to control all major corporate decisions  and other stockholders may be unable to influence these corporate decisions 
we have two classes of common stock class a which carries one vote per share and class b which carries ten votes per share 
our directors  executive officers  members of management and family members own all of the outstanding class b common stock 
as a result of their stock ownership  such holders of class b common stock will have the power to elect all of our directors and control stockholder decisions on other matters such as amendments to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  and mergers or other fundamental corporate transactions 
the interests of our controlling stockholders  including our management  may conflict with the interests of the other holders of class a common stock 
the disproportionate voting rights of the class a common stock relative to the class b common stock may make us a less attractive target for a takeover than we otherwise might be or render more difficult or discourage a merger proposal or a tender offer 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our revolving credit and term loan agreements bear interest at floating rates 
accordingly  we are exposed to potential losses related to changes in interest rates 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
in order to manage our exposure to interest rate risk  we enter into derivative financial instruments  typically interest rate swaps and collars 
the counter parties to our swap and collar agreements are major financial institutions 
as of december   million of our interest rate swap and collar agreements expire in august  million expire in november and million expire in november the fair market value and carrying value of our senior notes  senior notes and senior discount notes was billion and billion as of december  additionally  the fair market value of our credit facility borrowings approximate their carrying values as the credit facility borrowings bear interest at floating rates of interest 
as of december   the estimated fair value cost if terminated of our interest rate swap and collar agreements was approximately million  which represents the amount required to enter into offsetting contracts with similar remaining maturities based on quoted market prices and is reflected in our financial statements as other non current liabilities 
changes in the 
table of contents fair value of derivative financial instruments are either recognized in income or in stockholders equity as a component of other comprehensive loss depending on whether the derivative financial instruments qualify for hedge accounting 
as of december   we had entered into interest rate swaps that approximated million  or  of our borrowings under all of our credit facilities 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would increase our annual interest expense by approximately million
