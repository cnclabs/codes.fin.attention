overview we are a digital marketing services and technology company that helps marketers acquire  retain  and grow customers across digital media 
we are organized into two lines of business  digital marketing services  including our avenue a and i frontier advertising agencies  and digital marketing technologies  through atlas dmt 
through our interactive advertising agencies  avenue a and i frontier  we offer advertisers a suite of services that enable those advertisers to increase the effectiveness and return on investment of their internet advertising campaigns 
our agency core services include media planning and buying  ad serving  campaign analysis  optimization  and creative and web site development 
in addition  we offer our clients services such as customer insights  customer targeting  e mail  search engine marketing  portal relationship management and products such as brandoptics  global marketing dashboard  channelscope and selector

in addition  through our go toast service offerings  we provide our clients paid search management and optimization tools to improve their search engine marketing efforts 
we also provide our clients with the ability to manage their web sites effectiveness with our atlas vital signs and atlas netconversions tools 
after a period of disappointing growth  according to jupiter research  the internet advertising industry grew approximately in the growth in is primarily a result of increased spending from traditional 
table of contents advertisers as companies began to understand the effectiveness of online media and increased their online budgets accordingly 
industry highlights for include the resurgence of the major internet portals  such as yahoo and msn  due to the reach and impact of a homepage placement on these portals 
the portals and other search engine sites also expanded their offering of pay per click search advertising as a result of advertisers increased demand for effective search management technologies 
the industry also saw an increased use of rich media advertising due to advances in technology 
in addition  there was a renewed interest in customer targeting technologies and services 
the industry also experienced additional pressures on the pricing of ad serving as large advertisers called for more competitive prices for ad serving 
these pricing pressures are expected to continue into as evidence of the growth in the industry  we experienced a increase in revenue in compared to and generated the first fiscal year of profitability in our history 
throughout  avenue a revised its contractual agreements with clients and online publishers so that effective january   avenue a s clients will be directly liable for the cost of media purchases pursuant to those contractual agreements 
as a result  we will begin recording revenue generated under such contractual agreements on a net basis  which excludes the cost of media purchased for our clients 
historical net revenue as if recorded on a net basis increased in from see further discussion of our results for in the results of operations section beginning on page digital marketing services our digital marketing services line of business experienced significant growth in resulting in revenues of million  compared to million in in november  through the acquisition of i frontier  we acquired creative and web site development capabilities and during  we were able to cross sell these capabilities to a number of avenue a clients 
in addition  as evidence of our continued emphasis on measurability  avenue a introduced channelscope  which enables multi channel marketers to quantify the offline sales impact of online advertising campaigns through anonymously associating online advertising to offline transactions 
in july  avenue a announced the loss of a client that has historically been one of our five largest revenue generating clients 
although the loss of the client was significant  our digital marketing services line of business saw significant increases in spending from existing clients and the addition of new clients 
during the quarter ended december  we had clients who generated revenue compared to during the quarter ended december  with the addition of new clients  we experienced an increase in client support expenses necessary to support these new clients 
digital marketing technologies our digital marketing technologies line of business increased revenues to million in from million in through the addition of a net new clients located both domestically and internationally  including canada  the united kingdom and australia  resulting in clients as of december  atlas dmt released three new versions of its atlas digital marketing suite which included product enhancements to help agencies improve the efficiency of their online advertising campaigns and innovations  such as rich media interaction reporting through a new metric called brand exposure duration  which measures the length of time an individual is exposed to a given advertisement 
in december  we announced the acquisition of go toast  a provider of search engine optimization tools 
with the new client additions and advances in technology  we experienced increased client support and sales and marketing expenses 
in addition  our technology advances required additional investments in product development  of which certain direct costs are capitalized in accordance with the guidance outlined in statement of position accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
critical accounting policies and judgments the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  
table of contents revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
the sec has defined a company s most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations  and that require management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
based on this definition  we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below 
although we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable  they are based upon information presently available 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition and presentation gross versus net revenue presentation the majority of our revenue in  and has been recognized on a gross basis in accordance with the final consensus reached by the emerging issues task force eitf in july on eitf  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
revenue generated under gross method contracts  which consists of the gross value of our billings to our clients  includes the price of the advertising space that we purchase from web sites to resell to our clients 
to generate revenue under these contracts  we purchase advertising space from publisher web sites and sell the purchased space to our clients and are ultimately responsible for payment to web sites for the cost of space we purchase 
we also recognize revenue for certain contracts with clients under the net method 
to generate revenue under net method contracts  we buy advertising space from publisher web sites on behalf of our clients and earn fees based on the dollar amount of advertising space we purchase 
in addition  we earn fees based on hours spent managing our clients media purchases 
under net method contracts  our clients are primarily responsible for payment to the publisher web sites for the cost of the advertising space purchased 
all such revenue  including revenue from our core services and our customer targeting program  is recognized over the period that the related advertising is delivered or services are provided 
during  we revised contractual agreements with clients and online publishers so that effective january   avenue a s clients will be directly liable for the cost of media purchases pursuant to those contractual agreements 
accordingly  effective january   we generate substantially all revenue under net method contracts 
we believe that these net method contracts are consistent with the type of contracts that most advertising agencies use and better facilitate financial comparisons with competitors in our industry 
we also believe that this change in contracts standardizes contractual terms and revenue presentation among our interactive advertising agency operating units  reduces certain state and local taxes and mitigates certain other business obligations and risks 

table of contents the tables below provide a reconciliation of revenue as reported to net revenue  which excludes the cost of media purchased for our avenue a clients 
we have presented net revenue to provide additional information that will facilitate comparisons with our industry competitors and allow for better comparability with our results beginning in year ended december  in thousands revenue  as reported less cost of media purchases net revenue three months ended december september june march in thousands revenue  as reported less cost of media purchases net revenue revenue  as reported less cost of media purchases net revenue revenue  as reported less cost of media purchases net revenue revenue recognition for our services and products in general  the company follows the guidance in staff accounting bulletin and considers the nature of products and services delivered to the customers relative to the fair values of the services involved and other factors in determining revenue recognition

revenue from the volume based service is generally recognized when impressions are delivered and revenue from the subscription based service is recognized ratably over the service period 
revenue is generally recognized for customer insights  channelscope and brandoptics services under a proportional performance method of accounting 
it is our policy to recognize any loss on services as soon as management estimates indicate a loss will occur

accounting for acquisitions in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations sfas no 
 which addresses financial accounting and reporting for business combinations 
in connection with our acquisition of i frontier in november and go toast in december we allocated the cost of the acquisitions to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at date of acquisition in accordance with sfas no 
as a result  the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired was allocated to the following in thousands i frontier go toast non compete agreement customer relationships developed technology goodwill significant judgment is required to estimate the fair value of intangible assets at the date of acquisition  including estimating future cash flows from the acquired business  determining appropriate discount rates  asset lives  and other assumptions 
our process to determine the fair value of the non compete agreements  customer relationships  and developed technology includes the use of estimates including the potential impact on operating results if the non compete agreements were not in place  revenue estimates for customers acquired through the acquisition based on an assumed customer attrition rate  estimated costs willing to be incurred to purchase the capabilities gained through the developed technology  and appropriate discount rates based on the particular business s weighted average cost of capital 
our estimates of an entity s growth and costs are based on historical data  various internal estimates and a variety of external sources  and are developed as part of our routine long range planning process 
accounting for goodwill goodwill is initially recorded when the purchase price paid for an acquisition exceeds the estimated fair value of the net identified tangible and intangible assets acquired 
we perform an annual review in the fourth quarter of each year  or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist  to determine if the recorded goodwill is impaired 
our impairment review process compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value  including the goodwill related to the reporting unit 
to determine the fair value  our review process uses the income method and is based on a discounted future cash flow approach that uses estimates including the following for the reporting units revenue based on assumed market segment growth rates  estimated costs  and appropriate discount rates based on the particular business s weighted average cost of capital 
our estimates of market segment growth and costs are based on historical data  various internal estimates and a variety of external sources  and are developed as part of our routine long range planning process 
in addition to being used in our goodwill impairment analysis  the same estimates are used in the planning for both our long term and short term business planning and forecasting 
we test the reasonableness of the inputs and outcomes of our discounted cash flow analysis by comparison to available and comparable market data 
during the fourth quarter of  we completed our most recent review which did not result in the recording of an impairment charge 
we may incur charges for the impairment of goodwill in the future if the business segment fails to achieve our assumed revenue growth rates or assumed operating margin results 

table of contents the i frontier purchase agreement includes future contingent payments in and  which will be determined based upon the operating results of i frontier through december  any contingent payments will be recorded as goodwill 
the calculation of the contingent payments is based upon a combination of a multiple of earnings through december  and an amount equal to the value of net assets at the date of acquisition 
the agreement includes the potential for an interim payment based upon i frontier earnings during the two years ending december   which is partially refundable based upon i frontier earnings during the four years ending december  the go toast purchase agreement includes future contingent payments in and  which will be determined based upon the actual revenue results of go toast through december  any contingent payments will be recorded as goodwill 
accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
the determination of taxes payable for the current year includes estimates 
in the event that actual results differ materially from management s expectations  the estimated taxes payable could materially change  directly impacting our financial position or results of operations 
we have provided full valuation allowances on net deferred tax assets 
due to our history of operating losses  we have determined it is more likely than not they will not be fully realized 
we achieved our first year of profitability in continued profitability could lead to a reduction of the net deferred tax asset valuation allowance in future periods 
if this occurs it would favorably impact net income 
estimates and assumptions related to financial statements the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our audited consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those affecting revenues  the allowance for doubtful accounts  intangible assets  goodwill  state  local and federal income taxes and general business contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form our basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
washington state tax authorities issued a ruling in that permits us to exclude amounts paid by us to purchase media for clients  which is ultimately billed to and paid for by clients  from the measure of washington state business and occupation tax 
we received reporting instructions from washington state tax authorities that disallow this exclusion in periods beginning in february and thereafter 
we are considering alternatives to mitigate the resulting adverse tax consequences  including evaluation of tax alternatives that might allow deduction of media purchases in connection with the measure of business and occupation tax and assertion of administrative remedies in accordance with washington state tax regulations 
the company has been selected by the city of seattle for a routine business and occupation tax audit 
the period under audit is january  through september  the audit has not been completed 
in managements judgment  the company has complied with the seattle municipal tax code 
the tax audit could result in findings that materially change taxes payable  directly impacting our financial position or results of operations 

table of contents results of operations the following table presents  in dollars and as a percentage of revenue  statements of operations data for the years ended december   and our discussion of revenue and cost of revenue that follows provides a reconciliation of revenue and cost of revenue as reported and revenue and cost of revenue as if cost of media purchases were excluded net revenue 
we believe the net revenue analysis facilitates a better comparison of our digital marketing services against other companies in our industry  since many of these companies also exclude the cost of media from reported revenue 
furthermore  due to the prospective contractual changes discussed previously  we believe this measure will enhance comparability in future periods 
the results of any period are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period

in  atlas dmt completed its first full year as a stand alone operating unit and in atlas dmt released three new versions of its atlas digital marketing suite that included several product enhancements and innovations

in general  we have been successful in renegotiating lower pricing with our bandwidth providers  resulting in a decrease in bandwidth costs at a per advertisement level in and the decrease in pricing has been partially offset by the increase in volume of advertisements served for our clients 
the cost of services associated with such services as survey delivery  search engine optimization and email delivery  purchased for our clients is largely dependent on the timing of their use in a specific client campaign

 we reclassified all previously recorded intangible assets as goodwill  as those assets  related to workforce and customer base  did not meet the criteria under sfas no 
for separate identification 
furthermore  as a result of the impairment test  we recorded an impairment charge of million that has been recognized as a cumulative effect on prior years of a change in accounting principle in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources since our inception  we have financed our operations primarily through the net proceeds from private sales of equity securities  which raised million through december   and our initial public offering of common stock  which raised million during the first quarter of during the quarter ended december   we generated our first net income 
in and  we generated and million  respectively  in cash and cash equivalents through our operating  investing and financing activities 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and short term investments of million 
as of december   we had no outstanding debt 
net cash from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was and million in and  respectively  and net cash used in operating activities was million in our net cash provided by or used in operating activities is primarily a result of our net income loss adjusted by the timing of cash collections from our clients and the subsequent cash payments for purchases of media on behalf of our clients 
under our prior avenue a contract structure in  we were liable for media purchases for our clients and the payment of publisher invoices was not dependent on receipt of payment from our clients 
as such  the cash generated from operating activities could be significantly influenced by the timing of payments received from clients and payment to publisher web sites 
effective january   under our new contract structure  avenue a s clients are directly liable for media purchases and we are not legally required to pay publisher invoices without previous payment from our client for that media purchase 
we believe this change may influence our cash flow from operating activities as the timing of payments for media purchases will now be influenced by the timing of payment received by our clients for such media purchases 
in addition  as of december   of our accounts receivable balance related to three customers 
as such  the timing of payments received from these customers can also materially influence our cash flow from operations at any point in time 
although our cash flow from operating activities is influenced primarily by the timing of media payments and our client concentration  the cash received from our clients for our services exceeds the funds necessary to maintain current operations 
net cash from investing activities our investing activities primarily relate to the purchase and sale of short term investments  capital expenditures  and acquisition related activities

proceeds from the issuance of common stock and exercises of common stock options was million   and  in   and respectively 
the increases were primarily attributable to increases in our stock price  which led to more stock option exercises 
in april  we announced that our board of directors had authorized a stock repurchase program under which up to million of our common stock could be repurchased from time to time with available funds 
the primary purpose of the stock repurchase program is to allow us the flexibility to repurchase our common stock to potentially reduce stock dilution and seek to improve our long term earnings per share 
repurchases may be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions  subject to regulatory considerations  and may be discontinued at any time 
during the year ended december   we repurchased  shares of common stock for approximately million 
during the year ended december   we did not purchase any common stock under this program 
although the stock repurchase program remains in place  we do not currently intend to make a material amount of repurchases  if any  under the present circumstances 
future repurchases  if any  will depend on subsequent developments  corporate needs and market conditions 
if subsequent developments occur or corporate needs and market conditions change that might cause us to make one or more repurchases  we would not necessarily make a public announcement about it at that time

we cannot assure you that actual future payments will not be materially different than our current estimates

since our inception  we have significantly increased our operating expenses 
due to the estimated increase in revenue in  we currently anticipate that we will continue to experience some growth in our operating expenses and such expenses will be a material use of our cash resources

recent accounting pronouncements the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities vie  in january and amended it in december fin addresses how a business enterprise should evaluate whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity through means other than voting rights and accordingly should consolidate the entity 
the provisions of fin were effective immediately for all arrangements entered into with new vies created after january  and we have elected to apply the remaining provisions of fin for the period ending december  we have completed a review of our investments in both non marketable and marketable securities as well as other arrangements to determine whether we are the primary beneficiary of any vies 
the review did not identify any vies that would require consolidation or any significant exposure to vies that would require disclosure item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk is limited to interest income sensitivity  which is affected by changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly because the majority of our investments are in short term  
table of contents investment grade debt securities issued by corporations and us government bonds 
we place our investments with high quality issuers and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
due to the nature of our short term investments  we believe that we are not subject to any material market risk exposure 
we do not have any foreign currency or other derivative financial instruments
