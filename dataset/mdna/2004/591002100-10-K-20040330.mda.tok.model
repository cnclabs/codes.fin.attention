however  certain of our accounting policies are particularly important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and may require the application of significant judgment by our management  as a result they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
in applying those policies  our management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates 
those estimates are based on our historical experience  our observance of trends in the industry  information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
our significant accounting policies include revenue recognition revenues from our advisory services are recognized on a straight line basis over the subscription contract period  generally one year 
all subscription contracts are billable at signing  absent special terms granted on a limited basis from time to time 
as such  our policy is to record at the time of signing of an advisory services subscription contract the fees receivable and related deferred revenues for the full amount of the subscription contract 
accounts receivable and deferred revenues that extend beyond a month period have been classified on the consolidated balance sheets as non current 
we also record the related sales commission obligation upon the signing of the subscription contract and amortize the corresponding deferred commission expense over the subscription period in which the related advisory services revenues are earned and amortized to income 
we recognize revenue on strategic consulting engagements on a contract by contract basis  as the work is performed  utilizing the percentage of completion method for fixed fee projects  or as services are rendered for time and materials projects 
the average duration of our consulting engagements is months 
revenues from published research products are recognized at the time the applicable product is delivered

deferred tax valuation allowance during  we recorded a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets as a result of our losses over our recent history 
we considered future taxable income versus the cumulative losses incurred during the previous three years and determined that  in light of the cumulative losses over our recent history  we could not support a conclusion that realization of the existing deferred tax assets was more likely than not

sfas provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas amends the disclosure requirements of sfas to require more prominent and more frequent disclosures in financial statements about the effects of stock based compensation 
the transition guidance and annual disclosure provisions of sfas are effective for fiscal years ending after december  the interim disclosure provisions are effective for financial reports containing financial statements for interim periods beginning after december  the company currently does not intend to change its existing method of accounting for stock based employee compensation unless required by the issuance of a new pronouncement 
the company adopted the disclosure requirements of sfas as of december  in november  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  eitf 
eitf provides guidance on how to account for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services and rights to use assets 
the provisions of eitf apply to revenue arrangements entered into in the fiscal periods beginning after june  the company examined its current advisory service offerings and has determined that its present accounting policies are consistent with the guidance contained in eitf risk factors if we are unable to return to profitability it could impact our ability to continue our operations we experienced a net loss before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting of million for and million for to return to profitability  we will need to  among other things  achieve revenue growth and or maintain operating expenses below revenue levels 
if we fail to either achieve revenue growth and or maintain operating expenses below revenue levels  such a failure will likely result in continued operating and or net losses 
operating and net losses over sustained periods of time could impact our ability to continue our operations 
decreases and delays in it spending could lead to further decreases in our revenues and increase our net losses our business depends on continued spending on it by substantial commercial and governmental users of it 
if  as a result of general economic uncertainty or otherwise  it users continue to reduce it spending levels or delay their purchases of it products and services  then such decreases or delays in spending could continue to reduce demand for our products and services  which could lead to further decreases in our revenues and increase our net losses 
the company has seen reduced it spending levels from its customers beginning in the latter half of and continuing to the present 
additionally  we expect decreases and delays in it spending to continue to affect our business for the foreseeable future 
we may have to change our product pricing strategy due to competitive pressures our pricing strategy may limit the potential market for our advisory services  strategic consulting services and published research products to substantial commercial and governmental users and vendors of it 
pricing pressures have contributed to our decline in revenue as we have lost business to competitors offering similar products and services for a lesser price and  in certain circumstances  have lowered the selling price of certain of our products and services 
as a result  we may be required to change our pricing strategy by reducing prices for our existing advisory services  strategic consulting services and published research products or to introduce new products and services with lower prices to expand or maintain our market share 
these actions present risks because the new products might not be accepted by our customers and or our revenues could be reduced by lower prices 
we depend on renewals of subscription based services  and our failure to renew at historical rates could lead to further decreases in our revenues and increase our net losses we derived approximately and of our total revenues during and  respectively  from subscriptions to our advisory services 
advisory service subscriptions typically have a one year term 
we may not be successful in renewing the subscriptions of our customers at historical renewal rates 
our ability to renew subscriptions is subject to a number of risks  including the following we may be unsuccessful in delivering consistent  high quality  and timely analysis and advice to our clients we may not be able to hire or retain highly talented analysts in a very competitive job market we may be unsuccessful in understanding and anticipating market trends and the changing needs of our clients we may not be able to deliver products and services of the quality and timeliness necessary to withstand competition our clients may continue to shift their demands to more consultative  solution oriented products and services that take into account the client s unique environment if we are unable to successfully maintain our subscription renewal rates  our annual revenue may decrease 
we depend on non recurring strategic consulting engagements  and our failure to secure new engagements could lead to further decreases in our revenues and increase our net losses we derived approximately and of our total revenues during the years and from strategic consulting engagements 
strategic consulting engagements vary in number  size and scope  and typically are project based and non recurring 
our ability to replace completed strategic consulting engagements with new engagements is subject to a number of risks  including the following we may be unsuccessful in delivering consistent  high quality and timely consulting services to our clients we may not be able to hire or retain highly talented consultants in a very competitive job market we may not be able to develop new business we may not be able to maintain the costs of engagements within fixed fee arrangements we may be unsuccessful in understanding and anticipating market trends and the changing needs of our clients the skills and competencies of our strategic consulting staff may not match the skills required for the fulfillment of existing or potential strategic consulting engagements we may not be able to deliver consulting services of the quality and timeliness necessary to withstand competition if we are not able to replace completed strategic consulting engagements with new engagements  our revenue may decrease 
our results may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis which could affect the price of our common stock our operating results have varied significantly from quarter to quarter 
we expect future operating results to fluctuate due to several factors  many of which are not in our control  including the following the disproportionately large percentage of our advisory services subscriptions that expire in the fourth quarter of each year the level and timing of renewals of subscriptions to our advisory services the mix of advisory services revenues versus strategic consulting and published research products revenues the number  size and scope of strategic consulting engagements in which we are engaged  the degree of completion of such engagements and our ability to match the skills of our consulting staff to consulting engagement opportunities accuracy of estimates of resources required to complete ongoing strategic consulting engagements the timing and amount of new business generated by us the mix of domestic versus international business the performance of our acquired international subsidiaries the timing of the development  introduction  marketing and market acceptance of new products and services the timing of the hiring of research analysts  consultants  and sales representatives effective use of our analysts and consultants changes in the spending patterns of our clients our ability to collect our accounts and notes receivable changes in market demand for it research and analysis our ability to increase our sales to our existing customers and find new customers decreases in spending on it by substantial commercial and governmental users of it general economic uncertainty and economic slowdown in the us and abroad competitive conditions in the industry  including pricing pressure 
due to these factors  we believe that period to period comparisons of operating results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied on as an indication of future operating results 
the potential fluctuations in our operating results make it likely that  in some future quarter  our operating results will be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors  which could lower the price of our common stock 
our international operations expose us to a variety of risks which could negatively impact our future revenue growth and profitability net revenues attributable to international clients represented approximately and of our total advisory services revenues for and  respectively 
we sell our products and services internationally through a network of foreign subsidiaries and independent sales representative organizations 
we assume significantly greater risks by selling through independent sales representative organizations than through a direct employee sales force or foreign subsidiaries 
these risks include failure by us to find distributors for our products and services the financial health of each foreign subsidiary and individual sales representative organization the ability of individual sales representative organizations to repay their liabilities to us developing and managing relationships with sales representative organizations and their employees failure by us to replace sales representative agreements on terms beneficial to us or on a timely basis and clients potential unwillingness to continue to do business with us or our new distributor in the event that any existing agreements with independent sales representative organizations are terminated integration of acquired international operations into our existing operations greater difficulty in maintaining direct client contact greater accounts receivable collection risk to the extent we rely on the sales representative organization to invoice and collect receivables longer accounts receivable collection cycles 
in addition  our general risks of international operations include political  social  legal and economic conditions in various jurisdictions 
specifically  some countries in which we operate may experience political or social turmoil and adverse economic conditions and have adopted significant  and sometimes restrictive  political and legal policies  measures and regulatory requirements affecting commerce 
these events and laws could  among other things  affect a country s currency controls  cause fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates or result in financial difficulties for our international clients 
these effects could  in turn  increase the costs of our products and services or cause some of our international clients to reduce their purchases of our products and services 
in addition  effective intellectual property protection may not be available in all jurisdictions in which we offer or intend to offer our products and services tariffs and other trade barriers potentially adverse tax consequences 
we expect that international operations will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues and we intend to continue to expand our international operations 
expansion into new geographic territories may require considerable management and financial resources  as was the case during the three years ended december   and may negatively impact our results of operations 
if we are unable to successfully manage the risks associated with international operations  such an inability could reduce our total revenues and profitability 
we may fail to anticipate and adapt to market changes which could impair our ability to remain competitive and harm our market share our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate rapidly changing technologies and market trends  and to adapt our products and services to meet the changing information and analysis needs of it users 
frequent and often dramatic changes characterize the it industry  including the following introduction of new products and obsolescence of others shifting strategies and market positions of major industry participants paradigm shifts with respect to system architectures changing objectives and expectations of it users and vendors volatility in spending levels on it by substantial commercial and governmental users of it 
this environment of rapid and continuous change presents significant challenges to our ability to provide our clients with current and timely analysis and advice on issues of importance to them 
we commit substantial resources to meeting these challenges 
if we fail to provide insightful timely analysis of developments and assessment of technologies and trends in a manner that meets changing market needs  we may lose our customers to competitors who may better anticipate changing technologies and market trends and provide more timely analysis and advice 
we may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel which could jeopardize the quality of our research  product development  selling  marketing and management we need to hire  train and retain qualified employees to execute our strategy and support growth 
in particular  we need trained research analysts  consultants  sales representatives  product development staff  operations staff and management 
we continue to experience intense competition in recruiting and retaining qualified employees 
the pool of experienced candidates is small  and we compete for qualified employees against many companies  including gartner  inc  that have substantially greater financial resources than we do 
if we are unable to successfully hire  retain and motivate a sufficient number of qualified employees  the quality of our research  our product development efforts  our selling  marketing and management could each be negatively impacted  which could have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we have many competitors who may be more effective than us which could result in pricing pressure and loss of market share the it research  analysis and consulting industry is extremely competitive 
we compete directly with other independent providers of similar services and indirectly with the internal staffs of current and prospective client organizations 
our principal direct competitor  gartner  inc  has a substantially longer operating history and has considerably greater financial resources and market share than we do 
we also compete indirectly with larger electronic and print media companies and consulting firms 
our indirect competitors  many of which have substantially greater financial  information gathering and marketing resources than we do  could choose to compete directly against us in the future 
our market has few barriers to entry 
new competitors could easily compete against us in one or more market segments addressed by our advisory services or strategic consulting services 
our current and future competitors may develop products and services that are more effective than our products and services 
competitors may also produce their products and services at less cost and market them more effectively 
if we are unable to successfully compete against existing or new competitors  such an inability will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and would likely result in pricing pressure and loss of market share 
we may not be able to develop or acquire the new products and services that we need to remain competitive our future success depends on our ability to develop or acquire new products and services that address specific industry and business sectors  changes in client requirements and technological changes in the it industry 
the process of internally researching  developing  launching and gaining client acceptance of a new product or service is inherently risky and costly 
assimilating and marketing an acquired product or service is also risky and costly 
in addition  we have introduced few new products or services and have had limited experience in acquiring and integrating new products or services into our business 
if we are unable to develop new products and services  we may lose customers to competitors who may better provide updated products and services  which could lead to a decrease in revenues and a loss of market share 
our strategic investments expose us to financial risks which could result in additional impairment losses in an effort to develop new products and services  from april to december  we made investments in and advances to companies in parallel or synergistic industries totaling approximately million 
such strategic investments and advances are highly risky and illiquid 
during  and  we determined that  based on reviews of the business climate of each company in which we had an investment  that company s historical financial results  projected cash flow  plans for the future and likelihood of achieving such plans and other available market data  several of our investments in these companies were impaired 
accordingly  we recorded  million and million of impairment losses  respectively  on these investments 
there can be no assurance that such strategic investments will result in new product or service offerings for us or otherwise be successful 
many factors outside our control  including general economic conditions  could impair the value of our strategic investments requiring us to record further  substantial losses related to such investments 
moreover  these strategic investments may disrupt our ongoing business and distract management 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that we will be able to liquidate our strategic investments when needed or desirable 
if we are unable to manage our remaining strategic investments  we may not be able to obtain any developments in new products and services we wanted to obtain and we may be required to record further impairment losses 
if we fail to integrate recent acquisitions  we may not realize the benefits expected from our investments as part of our business strategy  we buy  or make investments in  complementary businesses  products and services 
if we find a business that we wish to acquire  we may have difficulty negotiating the terms of the purchase  financing the purchase  and assimilating the employees  products and operations of the acquired business 
acquisitions may disrupt our ongoing business and distract our management 
furthermore  acquisitions of new businesses may not lead to the successful development of new products or services  or if developed  such products or services may not achieve market acceptance or prove to be profitable 
we may therefore pay more than the value we derive from the acquisition 
a given acquisition may also have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  we may be required to incur debt or issue equity to pay for any future acquisitions or contingent payments in connection with previously consummated acquisitions  which may be dilutive to our current stockholders and or decrease our working capital 
our stock price is volatile which could result in investors losing some or all of their investment the market price of our common stock has been volatile 
during  as reported on the nasdaq national market  our common stock quotations ranged from a high of to a low of 
in  the market price of our common stock reached a low of and a high of 
in  the market price of our common stock reached a low of and a high of 
in  the market price of our common stock reached a low of and a high of 
the market price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to our perceived prospects  including anticipated revenue growth variations in our operating results and our achievement of key business targets our ability to maintain operating expenses below revenue levels changes in securities analysts recommendations or earnings estimates differences between our reported results and those expected by investors and securities analysts announcements of new service offerings by us or our competitors market reaction to any acquisitions  joint ventures or strategic investments announced by us or our competitors general economic or stock market conditions unrelated to our operating performance 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities  many companies have been the subject of securities class action litigation 
if we were sued in a securities class action  it would result in substantial costs as well as a diversion of our management s attention and resources  and it would likely cause the market price of our common stock to fall 
political and social turmoil could make it difficult for us and our customers to accurately forecast and plan future business activities and could negatively impact our business 
increasing political and social turmoil  such as military actions and terrorist activities  can be expected to put further pressure on economic conditions in the united states and foreign jurisdictions and are placing pressure on our business operations 
for example  certain of our conference events in various geographies  such as the middle east  were postponed in light of potential ongoing military action in the region 
additionally  as a result of military action and terrorist activities  we have issued to our employees cautionary advice with respect to their travel 
these conditions make it difficult for us and our customers to accurately forecast and plan future business activities and may delay our development plans and our sales  particularly in the geographically affected areas 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk in  the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates related primarily to borrowings under its million credit facility  which consisted of a million revolving credit line and an million term loan 
at december   there was million in borrowings outstanding under this facility 
under the facility  interest was computed on outstanding borrowings at the rate of libor plus or the higher of a the prime rate or b the federal funds rate plus 
in january  the company repaid all amounts outstanding under its credit facility 
in march  the company executed a new million credit agreement with its bank the amended facility 
the amended facility consists of a million revolving credit facility 
the company borrowed and repaid million under this facility during  and has no borrowing outstanding under this facility as of december  under the amended facility  interest on any outstanding borrowings will be payable at the rate of libor plus or the higher of a the prime rate or b the federal funds rate plus 
the company believes that an increase or a decrease of ten percent in the effective interest rate on available borrowings on its facility  if fully utilized  would not have a material effect on future results of operations 
investment risk the company is exposed to market risk as it relates to changes in the market value of its strategic investments 
the company made investments in and advances to companies in parallel or synergistic industries to that of the company s 
during and  the company recorded million and million  respectively  in impairment losses on its investments and advances 
during   the company did not record any impairment loss on its investments and advances 
as of december   the company had investments and advances totaling million 
these investments and advances are inherently risky because the companies we invested in are private companies that are typically in the early development stages 
adverse changes in market conditions and poor operating results of the underlying investments may result in the company incurring additional losses or an inability to recover the remaining value of its investments and advances 
foreign currency exchange risk the company is exposed to market risk as it relates to foreign currency exchange rates 
revenues and expenses in foreign currencies translate into higher or lower revenues and expenses in us dollars as the us dollar weakens or strengthens against foreign currencies 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates may therefore negatively affect the company s consolidated revenues and expenses  and net investment in foreign subsidiaries 
currency transaction gains or losses arising from transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of the company s foreign subsidiaries are included in the results of operations 
such gains and losses were not material to the company s consolidated results of operations during and the company believes that an increase or a decrease of ten percent in foreign currency exchange rates would not have a material effect on future results of operations 
the company has not entered into foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates
