item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that might cause such differences include general economic  market  or business conditions  the opportunities or lack thereof that may be presented to and pursued by us  the availability and price of raw materials we use  competitive actions by other companies  changes in laws or regulations  and the accuracy of our judgments and estimates concerning the integration of acquired operations and our consolidation and supply chain initiatives  and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
results of operations for the years  and summary a summary of our consolidated results for the last three years follows for the year in millions  except per share consolidated revenues income from continuing operations income from continuing operations per diluted share significant items affecting income from continuing operations included weak industry box demand and lower prices  continued excess capacity in most of our forest products  higher energy costs and higher pension expense  partially offset by improvements in financial services earnings  charges and expenses of million related to the sale or closure of under performing assets  the consolidation of administrative functions  the early repayment of debt  and a one time tax benefit of million resulting from the resolution and settlement of prior years tax examinations 
business segments we manage our operations through three business segments corrugated packaging  forest products  and financial services 
our operations are affected to varying degrees by supply and demand factors and economic conditions including changes in interest rates  new housing starts  home repair and remodeling activities  and the strength of the us dollar 
given the commodity nature of our manufactured products  we have little control over market pricing or market demand 
we acquired effective control of gaylord and began consolidating its results in march in may  we sold million shares of common stock and issued million of upper decs sm units and million of senior notes 
we also acquired a box plant in puerto rico in march  certain assets of mack packaging group  inc in may  and fibre innovations llc in november in  we acquired the corrugated packaging operations of chesapeake corporation  elgin corrugated box company and compro packaging llc 
in the aggregate  these acquisitions and financing transactions significantly increased the assets and operations of our corrugated packaging segment and changed our capital structure 
as a result  
table of contents and financial information is not comparable to prior periods 
these acquisitions did not create any new business segments 
corrugated packaging we manufacture linerboard and corrugating medium that we convert into corrugated packaging and sell in the open market 
our corrugated packaging segment revenues are principally derived from the sales of corrugated packaging products and  to a lesser degree  from the sales of linerboard in the domestic and export markets 
a summary of our corrugated packaging results for the last three years follows for the year in millions revenues segment operating income loss due to the integration of the operations we acquired in  we cannot readily quantify the effects these acquisitions had on our operating income  but we believe it was significant 
the operations we acquired in did not contribute significantly to our operating income 
the acquired operations contributed million in revenues in and million in as a result of the weak us economy over the past three years and the decline in export demand due to increased offshore linerboard capacity  we have generally experienced declines in our product pricing and shipments 
however  on a volume per workday basis  industry box shipments began to improve in the second half of and were up percent in fourth quarter compared with fourth quarter our shipments were up three percent in fourth quarter compared with fourth quarter as a result of this improved demand and a generally improving us economy  in january  we announced a per ton increase in the price of linerboard effective march  year over year increase decrease corrugated packaging average prices shipments  per workday a industry shipments  average week b linerboard average prices shipments  tons a a shipments are pro forma to reflect the acquisition of gaylord in b source fibre box association other factors affecting operating income include fluctuations in the following costs and expenses year over year increase decrease in millions occ recycled fiber energy  principally natural gas depreciation goodwill amortization pension and postretirement 
table of contents occ represented percent of our raw material requirements in  percent in  and percent in our occ costs averaged per ton in  per ton in  and per ton in at year end  occ prices were per ton compared with per ton at year end  and per ton at year end our occ and energy costs fluctuate based on the market prices we pay for these commodities 
we hedge very little of our occ and energy needs 
it is likely that these costs will continue to fluctuate during the increase in depreciation in was principally due to the facilities we acquired in the reduction in depreciation expense in was due to the lengthening of estimated useful lives of certain production equipment beginning january the reduction in goodwill amortization was due to the adoption of a new accounting pronouncement that precluded the amortization of goodwill 
see pension and postretirement matters for information regarding pension expense 
information about our mills and converting facilities follows for the year number of converting facilities at year end mill capacity  in million tons mill production  in million tons percent mill production used internally production downtime  excluding routine maintenance  in million tons in september  we permanently closed the  ton recycle linerboard mill in antioch  california obtained in the gaylord acquisition 
market conditions continue to be weak for gypsum facing paper 
as a result  our premier boxboard limited llc joint venture continues to produce both gypsum facing paper and corrugating medium 
we purchased  tons of this medium in   tons in  and  tons in it is uncertain when market conditions for lightweight gypsum facing paper will improve to levels that eliminate the venture s production of corrugating medium 
of the non strategic assets we obtained in the gaylord acquisition  we sold the retail bag business  the multi wall bag business  the kraft paper mill and other assets for approximately million 
the only non strategic asset that remains is the chemical business  which we expect to sell upon final resolution of its class action and mississippi state court litigation 
we classified these businesses as discontinued operations and excluded their operating results from segment operating income 
we continue our efforts to enhance return on investment 
this includes reviewing operations that are unable to meet return objectives and determining appropriate courses of action  including possibly consolidating and closing converting facilities 
we will continue these efforts in in  we closed three converting facilities and announced organizational changes and work force reductions to eliminate approximately positions 
we also finalized plans to close another three converting facilities during the first half of and sell certain assets used in our specialty packaging operations 
as a result  we incurred million in severance costs  most of which was paid in  and million in asset impairments 
while we recognized asset impairments for the facilities to be closed or sold in  we have not yet determined the severance and other exit costs related to these activities  though it is likely they will be significant 
we will incur and expense these costs in as a result of the and facility closures  we anticipate reductions in our fixed costs  payroll and other operating costs and increased utilization of existing facilities  all of which should have a positive effect on operating income 
in  as part of the gaylord acquisition accounting  we established accruals for the estimated closure costs of the antioch mill  and we recorded the land and equipment at its estimated fair value less cost to sell 
the closure accruals totaled million  which included million for involuntary 
table of contents terminations of the work force  million for contract terminations  million for environmental compliance  and million for demolition and clean up 
at year end  the accrual balance was million the majority of which we expect to settle or pay in we expect to sell the land and equipment over the next several years 
in  we sold our corrugated packaging operation in chile at a loss of million 
we also restructured and downsized our specialty packaging operations at a loss of million and recognized an impairment charge of million related to our interest in a glass bottling venture in puerto rico 
all of these items are included in other operating expenses and are excluded from segment operating income 
forest products we own or lease two million acres of timberlands in texas  louisiana  georgia  and alabama 
we grow timber  cut the timber and convert it into products 
we manufacture lumber  particleboard  gypsum wallboard  fiberboard and medium density fiberboard mdf 
our forest products segment revenues are principally derived from the sales of these products and  to a lesser degree  from sales of fiber and high value timberlands 
a summary of our forest products results for the last three years follows for the year in millions revenues segment operating income as a result of excess industry capacity during the past three years  prices for most of our building products have been at low levels 
however  recent industry capacity closures and strong housing and remodeling markets have generally resulted in improving prices and shipments for our products in the second half of year over year increase decrease lumber average prices shipments particleboard average prices shipments gypsum average prices shipments mdf average prices shipments other factors affecting operating income include fluctuations in the following costs and expenses year over year increase decrease in millions energy  principally natural gas depreciation pension and postretirement 
table of contents our energy costs fluctuate based on the market prices we pay for these commodities 
we hedge very little of our energy needs 
it is likely that these costs will continue to fluctuate during the reduction in depreciation expense in was due to the lengthening of estimated useful lives of certain production equipment beginning january see pension and postretirement matters for information regarding pension expense 
information about our converting and manufacturing facilities follows for the year number of converting and manufacturing facilities at year end range of operating rates for all product lines high low in each of the years presented  we curtailed production in most product lines to varying degrees due to market conditions 
our joint venture operations also experienced production curtailments in and due to market conditions 
it is likely that we will continue to curtail production to varying degrees in the various product lines in our del tin fiber llc mdf joint venture in el dorado  arkansas continues to experience production and cost issues 
in january  deltic timber corporation  our partner  announced its intention to exit this business upon the earliest  reasonable opportunity provided by the market 
during december  they announced their decision to discontinue efforts to sell their investment and instead focus their attention on improving the venture s operations 
in  we classified our million acres of timberlands into three categories strategic  million acres  non strategic   acres  and high value   acres 
in september  we sold  acres of the non strategic timberlands for million resulting in a gain of million  which was included in other operating income 
the remaining non strategic timberlands will be sold over time 
the high value land is located around atlanta  georgia and will be sold over time 
in  we sold  acres of these high value lands compared with  acres in  and  acres in these sales increased segment operating income by million in  million in  and million in we continue our efforts to enhance return on investment 
this includes reviewing operations that are unable to meet return objectives and determining appropriate courses of action 
in addition  we are continuing to address market and production cost issues at our mdf facilities  including the del tin fiber joint venture 
in  we indefinitely closed our clarion  pennsylvania mdf plant and our mt 
jewett  pennsylvania particleboard plant  resulting in million in severance costs 
as a result of these indefinite closures  we anticipate reductions in payroll and operating costs and increased utilization of existing mdf and particleboard facilities  all of which should have a positive effect on operations 
we also sold the fiber cement assets  which were leased to a third party  and other non strategic assets and incurred a loss of million 
the sale of the leased assets will not have a significant effect on operations 
all these charges are included in other operating expense and excluded from segment operating income 
financial services we own a savings bank and engage in mortgage banking  real estate development and insurance brokerage activities 
our savings bank makes up the predominant amount of our financial services segment operating income  revenues  assets  and liabilities 
in general  we gather funds from depositors  borrow money and invest the resulting cash in loans and securities 
the difference between the interest rates we pay on our liabilities and those we receive on our loans and securities  which is our net interest spread  is the principal driver of our segment operating income 

table of contents a summary of our financial services results for the last three years follows for the year in millions net interest income segment operating income as a result of declining interest rates and continued strong competition for attracting deposits  our net interest spread decreased in however  beginning in fourth quarter  our net interest spread widened approximately basis points as a large portion of our certificates of deposit matured and we were able to reprice them at lower current market rates upon renewal 
information concerning our interest rate spread follows for the year average yield average yield average yield balance rate balance rate balance rate dollars in millions earning assets interest bearing liabilities interest rate spread we are currently in an asset sensitive position  which means that increases in interest rates generally increase our net interest income and decreases in interest rates generally decrease our net interest income 
although we are asset sensitive  our net interest income is not as sensitive to changes in interest rates at year end as it was at year end because we have increased the percentage of residential housing assets we own  even though these assets may have lower yields than commercial real estate and other loans  because we believe these assets generally have lower risk 
the majority of the increase in our residential housing assets has been in single family mortgage loans 
many of these new loans have fixed interest rates for the first three to five years and then adjust annually thereafter 
we have shifted our deposit base to more interest bearing demand deposits and less certificates of deposit 
interest bearing demand deposits generally cost us less  and also reprice more frequently than certificates of deposit 
the following tables summarize the composition of our earning assets and deposits at year end in millions residential housing assets loans and securities other earning assets total earning assets residential housing assets as a percentage of earning assets at year end in millions deposit and savings accounts certificates of deposit total deposits 
table of contents other factors affecting operating income include fluctuations in the following non interest income and expenses year over year increase decrease in millions noninterest income gains on mortgage loan sales servicing rights amortization and impairment real estate operations the changes in gain on mortgage loan sales and servicing rights amortization and impairment were principally due to the substantial increase in our origination of mortgage loans held for sale in and and prepayments on loans we service for third parties 
the increased volume of originations and prepayments was principally due to the high level of refinance activity resulting from the low interest rate environment 
however  interest rates rose in the second half of and origination volume  as well as pricing  declined substantially 
information regarding mortgage loan production activity follows for the year dollars in millions loans originated for sale to third parties gains on loan sales as a percent of originations value of mortgage servicing rights retained we retain the rights to service some of the loans we sell to secondary markets  but do not retain any other interests in those loans 
the low interest rate environment also increased prepayments on the mortgage loans we service for others 
if interest rates rise  it is likely that prepayments  mortgage servicing rights amortization  and our impairment valuation allowance will decrease 
the following table summarizes information regarding the mortgage loans we service for others and our mortgage servicing rights at year end or for the year dollars in billions outstanding balance of loans serviced for third parties annualized prepayment rate carrying amount of mortgage servicing rights as a percent of principal balance serviced year over year increase decrease in millions noninterest expense compensation and benefits real estate operations all of the increase in compensation expense in and relates to our mortgage banking operation s higher production activity 
a substantial portion of our mortgage banking operation s production related costs are directly variable with production activities and will decline in if production continues to remain at the decreased level of late however  other mortgage banking production related operating costs are fixed or only partially variable 

table of contents in both and  we exited certain activities and product delivery methods that were not expected to meet return objectives 
in addition  we consolidated various activities to improve efficiency 
these actions resulted in expenses of million in and million in related to severance and asset write offs 
these items are excluded from segment operating income 
we continue to assess our product lines and operations for further efficiencies and return improvements 
asset quality and allowance for loan losses the following table summarizes various asset quality measures at year end dollars in millions non performing loans restructured operating lease assets foreclosed real estate non performing assets non performing loans as a percentage of total loans non performing assets ratio allowance for loan losses non performing loans allowance for loan losses total loans we stop accruing interest on loans when we believe it is probable we will not collect all contractually due principal and interest 
we apply interest payments received on nonaccrual loans to reduce principal 
interest income on impaired loans in and income we would have recognized on non accrual loans had they been performing in accordance with their contractual terms was not significant 
at year end  we had loans totaling million that had characteristics indicating potential problems 
the borrowers on these loans are currently performing in accordance with contractual terms  but we have concerns about the borrowers ability to continue to comply with contractual terms because of operating or financial difficulties 
these potential problem loans include a million commercial real estate loan collateralized by a two building office complex in which the sole tenant has filed bankruptcy 
we are currently negotiating with the borrower to restructure this loan 
a million asset based loan collateralized by servicing rights and the unguaranteed portion on small business loans 
the borrower has experienced recent liquidity difficulties and is in the process of selling its company 
virtually all of our commercial real estate loans are collateralized and performing in accordance with contractual terms 
however  many of the borrowers have completed construction on the projects being financed  or are nearing completion  and many of the loans are nearing maturity 
we underwrote most of the loans with the expectation that the borrowers would secure permanent financing or sell the property before maturity of our loan 
some of the borrowers with completed projects have not been able to achieve the lease up schedules originally anticipated 
in the current real estate environment  it is likely that this condition could continue 
this may make permanent financing difficult to secure and sales may require longer marketing periods or may not be possible 
many of these loans contain options that permit the borrowers to extend the term of the loans if defined operating levels are achieved  and it is likely these borrowers may elect to extend the term of the loans 
additionally  we have started extending longer term financing to some of our construction borrowers with completed projects that meet acceptable loan to value and cash flow operating result requirements 

table of contents we believe our allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover probable losses 
factors that influence our judgments regarding the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and the amounts charged to expense include conditions affecting borrower liquidity and collateral values for impaired loans  risk characteristics for groups of loans that are not considered individually impaired but we believe have probable potential losses  risk characteristics for homogeneous pools of loans  and other risk factors that we believe are not apparent in historical information 
we reduce our allowance for loan losses for net charge offs and increase it with charges to income 
the following table summarizes changes in the allowance for loan losses 
for the year dollars in millions balance at beginning of year net charge offs provision for loan losses allowance on acquired loans balance at end of year net charge offs as a percentage of average loans outstanding charge offs for related principally to two commercial real estate loans  two commercial and business loans  restructured aircraft leases  and several asset based lending loans 
charge offs for related principally to two senior housing loans  two commercial and business loans  and several asset based lending and leasing credits 
although we have de emphasized our asset based lending activities  it is likely we will continue to experience some credit losses related to that portfolio 
in  we restructured two leveraged  direct financing leases on cargo aircraft in which we are the lessor 
due to a reduction in the lease payments  we reclassified the leases as operating leases  recorded the aircraft in our balance sheet and wrote them down to fair value of million 
we are depreciating the aircraft over their remaining expected useful lives 
the restructured leases are currently paying in accordance with the modified terms 
however  the lessee filed a reorganization bankruptcy plan in and we have agreed to reduce future lease payments 
the reduction in lease payments did not give rise to an additional impairment charge 
for additional statistical and financial information about our financial services segment  see statistical data at the end of this item 
unallocated expenses  other income expense and interest unallocated general and administrative expenses were million in  million in and million in the change in was principally due to changes in pension costs and stock based compensation 
the changes in and were primarily due to changes in pension costs 
see pension and postretirement matters for further information 
the change in stock based compensation was principally due to the use of treasury stock to fund the k matching contributions 
as a result of our consolidation of administration functions and adoption of a shared services concept  beginning first quarter  we will change the way we allocate costs to our business segments 
the effect of this change will be to increase segment operating income and to increase unallocated expenses by a like amount 

table of contents other operating income expense items are not allocated to business segments 
in addition to the items previously discussed within the segments  the remainder of unallocated other operating income expense includes in  we incurred million of expenses related to initiatives to consolidate administrative functions and effect improvements in supply chain management 
our consolidation of administrative functions should be completed in early while we expect the improvements in supply chain to be ongoing 
it is likely that expenses to effect these initiatives in will be less than million 
in  we incurred a million charge related to the purchase of promissory notes sold with recourse 
in  we incurred a million charge related to a fair value adjustment of an interest rate swap agreement before it was designated as a cash flow hedge 
non operating expenses and parent company interest expense are not allocated to business segments 
in and  non operating expenses consisted of a call premium and write offs of unamortized financing fees related to early repayments of borrowings 
our parent company interest expense was million in  million in and million in the change in was due to an increase in debt for acquisitions offset in part by a million reduction in borrowings 
the average interest rate on our borrowings was percent in  percent in and percent in at year end  we had  million of debt with fixed interest rates that average percent and million of debt with variable interest rates that average percent 
income taxes our effective tax rate was a tax benefit of percent in  and a tax expense of percent in and percent in our rate reflects a one time  percent  benefit realized from the resolution of tax examinations and claims discussed below 
our rate reflects a one time  three percent benefit realized from the sale of our corrugated packaging operation in chile 
other differences between the effective tax rate and the statutory rate are due to state income taxes  nondeductible items  foreign operating losses  and other items for which no financial benefit is recognized until realized 
during  the internal revenue service concluded its examination of our tax returns through  including matters related to net operating losses and minimum tax credit carryforwards  which resulted from certain deductions following our acquisition of guaranty and for which no financial accounting benefit had been recognized 
also  we resolved certain state tax refund claims for the years through as a result  valuation allowances and tax accruals previously provided for these matters were no longer required  and we recorded a one time benefit of million  or per diluted share 
of this one time benefit  million represents cash refunds of previously paid taxes plus related interest 
the remainder was a non cash benefit 
based on our current expectations of income and expense  it is likely that our effective tax rate will approximate percent 
average shares outstanding our average diluted shares outstanding were million in  million in and million in the changes in and were primarily the result of our may sale of million shares of common stock 
the dilutive effect of our outstanding stock options and equity purchase contracts was not significant in any of the years presented 
capital resources and liquidity for the year a significant portion of our consolidated net assets invested in financial services are subject  in varying degrees  to regulatory rules and regulations including restrictions on the ability of financial services to pay dividends to us 
accordingly  the parent company and the financial services capital resources and liquidity are discussed separately 

table of contents parent company operating activities cash provided by operations was million in and million in depreciation and other non cash charges and credits were million in and million in dividends received from financial services were million in and million in our working capital was essentially unchanged from the prior year 
working capital is always subject to the timing of payments on payables and collections on receivables 
investing activities our investing activities used million in and million in the change was principally due to the million used in for acquisitions 
capital expenditures were million in  percent of depreciation  and million in  percent of depreciation 
capital expenditures are expected to approximate million in  percent of expected depreciation 
proceeds from our sales of non strategic or under performing assets were million in and million in we made no capital contributions to financial services in or financing activities our financing activities used million in  but provided million in the change was principally due to the acquisition related financing transactions 
debt was reduced by million in we paid cash dividends to our shareholders of million  or per share  in and million  or per share  in in february  we increased the quarterly cash dividend to per share 
in february  we announced an increase in the quarterly cash dividend to per share 
liquidity our sources of short term funding are our operating cash flows  which include dividends received from financial services  and borrowings under our existing credit arrangements and accounts receivable securitization program 
we operate in cyclical industries  and our operating cash flows vary accordingly 
the dividends we receive from financial services are dependent on its level of earnings and capital needs and are subject to regulatory approval and restrictions 
at year end  our contractual cash obligations consist of payment due or expiring by year total thereafter in millions long term debt a capital leases operating leases purchase obligations other long term liabilities total a includes contractual interest payments based on our current estimates  contributions to the postretirement and defined benefit plans will likely be between million to million per year for the next several years 
see pension and postretirement matters for further information 
at year end  we had million in unused borrowing capacity under our credit agreements and million under our accounts receivable securitization program  which matures in april most of our 
table of contents credit agreements contain terms and conditions customary for such agreements including minimum levels of interest coverage and limitations on leverage 
at year end  we complied with all the terms and conditions of our credit agreements and of our accounts receivable securitization program 
none of our credit agreements or our accounts receivable securitization program are restricted as to availability based on our long term debt ratings 
in  we redeemed all of our debentures payable the principal amount of million and the call premium of million were funded by draws on the accounts receivable securitization program 
in addition  we converted million of tax exempt bonds from variable interest rate to fixed interest rate and remarketed these bonds at par 
these bonds now have a weighted average interest rate of percent 
our contractual cash obligations due in will likely be repaid from borrowings under our existing credit agreements  accounts receivable securitization program  or operating cash flow 
off balance sheet arrangements at year end  our commercial commitments consist of expiring by year total thereafter in millions joint venture guarantees performance bonds and recourse obligations total we participate in three joint ventures engaged in manufacturing and selling paper and forest products 
our partner in each of these ventures is a publicly held company 
at year end  these ventures had million in long term debt of which we had guaranteed debt service obligations and letters of credit aggregating million 
generally we would be called upon to fund the guarantees due to the lack of specific performance by the joint ventures  such as non payment of debt 
approximately million in joint venture funding obligations include rating triggers  which could result in acceleration if our long term debt rating falls below investment grade 
we have also guaranteed the repayment of million of borrowings by a financial services subsidiary 
in addition  the preferred stock issued by subsidiaries of guaranty is automatically exchanged into preferred stock of guaranty upon the occurrence of certain regulatory events or administrative actions 
if such exchange occurs  certain preferred shares are automatically surrendered to us in exchange for our senior notes and certain shares  at our option  are either exchanged for our senior notes or are redeemed by us 
at year end  the outstanding preferred stock issued by these subsidiaries totaled million 
we have an interest rate and several commodity derivative instruments outstanding at year end the interest rate instrument expires in and the majority of the commodity instruments expire in these instruments are non exchange traded and are valued using either third party resources or models 
at year end  the aggregate fair value of all derivatives was a million liability 
financial services operating activities cash provided by operations was million in and million in the increase was principally because we originated fewer mortgage loans held for sale near the end of than near the end of investing activities our investing activities used million in and billion in the decrease was principally a result of lower securities purchases in 
table of contents financing activities our financing activities used million in and provided billion in in we borrowed substantially more under repurchase agreements than we had previously 
in  we replaced more than half of these borrowings with variable rate and term federal home loan bank borrowings 
our deposit liabilities also decreased in as we experienced withdrawals of maturing certificates of deposit as a result of the low interest rate environment 
in  guaranty paid million in dividends to the parent company 
a change in guaranty s mix of earning assets reduced its regulatory capital requirements  which allowed for a dividend in excess of earnings 
it is unlikely that dividends will exceed earnings in liquidity our sources of short term funding are our operating cash flows  new deposits  borrowings under our existing agreements and  if necessary  sales of assets 
assets that can be readily converted to cash or against which we can readily borrow include short term investments  loans  mortgage loans held for sale  and securities 
at year end  we had available liquidity of billion 
at year end  our contractual cash obligations consist of payment due or expiring by year total thereafter in millions transaction and savings deposit accounts certificates of deposit a fhlb advances a repurchase agreements a other borrowings a preferred stock issued by subsidiaries operating leases total a includes contractual interest payments our transaction and savings deposit accounts are shown as maturing in these accounts do not have a contractual maturity  but rather  are due on demand 
most of the certificates of deposit that do mature in are short term one year or less and a high percentage of the depositors have historically renewed at maturity  although they have no contractual obligation to do so 
unless renegotiated  the terms of the preferred stock issued by subsidiaries make it likely we will redeem the preferred stock in at the liquidation preference amount 
off balance sheet arrangements we enter into commitments to extend credit for loans  leases  and letters of credit in the normal course of our business 
these commitments carry substantially the same risk as loans 
we generally require collateral upon funding of these commitments  the receipt of which provides assets that generally increase our liquidity 

table of contents these commitments normally include provisions allowing us to exit the commitment under certain circumstances 
at year end  our unfunded commitments consist of expiring by year total thereafter in millions single family mortgage loans other loans letters of credit total regulatory limitations at year end  guaranty met or exceeded all applicable regulatory capital requirements 
we expect to maintain guaranty s capital at a level that exceeds the minimum required for designation as well capitalized under the capital adequacy regulations of the office of thrift supervision ots 
from time to time  we may make capital contributions to or receive dividends from guaranty 
selected financial and regulatory capital data for guaranty and its consolidated mortgage banking and insurance subsidiaries follow at year end in millions balance sheet data total assets total deposits shareholder s equity regulatory for categorization as actual minimum well capitalized regulatory capital ratios tangible capital n a leverage capital risk based capital at year end  guaranty had outstanding preferred stock of subsidiaries with a carrying amount and liquidation value of million 
these preferred stocks will be automatically exchanged into guaranty preferred stock if the ots determines guaranty is or will become undercapitalized in the near term or upon the occurrence of certain administrative actions 
if such an exchange were to occur  we must issue senior notes in exchange for the guaranty preferred stock in an amount equal to the liquidation preference of the preferred stock exchanged 
with respect to certain of these shares  we have the option to issue senior notes or redeem the shares 
at year end  million of the subsidiary preferred stock qualifies as core leverage capital and the remainder qualifies as tier supplemental risk based capital 
pension and postretirement matters based on our annual actuarial measurement and valuation in september  the projected benefit obligation of our defined benefit plans exceeded the related plan assets by million in compared with million in the change in funded status was principally due to an increase in the present value of future pension benefits due to a decrease in the discount rate to percent offset in part by an increase in the value of the plan assets 

table of contents for the year  we expect to incur non cash pension expense of million compared with million in the change in non cash pension expense is principally due to an increase in the recognition of the accumulated decline in the fair value of plan assets and to a decrease in the discount rate 
for the year  we expect the cash funding requirements of the defined benefit plans to be less than million 
the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of was enacted in december this act expands medicare to include  for the first time  coverage for prescription drugs 
our postretirement benefit plans provide for medical coverage including prescription drugs 
while we have not completed the analysis to determine the effects of the act on our postretirement benefit plans  it is likely that the act will ultimately reduce our cost for these plans 
since this legislation was enacted after our annual measurement date  its effect on our postretirement plans will be reflected in our annual measurement 
energy and the effects of inflation energy costs increased million in  decreased million in  and increased million in  principally due to changes in natural gas prices 
our energy costs fluctuate based on the market prices we pay for these commodities 
we hedge very little of our energy needs 
it is likely that these costs will continue to fluctuate during inflation has had minimal effects on operating results the last three years 
our fixed assets  timber and timberlands are reflected at their historical costs 
if reflected at current replacement costs  depreciation expense and the cost of timber cut or timberlands sold would be significantly higher than amounts reported 
environmental matters we are committed to protecting the health and welfare of our employees  the public  and the environment and strive to maintain compliance with all state and federal environmental regulations in a manner that is cost effective 
when we construct new facilities or modernize existing facilities  we generally use state of the art technology for air and water emissions 
this forward looking approach is intended to minimize the effect that changing regulations have on capital expenditures for environmental compliance 
we have been designated as a potentially responsible party at five superfund sites  excluding sites as to which our records disclose no involvement or as to which our potential liability has been finally determined 
at year end  we estimated the undiscounted total costs we could incur remediating these superfund sites to be approximately million  all of which we have accrued at year end we use landfills to dispose of non hazardous waste at three paperboard mills and two forest products facilities 
based on costs incurred in the closure of our other landfills  we expect to spend  on an undiscounted basis  approximately million over the next years to ensure proper closure of these landfills 
we are remediating a former creosote treating facility and two on site locations obtained in the gaylord acquisition 
we expect to spend  on an undiscounted basis  approximately million remediating these sites 
on april   the us environmental protection agency the epa issued extensive regulations governing air and water emissions from the pulp and paper industry the cluster rule 
compliance with various phases of the cluster rule will be required at certain intervals over the next few years 
we have spent approximately million toward cluster rule compliance through  excluding expenditures related to discontinued operations 
future expenditures related to cluster rule compliance under high volume low concentration maximum achievable control technology mact i rules are required to be completed in we estimate capital expenditures for compliance with these rules to be million 
not included in the phase i cluster rule was the mact ii standard for the control of hazardous air pollutant emissions from pulp and paper mill combustion sources 
final promulgation of the mact ii standard occurred on december   and applies to three of our paperboard mills 
preliminary estimates indicate that our total capital expenditures for monitoring both particulate matter and gaseous hazardous air pollutants haps associated with the reporting and record keeping activities of the mact ii standard could be million through future national emission standards for haps will apply to facilities that are major sources of 
table of contents haps in the plywood and composite wood products industry 
we estimate we will spend approximately million between and on capital expenditures to comply with these proposed standards 
litigation and related matters we are involved in various legal proceedings that have arisen from time to time in the ordinary course of business 
we believe that the possibility of a material liability from any of these proceedings is remote  and we do not believe that the outcome of any of these proceedings should have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flow

the complaint alleged that the defendants  during the period from october   through november   conspired to limit the supply of linerboard  and that the purpose and effect of the alleged conspiracy was artificially to increase prices of corrugated containers 
inland and gaylord executed a settlement agreement on april   with the representatives of the class  which has been approved by the trial court 
gaylord and inland paid a total of million into escrow to fulfill the terms of the settlement  which amount was within the amount we previously accrued in connection with this matter 
prior to the deadline for potential class members to opt out of the class action lawsuit  over companies and their named subsidiaries had advised the court of their opt out election 
twelve individual complaints brought by certain of these opt out plaintiffs and over  of their named subsidiaries have since been filed against the defendants in this action 
as a result of the opt outs  we received a refund of  from the original settlement amount 
we believe that the plaintiffs allegations in the opt out litigation have no merit and are vigorously defending against the suits 
we believe the likelihood of a material loss from this litigation is remote and do not believe that the final outcome should have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operation  or cash flow 
gaylord chemical litigation on october   a rail tank car of nitrogen tetroxide exploded at the bogalusa  louisiana plant of gaylord chemical corporation  a wholly owned  independently operated subsidiary of gaylord 
following the explosion  more than lawsuits were filed against gaylord  gaylord chemical  and third parties alleging personal injury  property damage  economic loss  related injuries and fear of injuries 
plaintiffs sought compensatory and punitive damages 
in  the washington parish  louisiana  trial court certified these consolidated cases as a class action 
by the deadline to file proof of claim forms   persons had filed and  persons had opted out of the louisiana class proceeding 
all but of the opt out claimants are also plaintiffs in the mississippi action described below 
gaylord  gaylord chemical  and other third parties were also named defendants in approximately  individual actions brought by plaintiffs in mississippi state court  who claimed injury as a result of the same accident 
these cases were consolidated in hinds county  mississippi  and alleged claims and damages similar to those in louisiana state court 
in  of the approximately  mississippi cases went to trial in hinds county  mississippi 
after a three month trial  gaylord chemical was held to be percent at fault for the incident  and none of the plaintiffs was awarded any damages 
at trial in the louisiana class action held during the second half of  randomly selected plaintiffs presented evidence of their claims 
the jury found gaylord chemical was percent responsible for the accident and that other co defendants shared percent of the fault 
seven of the plaintiffs were found to have suffered no damages 
the remaining plaintiffs were awarded a total of  in compensatory damages 
the jury also determined that gaylord was not responsible for the conduct of gaylord chemical 

table of contents on december   gaylord  gaylord chemical  and certain of their insurers agreed in principle to settle the claims from the class action and mississippi state court actions  including claims for compensatory and punitive damages  arising from this accident 
in exchange for payments by certain insurance carriers and assignment of insurance coverage rights against the non settling carriers  gaylord and gaylord chemical will receive releases and or dismissals of all claims for damages  including punitive damages 
neither gaylord nor gaylord chemical contributed to the settlement 
the class action component of this proposed settlement will be submitted for preliminary approval by the louisiana court in march the class settlement is subject to a fairness hearing and final court approval  which we expect to occur during full releases and dismissals of all mississippi claims  opt outs  and other intervenors are not expected to occur until at least until such time  all settlement proceeds will be held in escrow pending receipt of all required settlement documents 
on december   the louisiana jury awarded punitive damages of million against gaylord chemical  which will be pursued by the plaintiffs against the non settling insurance carriers 
this award does not affect the settlement by gaylord and gaylord chemical 
other in  we formed guaranty then known as guaranty federal savings bank to acquire substantially all the assets and deposit liabilities of three thrift institutions from the federal savings and loan insurance corporation  as receiver of those institutions 
in connection with the acquisition  the government entered into an assistance agreement with us in which various tax benefits were promised 
in  congress enacted narrowly targeted legislation to eliminate a portion of the promised tax benefits 
we filed suit against the united states in the us court of federal claims alleging  among other things  that the legislation breached our contract and that we are entitled to monetary damages 
this lawsuit is currently in the discovery stage and is not expected to be resolved for several years 
we cannot predict the likely outcome of this litigation 
accounting policies critical accounting estimates in preparing our financial statements  we follow generally accepted accounting principles  which in many cases requires us to make assumptions  estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported 
our significant accounting policies are included in note a to the summarized financial statements of the parent company and financial services and note to the consolidated financial statements 
many of these principles are relatively straightforward 
there are  however  a few accounting policies that are critical because they are important in determining our financial condition and results  and they are difficult for us to apply 
within the parent company  they include asset impairments and pension accounting  and within financial services  they include the allowance for loan losses and mortgage servicing rights 
the difficulty in applying these policies arises from the assumptions  estimates and judgments that we have to make currently about matters that are inherently uncertain  such as future economic conditions  operating results and valuations  as well as management intentions 
as the difficulty increases  the level of precision decreases  meaning actual results can and probably will be different from those currently estimated 
we base our assumptions  estimates and judgments on a combination of historical experiences and other factors that we believe are reasonable 
measuring assets for impairment requires estimating intentions as to holding periods  future operating cash flows and residual values of the assets under review 
changes in our intentions  market conditions or operating performance could indicate that impairment charges might be necessary 
the expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets is an important assumption in determining pension expense 
in selecting that rate  consideration is given to both historical returns and future returns over the next quarter century 
differences between actual and expected returns will affect future pension expense 
allowances for loan losses are based on historical experiences and evaluations of future cash flows and collateral values and are subject to regulatory scrutiny 
changes in general economic conditions or loan specific circumstances will inevitably change those evaluations 
measuring for impairment and amortizing mortgage servicing rights is largely dependent upon the speed at which loans are repaid and market rates of return 
changes in interest rates will 
table of contents affect both of these variables and could indicate that impairments or adjustments of the rate of amortization might be necessary 
a summary of the sensitivity of certain of our critical accounting policies to changes in estimates at year end follows pension costs a basis point change in the estimated expected rate of return would affect annual pension costs by million 
in addition  a basis point change in the discount rate would affect the funded status by million and pension costs by million 
mortgage servicing rights a one percent decrease in long term mortgage rates would increase the allowance for impairment by million 
a one percent increase in rates would reduce the allowance by million 
during  we completed an assessment of the estimated useful lives of certain production equipment  which resulted in a revision of estimated useful lives 
these revisions ranged from a reduction of several years to a lengthening of up to five years 
accordingly  beginning  we began computing depreciation of certain production equipment using revised estimated useful lives  which reduced depreciation expense by million and increased net income by million or per diluted share 
new accounting pronouncements adopted in  we adopted a number of new accounting pronouncements  the more significant being we voluntarily began expensing stock options beginning with options granted in  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment of fasb statement no 
when options are granted  we estimate their fair value and charge that amount to expense over the vesting period 
previously  we used the intrinsic value method of accounting for stock options  which generally resulted in no expense being recognized 
the effect of expensing stock options was to reduce net income by million or per share 
we were required to begin recognizing legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets at their fair value and allocate that expense over the useful live of the asset  sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
the effect of adopting this statement was to increase property  plant and equipment by million  recognize an asset retirement obligation liability of million  and to increase first quarter net loss by million or per share for the cumulative effect of adoption 
we were required to adopt new rules for classifying and measuring as liabilities certain financial instruments that embody obligations of the issuer and have characteristics of both liabilities and equity  sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
the effect on earnings and financial position of adopting this statement was not material 
provisions of this statement addressing the accounting for certain mandatorily redeemable noncontrolling interests have been deferred indefinitely pending further fasb action 
this principally affects the way we account for minority interests in partnerships we control  the classification of such interests as liabilities  which we presently do  and accounting for changes in the fair value of the minority interest by a charge to earnings  which we currently do not do 
while the effect of this change would be dependent on the changes in the fair value of the partnerships net assets  it is possible that the future effects could be significant 
at year end  the difference between the carrying value of the minority interests and their estimated fair value was not significant 
during fourth quarter  fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
revised december  consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 
this interpretation provides guidance for determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity and which beneficiary of the variable interest entity  if any  should consolidate the variable interest entity 
this interpretation is required to be applied to all entities no later than the first period ending after march   except for special purpose entities to which it is required to be applied for the first period that ends after 
table of contents december  we have not yet completed the analysis to determine the effects on earnings or financial position of applying this interpretation but based on our current understanding  we do not expect the effects of adoption to be material 
the subsidiary we formed to conduct our accounts receivable securitization program is considered a special purpose entity and has been consolidated since its inception in we also adopted new rules related to the disclosure of information about our pension and postretirement plans 
in  we were required to adopt new rules for goodwill and other indefinitely lived intangible assets  including rules that precluded the amortization of goodwill  sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the cumulative effect of adopting this statement was to reduce net income by million or per diluted share for an million goodwill impairment associated with corrugated packaging pre acquisitions 
other new accounting pronouncements related to impairments of long lived assets held for use  the clarification of what constitutes an acquisition of a financial institution business and the treatment of costs associated with the early repayment of debt 
the effect on earnings or financial position of adopting these statements was not material 
pending accounting pronouncements during december  the securities and exchange commission staff announced it would soon release a staff accounting bulletin requiring interest rate lock commitments to be accounted for as written options and reported only as liabilities until they are exercised or expire  regardless of subsequent interest rate movements 
if the bulletin is released consistent with our current understanding  it would require us to change the way we account for interest rate lock commitments 
while the effects of this change would depend on the volume of interest rate lock commitments outstanding  it is likely that in periods of decreasing interest rates our earnings would decrease until loans funded under the interest rate lock commitments are sold  at which time our earnings would increase by a similar amount 
this change would not significantly affect our earnings in periods of increasing interest rates

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk interest rate risk our current level of interest rate risk is primarily due to an asset sensitive position in our financial services segment 
the following table illustrates the estimated effect on our pre tax income of immediate  parallel and sustained shifts in interest rates for the next months at year end  with comparative year end information 
this estimate considers the effects of changing prepayment speeds  repricing characteristics and average balances over the next months 
increase decrease in income before taxes year end year end change in parent financial parent financial interest rates company services company services in millions we did not present a two percent interest rate decrease scenario because of the current low interest rate environment 
the analysis assumes that debt reductions from contractual payments will be replaced with short term variable rate debt  however  that may not be the financing alternative we choose to follow 
our parent company long term debt is less sensitive to changes in interest rates because a substantial portion of it is at fixed rates 
our financial services segment is subject to interest rate risk to the extent interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities repay or reprice at different times or in differing amounts or both 
our financial services segment is in an asset sensitive position where the rate and prepayment characteristics of its assets are more responsive to changes in market interest rates than its liabilities 
in an asset sensitive position  earnings will generally be positively affected in a rising rate environment  but generally be negatively affected in a falling rate environment 
our financial service segment s interest rate sensitivity decreased in  principally because of changes in our earning asset mix  changes in our deposit base  and interest rate increases in the second half of 
table of contents our commercial real estate loans  which tend to reprice frequently  decreased billion  while our mortgage loans  which generally reprice after three to five years  increased billion 
additionally  approximately billion of deposits have shifted from certificates of deposit to interest bearing demand deposits  which generally reprice more frequently 
because of current market pricing of these deposit accounts  the sensitivity amounts at year end anticipate only limited repricing of those accounts in the one percent increase and decrease scenarios 
additionally  changes in interest rates affect the fair value of our mortgage servicing rights estimated at million at year end 
we estimate a one percent decline in long term fixed mortgage rates from current levels would decrease the fair value of the mortgage servicing rights by million 
foreign currency risk we do not have significant exposure to foreign currency fluctuations on our financial instruments because most of these instruments are denominated in us dollars 
commodity price risk from time to time we use commodity derivative instruments to mitigate our exposure to changes in product pricing and manufacturing costs 
these instruments cover a small portion of our volume and range in duration from three months to three years 
based on the fair value of these instruments at year end  the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical ten percent change in the underlying commodity prices would not be significant
