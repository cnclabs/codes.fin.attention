item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview heartland express  inc is a short to medium haul truckload carrier 
the company transports freight for major shippers and generally earns revenue based on the number of miles per load delivered 
during  freight revenue  excluding fuel surcharge  increased to million from million in the company takes pride in the quality of the service that it provides to its customers 
the keys to maintaining a high level of service are reliable equipment and equipment availability 
heartland has one of the newest fleets in the industry with an average tractor age of months and trailer age of months 
during the company purchased million in revenue equipment 
these purchases were financed through cash generated by operating activities  and the company expects future revenue equipment purchases to be financed using current cash and investment balances and cash flow provided by future operations 
the major challenge currently facing the trucking industry is the revised dot hours of service regulations that took effect on january  these changes could reduce the potential or practical amount of time that drivers can spend driving  if we are unable to limit their other on duty activities 
these changes could adversely affect our profitability if shippers are unwilling to assist in managing the drivers non driving activities  such as loading  unloading  and waiting 
a decline in driver productivity may require increases to driver pay to attract and retain qualified drivers 
in addition  the company may be required to increase the number of drivers that it employs and increase its fleet of revenue equipment to serve our current customer base and provide for future growth 
the full impact of these changes is not known at this time 
to retain drivers the company announced that in the first quarter of it is increasing pay for all drivers per mile 
management is also working with shippers to decrease the amount of non driving time per load 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
the company s management routinely makes judgments and estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
as the number of variables and assumptions affecting the probable future resolution of the uncertainties increase  these judgments become even more subjective and complex 
the company has identified certain accounting policies  described below  that are the most important to the portrayal of the company s current financial condition and results of operations 
the company s significant accounting policies are disclosed in item note  significant accounting policies of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the most significant accounting policies and estimates that affect the financial statements include the following revenue is recognized when freight is delivered 
selections of estimated useful lives and salvage values for purposes of depreciating tractors and trailers 
depreciable lives of tractors and trailers are and years  respectively 
estimates of salvage value are based upon the expected market values of equipment at the end of the expected useful life 
management estimates accruals for the self insured portion of pending accident liability  workers compensation  physical damage and cargo damage claims 
these accruals are based upon individual case estimates  including reserve development  and estimates of incurred but not reported losses based upon past experience 
management periodically re evaluates these estimates as events and circumstances change 
these factors may significantly impact the company s results of operations from period to period

the company s effective tax rate was in both and liquidity and capital resources the growth of the company s business requires significant investments in new revenue equipment 
historically the company has been debt free  funding revenue equipment purchases with cash flow provided by operations 
the company also obtains tractor capacity by utilizing independent contractors  who provide a tractor and bear all associated operating and financing expenses 
the company s primary source of liquidity for the year ended december   was net cash provided by operating activities of million compared to million in the corresponding period 
capital expenditures for property and equipment  net of trade ins  totaled million for the year during compared to million during in addition to purchasing revenue equipment  the company purchased terminal locations in columbus  ohio  olive branch  mississippi  chester  virginia  and carlisle  pennsylvania in the company purchased the business and trucking assets of great coastal express on june  for million 
the decrease in purchases of revenue equipment during is primarily due to the company increasing tractor purchases during to delay the business risk of buying tractors with engines that comply with the new epa emission standards 
management believes the company has adequate liquidity to meet its current and projected needs 
the company will continue to have significant capital requirements over the long term which are expected to be funded by cash flow provided by operations and from existing cash  cash equivalents  and investments 
the company ended the year with million in cash  cash equivalents  and investments and no debt 
based on the company s strong financial position  management believes outside financing could be obtained  if necessary  to fund capital expenditures 
factors that may affect future results the company s future results may be affected by a number of factors over which the company has little or no control 
fuel prices  insurance and claims costs  liability claims  interest rates  the availability of drivers  fluctuations in the resale value of revenue equipment  economic and customer business cycles and shipping demands are economic factors over which the company has little or no control 
significant increases or rapid fluctuations in fuel prices  interest rates or insurance and claims costs  to the extent not offset by increases in freight rates  and the resale value of revenue equipment could reduce the company s profitability 
weakness in the general economy  including a weakness in consumer demand for goods and services  could adversely affect the company s customers and the company s growth and revenues  if customers reduce their demand for transportation services 
customers encountering adverse economic conditions represent a greater potential for loss  and the company may be required to increase its reserve for bad debt losses 
weakness in customer demand for the company s services or in the general rate environment may also restrain the company s ability to increase rates or obtain fuel surcharges 
inflation and fuel cost most of the company s operating expenses are inflation sensitive  with inflation generally producing increased costs of operations 
during the past three years  the most significant effects of inflation have been on revenue equipment prices and the compensation paid to the drivers 
innovations in equipment technology and comfort have resulted in higher tractor prices  and there has been an industry wide increase in wages paid to attract and retain qualified drivers 
the company historically has limited the effects of inflation through increases in freight rates and certain cost control efforts 
in addition to inflation  fluctuations in fuel prices can affect profitability 
most of the company s contracts with customers contain fuel surcharge provisions 
although the company historically has been able to pass through most long term increases in fuel prices and operating taxes to customers in the form of surcharges and higher rates  shorter term increases are not fully recovered 
fuel prices have remained high throughout most of   and  thus increasing our cost of operations 
competitive conditions in the transportation industry  such as lower demand for transportation services  could affect the company s ability to obtain rate increases or fuel surcharges 
contractual obligations the impact that our contractual obligations as of december  are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods is as follows payments due by period less than total year years operating lease obligations    forward looking statements and risk factors statements in this report that are not reported financial results or other historical information are forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of such statements are based on present information the company has related to its existing business circumstances and involve a number of business risks and uncertainties  any of which could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward looking statements 
further  investors are cautioned that the company does not assume any obligation to update forward looking statements based on unanticipated events or changed expectations 
in addition to specific factors that may be described in connection with any particular forward looking statement  the following factors could cause actual results to differ materially 
growth with existing customers and the ability to solicit new business is dependent upon the company s ability to provide on time service and certain economic factors 
weakness in the economy  including decreased consumer demand  could adversely affect the demand for the company s transportation services and future growth 
the ability to negotiate increased freight rates to offset effects of inflation and cost increases is also dependent upon the state of the economy to a certain extent 
the company may also be affected by the financial failure of existing customers resulting in fewer shipments or potential bad debt write offs 
an extended period of economic downturn could also enhance revenue growth because of industry consolidation 
the truckload industry is highly competitive with an abundance of trucking companies  both profitable and marginal 
the business failures of the marginal competition may result in increased opportunities for the financially strong 
shortages of fuel and the resulting increase in the price of diesel can have an adverse impact on operations and profitability 
instability in the middle east and south america caused dramatic increases in the price of fuel in the second half of and throughout the company s operating results are negatively impacted to the extent that high fuel costs cannot be recovered through customer fuel surcharge agreements 
the company is subject to regulation by the dot  epa  and various other federal and state authorities 
new or more comprehensive regulations pertaining to fuel emissions  driver hours of service  or other mandated regulation could result in increased cost of operations 
in addition  increased taxes and operating fees mandated by federal and state taxing authorities can have an adverse effect on profitability 
effective october  all newly manufactured engines must comply with emission standards mandated by the epa 
truck engines manufactured prior to october  are not subject to the new emission standards 
the company does not intend to make significant purchases of tractors with epa compliant engines until adequate testing by the manufacturers has been completed 
the pricing  engine life  maintenance cost  and fuel efficiency of the new engine could have an impact on the company s operating expenses 
the company s operation is highly dependent on the hiring and retention of experienced drivers with safe driving records 
there has been a shortage of qualified drivers and independent contractors over the past several years 
the availability of company employed drivers improved in primarily due to industry consolidation caused by the business failures of marginal competitors 
however  the availability of independent contractors has declined due to high fuel prices and the decreased availability of tractor financing 
the company expects that the hiring of qualified drivers will remain competitive 
a shortage of qualified drivers and independent contractors for an extended period of time could effect the growth and operating results of the company 
the company is a party to ordinary  routine litigation and administrative proceedings incidental to its business 
these proceedings primarily involve claims for personal injury and property damage incurred in connection with the transportation of freight 
the company maintains insurance to cover liabilities arising from the transportation of freight for amounts in excess of certain self insured retentions 
claims in excess of these retentions are covered by premium based policies to levels that management considers adequate 
in recent years the cost of insurance in the industry has increased dramatically due to increased claims and economic conditions 
the company s current insurance policies expire in increases in premiums and self retention levels could impact the results of operations 
new accounting pronouncements see note of the consolidated financial statements for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements and the respective expected dates of adoption and effects on results of operations and financial position 
item a

primarily all investments as of december  have an original maturity or interest reset date of six months or less 
due to the short term nature of the investments the company is exposed to minimal market risk related to its cash equivalents and investments 
the company has no debt outstanding as of december  and therefore  has no market risk related to debt 
as of december   the company has no derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure to diesel fuel price fluctuations
