forward looking statements this report and the documents incorporated by referenced herein contain forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
forward looking statements are any statements that are not based on historical information 
statements other than statements of historical facts included in this report  including  without limitation  statements regarding fpu s future financial position  business strategy  budgets  projected costs and plans and objectives of management for future operations  are forward looking statements 
forward looking statements generally can be identified by the use of forward looking terminology such as may  will  expect  anticipate   intend  plan  believe  seek  estimate or continue or the negative of such words or variations of such words and similar expressions 
these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks  uncertainties and assumptions  which are difficult to predict 
therefore  actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in such forward looking statements and fpu can give no assurance that such forward looking statements will prove to be correct 
important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward looking statements  or cautionary statements  include  but are not limited to  weather conditions  changes in laws or regulations  changes in the market environment  restrictions on fpu s ability to raise capital on fa vorable terms  any direct or indirect effects of terrorist threats and activities  fpu s successfully petitioning for and receiving rate increases  fpu s ability to identify attractive acquisition opportunities at favorable prices and to successfully and timely complete and integrate them 
overview fpu is organized into two regulated business segments  natural gas and electric  and one non regulated business segment  propane gas 
fpu s two regulated business segments are regulated by the florida public service commission fpsc 
as part of this regulation  the fpsc set the rates fpu is permitted to charge to its customers 
the rates approved by the fpsc allow fpu a specified rate of return on its regulated investment and to pass through to its customers changes in the costs of its gas and electricity and  in some cases  certain of fpu s overhead costs 
the fpsc previously viewed fpu as operating three distinct regulated entities i northwest florida electric  ii northeast florida electric and iii natural gas  which includes palm beach county and the sanford and deland area in central florida 
accordingly  the fpsc formerly required that fpu file three separate rate cases with the fpsc in order to recover through rate relief the effects of inflation and construction expenditures for all such entities 
on august   fpu filed for electric rate increases and petitioned to consolidate the two electric entities into one 
the request included recovery for recent increases to certain operating expenses  including pension and insurance expenses  of approximately million 
fpu went before the fpsc on february   at which time the fpsc granted the petition to consolidate the rate cases on a going forward basis and granted a million increase in revenue 
the effective date for the increase was march  fpu is planning to file a request for natural gas rate relief with the fpsc in the summer of fpu will include in the filing recovery of million for environmental liabilities included on the balance sheet in other assets  other regulatory assets environmental  along with recovery of certain expense increases 
in addition  fpu has requested approval from the fpsc for inclusion in the rate base of the goodwill and intangible assets associated with its acquisition of atlantic utilities 
the fpsc has not ruled on the appropriate treatment of the goodwill and intangible assets and has requested that fpu re address this issue in the filing for natural gas rate relief in prior to these rate increases  fpu last received rate increases for the northwest florida electric division in february  for the northeast florida electric division in november and for the natural gas segment in may on march   fpu sold certain assets comprising its former water utility system to the city of fernandina beach city 
the city paid fpu million in cash at closing and agreed to pay future consideration of approximately million to be paid in annual installments until february  the net proceeds from the sale received at closing were used to pay down short term bank debt 
fpu recognized and recorded the present value of the long term receivable of million  using a discount rate of 
the long term receivable has been subsequently increased to recognize interest income of approximately  the fair value of the consideration is approximately million 
the gain on the disposal of discontinued operations  including the income from discontinued operations for the first quarter of  was million  or mil lion after tax  and has subsequently been adjusted to million  or million after tax  due to adjustments to sales related expenses that were previously estimated 
the assets of the water segment amount to approximately million  or less than of fpu s assets including water 
for the year ended december   the water segment s operating income before income taxes was approximately of total operating income before income taxes 
fpu s strategy is to concentrate on developing stronger relationships with its customers  including builders and developers 
fpu is positioning itself as a total energy company  not just a supplier of electricity or gas 
included in the strategy is a plan to increase the rate of future growth by concentrating on increasing customers and territory coverage using improved marketing programs  along with acquiring small energy related companies  particularly propane gas companies 
in  two acquisitions added approximately  customers 
during  fpu made another acquisition comprising less than of its assets  which added approximately  customers 
the cost of each of these acquisitions was less than of fpu s assets and they provide less than of fpu s revenues and operating income excluding income taxes 
pension expenses are projected to continue increasing into and current actuarial estimates show pension expense increasing by approximately  in over fpu allocates its pension and other overhead expenses across its three operating segments 
the expenses relating to natural gas and electricity should be recovered in the rate proceedings with the fpsc  although further increases in and thereafter would require future rate increase requests to be filed with the fpsc 
recovery of the expense allocated to the propane gas segment will depend on current market conditions in the propane industry 
provided the increases experienced are industry wide  fpu anticipates the ability to increase rates to recover the expenses while remaining competitive 
recent industry events along with the threat of terrorism and continued increases in medical costs have resulted in increased insurance expenses 
in  medical insurance costs increased approximately  liability insurance  including workers compensation  increased approximately  these costs are expected to remain at this level in and will most likely increase in fpu made revisions to its medical plan and is seeking rate relief in both the natural gas and electric segments to recover a majority of the effect of the plan on operating income 
future insurance increases may require additional rate increase requests to be filed with the fpsc 
results of operations discussion of operating results please note that water has been excluded from operating results and is classified as discontinued operations 
see discontinued operations in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
gross profit gross profit is defined as gross operating revenues less fuel costs  conservation and unbundling costs  and taxes based on revenues that are passed through to customers 
fpu believes that gross profit provides a more meaningful basis for evaluating utility operations than gross operating revenues because fuel  conservation and unbundling costs along with taxes passed through to customers have no effect on results of operations and fluctuations in such costs distort the relationship of gross operating revenues between periods 
gross profit is the net revenue retained by fpu for operating purposes 
gross profits dollars in thousands year ended december  natural gas electric propane gas contributing to variations in gross profit are the effects of seasonal weather conditions  the timing of rate increases  acquisitions and the migration of winter residents and tourists to florida during the winter season 
natural gas natural gas gross profit increased million  or  in gross profit increased primarily due to a non recurring early termination fee of million received from lake worth generation llc for the cancellation of a contract in late march fpu negotiated a new contract with the city of lake worth which resulted in a reduction of annual revenue by  compared to the previous contract 
approximately  of the increase in gross profit was attributable to an increase in residential and commercial customer sales 
overall  average customers increased in by due to normal growth  although this was offset by a decrease in usage per customer  most likely due to milder weather and a higher costs of gas 
revenue associated with fpu s area expansion program added  relating to carrying charges for construction charges that are due from customers 
late fee reve nue increased by  natural gas gross profit increased million  or  in  primarily due to fpu s acquisition of a natural gas company and a pipeline contract with a lake worth generation facility that added over million of gross profit 
transportation sales increased  in  primarily due to a new unbundling program that allows commercial customers to purchase their own natural gas 
as a result  fpu added new transportation customers  an increase of over 
however  these increases were primarily attributable to commercial customers transferring to transportation service  and were offset by fewer commercial customers and lower sales 
revenue also increased by over  due to late payment fees and charges for reconnecting services 
overall  average customers increased and units sold increased  both due to the acquisitions and normal growth 
 the increases in units sold from normal growth and acquisitions were offset by decreases in units sold per customer 
electric electric gross profit increased  or  in  primarily due to an increase in late fees of  gross profits improved despite a decrease in revenues of million  or  in the decrease in revenues was due to a decrease in the costs of fuel  which are typically passed on to customers 
customer growth was up due to normal growth 
this growth was offset by a decline in usage per customer most likely due to milder weather 
electric gross profit increased  in this was attributed to average customer growth of along with a increase in units sold excluding general service large demand gsld customers 
gsld customers are commercial or industrial customers who pay on both usage and demand due to the higher service requirements 
higher units sold per customer along with the growth in customers contributed to a increase in sales in this increase was offset by a  reduction in gross profit due a recording of potential over earnings in the earnings were subject to review by the fpsc  and in  the fpsc granted fpu permission to use the over earnings to increase its storm damage reserves 
propane gas propane gas gross profit increased  or  in primarily due to the acquisition of a propane gas company in late and the construction and sale of two storage tanks at a lake worth high school  which attributed to  of the increase 
an increase in late fees and the assessment of regulatory compliance fees beginning in the first quarter of for propane gas customers also contributed to the increase 
these increases were offset by refinement of an estimate for propane gas inventory held at customer premises in the third quarter 
in addition  the gross profit per unit sold decreased as fpu elected to reduce the profit margin for some customers in an effort to remain competitive 
the number of customers increased by primarily due to the acquisition  and usage per customer increased 
propane gas gross profit increased in by million  or  primarily due to two acquisitions 
average customers increased by and units sold increased 
revenues increased due to colder weather in december operating expenses excluding income taxes operating expenses  which include operations and taxes other than income taxes  exclude fuel costs  conservation and unbundling costs  and taxes based on revenues that are passed through to customers 
these expenses have no effect on results of operations as they are passed on through revenue and fluctuations in such costs distort the relationship of operating expenses between periods 
these costs are grouped on a separate line of the income statement as cost of fuel and taxes based on revenues 
operating expenses excluding income taxes dollars in thousands year ended december  natural gas electric propane gas natural gas natural gas operating expenses  excluding income taxes  increased million  or  in administrative expenses increased  and are discussed separately in the administrative expenses section 
other operating expense increased  partially due to an increase in underground natural gas line location expense of  that was caused by an increase in the quantity of natural gas line locations performed due to construction related projects 
other contributing factors to the increase include higher depreciation expense of  and an increase of  in maintenance expenses in the first quarter related to an abandoned construction project for a main insertion failure at royal park bridge in south florida 
these increases were offset by the collection of an expected bad debt of  related to the contract with lake worth generation in the first quarter of natural gas operating expenses  excluding income taxes  increased million  or  in administrative expenses increased  and are discussed separately in the administrative expenses section 
the increase in was also caused by an increase in customer administration expenses due to higher bad debt expense and payroll 
fpu increased collection efforts to reduce bad debt expense by focusing on collections and the adequacy of deposits 
distribution expenses also increased because of more line locations and an increase in the cost per location by the contractor 
other factors contributing to the increase for are increased depreciation expense of  and increased taxes other than income taxes mainly consisting of payroll and property taxes of  both primarily attributable to an asset acquisition in electric electric operating expenses  excluding income taxes  increased  or  in administrative costs  discussed below in more detail  increased  customer accounts expense increased  due mostly to uncollectible accounts of  and temporary staffing of  depreciation and maintenance expenses increased  and  respectively  due to increases in plant assets 
electric operating expenses  excluding income taxes  increased  or  in administrative costs  discussed below in more detail  increased  maintenance expenses decreased  primarily due to additional expense for substation work  transmission line access work and overhead line balancing in the prior year 
propane gas propane gas operating expenses  excluding income taxes  increased  or  in administrative expenses  discussed below  increased  and other operating expenses increased  primarily due to the acquisition of a company in late depreciation expense also increased  due to increases in plant assets 
propane gas operating expenses  excluding income taxes  increased million  or  in administrative expenses  discussed below  increased  payroll for operating and maintenance expenses increased  and depreciation expense increased  the increases in payroll for operating and maintenance expenses and depreciation expense were caused primarily by acquisitions of propane gas companies in and administrative expenses administrative expenses increased million  or  in this increase was primarily caused by an increase in insurance expense of  caused by higher medical costs and increased premiums for worker s compensation and general liability 
the increase in premiums resulted from increased payroll and higher insurance rates 
pension expense increased  primarily as a result of the overall impact from the stock market decreases in and additionally  other outside services increased approximately  mostly due to sarbanes oxley compliance  which required increased accounting related services  including internal auditing services to evaluate and improve fpu s procedures and internal controls 
fpu also began utilizing additional outside tax related services in administrative expenses for increased million  or 
increased claims for general liability and medical self insurance resulted in increased expenses of  and  respectively 
workers compensation expense also increased  as a result of increased payroll and slightly higher rates 
pension expense increased  primarily as a result of the overall decline in the stock market 
insurance premiums also increased  primarily in the latter part of  contributing to the overall administrative expense increase 
in addition  outside services increased as a result of a new internal audit program to help fpu meet the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act 
this new program increased expenses for the year by  other increases in outside services relating to accounting fees accounted for an additional increase of  misce llaneous administrative expenses increased as a direct result of expensing  of costs associated with a stock offering that was not consummated 
interest charges and other interest charges interest charges consist of interest on bonds  short term borrowings and customer deposits 
in  total interest charges decreased  interest on short term borrowings decreased  as a result of the decrease in notes payable  offset by a decrease in interest on the allowance for funds used during construction of  as a result of completing a generation pipeline in interest on long term debt in increased million due to two additional bonds issued in september and november of totaling million 
the bonds were primarily used to finance acquisitions  fund a major lake worth generation pipeline project and to reduce fpu s short term debt 
the offsetting decrease in short term debt interest charges was other other consists of income and expense from fpu s merchandise and services  gains or losses on disposal of property and other miscellaneous income or deductions 
fpu s merchandise and services activities include the sale of merchandise  installation and other contract work 
merchandise and service profitability decreased approximately  in due to changes in marketing personnel that resulted in decreased focus on merchandise sales and product knowledge 
other income decreased approximately   of which was due to an adjustment required by the fpsc reclassifying interest income to the liability reserve 
in  fpu sold non utility property for a gain of  further reducing the amount of expense in compared to merchandise and service revenue and expenses both increased in  primarily due to the gas division s conservation program that offers rebates to customers for gas merchandise purchases 
profitability has decreased due to increased costs of installing piping and servicing of appliances 
the south florida merchandise revenue remained relatively flat due to the effects of road construction outside of the sales facility 
as discussed previously  fpu sold substantially all of the assets of its water division to the city of fernandina beach on march  the sale was made pursuant to a threat of condemnation during the fourth quarter of fpu has elected for tax purposes to defer the gain on the sale of the assets pursuant to code section of the internal revenue code of irc 
section allows nonrecognition of gain if property is disposed as a result of threat of condemnation and property that is similar or related in service or use is purchased to replace the property disposed 
to qualify  the replacement property must be purchased within the replacement period which begins on the earlier of date of disposition march  or date of threat of condemnation december  and ending two years after the close of the year of sale december  
for r eal property  the replacement period is extended to three years december  
fpu intends to purchase property that is similar or related in service or use within the replacement period 
in the first  second and third quarter  the related deferred tax liability was included in current taxes 
as of year end  it is included in deferred taxes payable 
liquidity and capital resources portions of fpu s business are seasonal  and accordingly  short term debt is used to meet working capital requirements primarily during periods of lower sales 
fpu also borrows under lines of credit to finance portions of its capital expenditures and acquisitions  pending refinancing at a later date through the issuance of equity or long term debt  depending upon prevailing market conditions 
on march   fpu received million in cash  along with future consideration valued at million discounted to present value for the sale of its water division for additional information see discontinued operations in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in april  fpu retired an expiring million line of credit 
the line of credit had a million outstanding balance on march   that was repaid using proceeds from the sale of the water division 
on april   fpu obtained a new million  thirty nine month line of credit loc that matures on june  as of december   the outstanding balance on the loc is million 
fpu reserves million of the loc to cover expenses for any major storm repairs in its northwest florida division 
an additional  of the loc is reserved for a letter of credit insuring propane facilities 
the lower credit line and change of banks resulted from a more restrictive banking environment in  as compared to when the expiring credit line was established 
due to the current business environment  fpu will not be as leveraged in as it was in the prior three years 
notes payable  long term debt and preferred stock on december  comprised of total capitalization  with common stock equity of  whereas such securities comprised o f total capitalization with of common stock equity as of december  the stronger equity ratio was a result of the sale of the water assets for a million gain  net of income taxes 
construction expenditures are budgeted at approximately million in  which will include system upgrades to electric facilities 
in  million was spent on construction that related mostly to system expansions and replacements 
the amount was lower than the million spent in primarily due to a million contribution received in due to the early termination of a contract with lake worth generation  llc which  for accounting purposes  was treated as a reduction in construction expenditures  and approximately million of additional construction in relating to the lake worth generation project 
in  million of capital expenditures included million to begin construction of the gas line to the generation facility 
fpu currently has no material commitments for construction expenditures 
additional financing of approximately million will be needed to finance projected construction in without additional financing  the system upgrades would be deferred 
based on fpu s current financing structure and business environment  it is likely the additional financing will be provided by the issuance of equity in this disclosure does not constitute an offer of any securities of fpu for sale 
fpu anticipates capital expenditure requirements for of million 
the equity issuance expected in  along with the capital resulting from normal operations  will be sufficient to fund these expenditures 
net cash flow provided by continuing operating activities decreased slightly from fluctuations in the discontinued operations income  deferred income taxes  and accounts payable were mostly related to the sale of the water division 
in  fpu had funds classified as restricted proceeds from the private activity bond acquired in late as construction progressed  the balance of these restricted proceeds decreased  and was fully unrestricted in on july   fpu affected a four for three stock split to the record holders of june  in the form of a stock dividend 
all information related to the common stock has been restated to reflect the stock split 
long term debt has sinking fund payments that begin in lines of credit are generally for three years and are renewed at that time 
discontinued operations water service on march   fpu sold certain assets comprising its former water utility system to the city of fernandina beach city 
the city paid fpu million in cash at closing and agreed to pay future consideration of approximately million to be paid in installments summarized below until february  the net proceeds from the sale received at closing were used to repay the outstanding balances of notes payable to a bank 
fpu recognized and recorded the present value of the long term receivable of million  using a discount rate of 
the long term receivable has been subsequently increased to recognize interest income of  the fair value of the consideration is approximately million 
the gain on the disposal of discontinued operations  including the income from discontinued operations for the first quarter of  was million  or million after tax  and has subsequently been adjusted to million  or million after tax  due to adjustments to sales related expenses that were previously estimated 
the assets of the water segment amount to approximately million  or less than of fpu s assets including water 
the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been restated for all periods presented for the discontinued operations of the water division

under this statement  the amortization of goodwill is no longer permitted and intangible assets with an indefinite life will not be amortized 
the standard requires goodwill to be periodically tested for impairment and written down to fair value if considered impaired 
the reporting segments subject to impairment testing are propane gas and natural gas 
intangible assets associated with fpu s acquisitions have been identified and are shown as separate line items on the balance sheet 
balances as of december  have been reclassified to conform to this presentation 
the intangibles subject to amortization over a five year period are non compete agreements totaling  the related amortization of  is included in the net intangible on the balance sheet 
the remaining intangibles identified are customer distribution rights of million and customer relationships of  both of which have indefinite lives and are not subject to amortization 
all goodwill relates to the natural and propane gas acquisitions and accordingly  there is no amortization of goodwill reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
goodwill is million in the natural gas segment and million in the propane gas segment 
the initial test for goodwill impairment was performed for the reporting segments as of january  and the test results showed no impairment for either operating segment 
a subsequent impairment test was performed as of january  and showed no impairment for either reporting segment 
off balance sheet arrangements fpu does not use off balance sheet financing  have minority interests in businesses  engage in energy trading activities  or make loans or guarantee loans to executives or directors 
all debt of fpu is reflected on the balance sheet 
bond related issues fpu s indenture of mortgage and deed of trust  which is a mortgage on all real and personal property  permits the issuance of additional bonds based upon a calculation of unencumbered net real and personal property 
at december   such calculation would permit the issuance of approximately million of additional bonds 
fpu issued its first mortgage bond series due on september   in the aggregate principal amount of million as security for the secured insured quarterly notes  due october  iq notes 
interest on the pledged bond accrues at the rate of per annum payable quarterly in arrears on january  april  july and october of each year  and payable initially on january  the pledged bond constitutes the fourteenth series of fpu s first mortgage bonds

 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
the statement requires that the fair value of an asset retirement obligation be recognized at the time those obligations are incurred 
upon initial recognition of a legal liability  costs are capitalized as part of the related long lived asset and allocated to expense over the useful life of the asset 
sfas no 
also requires that components of previously recorded depreciation related to the cost of removal of assets upon retirement  whether legal asset retirement obligations or not  be removed from a company s accumulated depreciation reserve 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  fpu adopted the provisions of the statement as of january   as prescribed by the fpsc 
under fpsc guidelines  the estimated cost of removal e xpenses for normal retirements related to regulated fixed assets were reserved through the depreciation expense and accumulated reserves 
this was disclosed in a footnote until december   when fpu also reclassified the estimated cost of removal from accumulated depreciation to a regulatory liability for the obligation 
the estimated value of the reserve that has been accumulated for future cost of removal as of december  and was approximately million and million  respectively 
all prior period amounts have been restated to conform to the current year presentation 
financial accounting standard no 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement clarifies the circumstances under which a contract with an initial net investment becomes a derivative  and clarifies when a derivative contains a financing component 
as fpu has designated all material contracts meeting the definition of possible derivative instruments as normal purchases and sales under sfas no 
 accounting for derivatives  this statement had no impact on the current financial statements issued by fpu but could impact future financial statements 
financial accounting standard no 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  this statement establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability or an asset in some circumstances 
many of those instruments were previously classified as equity 
sfas no 
had no impact on current financial instruments issued by fpu  but could impact future financial instruments issued by fpu 
other critical accounting policies and estimates rate regulated basis of accounting fpu prepares its financial statements in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation sfas no 
and it is fpu s most critical accounting policy 
in general  sfas no 
recognizes that accounting for rate regulated enterprises should reflect the relationship of costs and revenues introduced by rate regulation 
as a result  a regulated utility may defer recognition of a cost a regulatory asset or recognize an obligation a regulatory liability if it is probable that  through the rate making process  there will be a corresponding increase or decrease in revenues 
sfas no 
does not apply to the unregulated propane gas operations 
use of estimates inherent in the accounting process is the use of estimates when preparing financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
fpu uses estimates in the preparation of its financial statements including the accrual for pensions  environmental liabilities  and uninsured liability claims 
an actuary calculates the estimated pension liability in accordance with fasb environmental liabilities are subject to certain unknown future events 
fpu is self insured for the first  of each general and auto liability claim and therefore accrues for estimated losses occurring from both asserted and unasserted claims 
the estimate for unasserted claims arising from unreported incidents is based on an analysis of historical claims data and judgmen t 
fpu became fully insured for medical in december and will no longer require accrual of estimated claims 
management believes that the accruals for potential liabilities are adequate 
revenue recognition fpu bills utility customers on a monthly cycle basis  however  the billing cycle periods for most customers do not coincide with the accounting periods used for financial reporting 
fpu accrues estimated revenue for gas and electric customers not yet billed during the accounting period 
determination of unbilled revenue relies on the use of estimates  fuel purchases  and historical data 
effects of inflation fpu s tariffs associated with its utility operating divisions provide for fuel clauses through which rates charged to customers are adjusted for changes in the cost of fuel on a reasonably current basis 
increases in other utility costs and expenses not otherwise offset by increases in revenues or reductions in other expenses could have an adverse effect on earnings due to the time lag associated with obtaining regulatory approval to recover such increased costs and expenses  the uncertainty of whether regulatory commissions will allow full recovery of such increased costs and expenses  and any effect on unregulated propane gas operations 
environmental matters fpu currently uses or used in the past  in connection with its operations  several contamination sites with respect to which there is now pending or threatened environmental litigation and is in the process of investigating and assessing that litigation  see contingen cies in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
fpu intends to vigorously defend its rights in this litigation 
fpu has insurance to cover a portion of any losses or expenses incurred as a result of this litigation and plans to apply to the fpsc for rate relief on any uninsured losses or expenses 
fpu believes that the aggregate of all future contamination assessment and remedial costs  legal fees and other related expenses will not exceed the combined sum of any insurance proceeds received and any rate relief granted 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk all financial instruments held by fpu were entered into for purposes other than for trading 
fpu has market risk exposure only from the potential loss in fair value resulting from changes in interest rates 
fpu has no material exposure relating to commodity prices because fpu  under its regulatory jurisdictions  is fully compensated for the actual costs of commodities natural gas and electricity used in its operations 
any commodity price increases for propane gas are normally passed through monthly to propane gas customers as the fuel charge portion of their rate 
this can be performed due to the competition having similar increases that are customarily passed through to their customers 
none of fpu s gas or electric contracts are accounted for using the fair value method of accounting 
while some of fpu s contracts meet the definition of a derivative  fpu has designated these contracts as normal purchases and sales under sfas no 
 accounting for derivatives 
fpu s long term receivable non interest bearing from the sale of the water operations was discounted at 
a hypothetical basis points increase in the interest rate used would change the current fair value from million to million 
fpu has no exposure to equity risk  as it does not hold any equity instruments 
fpu s exposure to interest rate risk is limited to investments held for environmental costs and short term borrowings on the line of credit 
these investments are fixed income debt securities whose carrying amounts are not materially different than fair value 
such investments mature through and are expected to be held to maturity 
therefore  fpu does not believe it has material market risk exposure related to these instruments
