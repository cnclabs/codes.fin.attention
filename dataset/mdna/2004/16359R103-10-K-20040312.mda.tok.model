as a result of these write downs  the carrying values of all intangibles for the service america segment have been reduced to nil 
the goodwill impairment charges are based on an appraisal firm s valuation of service america s business as of december  and the fair value of service america was calculated using an average of the enterprise value determined under a capital markets valuation and discounted cash flows using updated income and cash flow projections for service america s business 
the capital markets method calculates an enterprise value based on valuations at which comparable businesses sold in the capital markets and based on certain financial ratios and statistics 
the income and cash flow projections are updated each year as a part of the company s annual business plan process and take into consideration the changing marketplace and changing operating conditions

the decline in plumbing and drain cleaning s hvac repair and maintenance revenues was attributable to the company s decision in to exit this line of business

as of december   medic one had not cured the violations or obtained a waiver for such violations 
despite the fact that medic one reported positive income from operations in and  it would apparently be unable to continue operations without the continued forbearance of debt covenant violations 
if medic one s lender called its debt  it is likely that medic one would be forced into bankruptcy or forced liquidation 
in such circumstances  the possibility that the company could recover any significant portion of its investment is considered small

the company s third party administrator tpa processes claims on behalf of the company and reviews claims on a monthly basis 
currently  the company s exposure on any single claim is capped at  for most of the years prior to  the caps for general liability and workers compensation were  per claim 
in developing its estimates  the company accumulates historical claims data for the previous years to calculate loss development factors ldf by insurance coverage type 
ldfs are applied to known claims to estimate the ultimate potential liability for known and unknown claims for each open policy year 
prior to  the ldfs were updated every three years and reviewed by the company s outside professional actuaries for reasonableness in view of the company s claims experience and insurance industry trends 
beginning in  ldfs will be updated annually 
the current ldfs were last updated as of march and will next be updated in march because this methodology relies heavily on historical claims data  the key risk is whether the historical claims are an accurate predictor of future claims exposure 
the risk also exists that certain claims have been incurred and not reported on a timely basis 
to mitigate these risks  the company  in conjunction with its tpa  closely monitors claims to ensure timely accumulation of data and compares its claims trends with the industry experience of its tpa 
as an indication of the sensitivity of the accrued liability to reported claims  the company s analysis indicates that a across the board increase or decrease in the amount of reported claims would increase or decrease the accrued insurance liability at december   by or  investments equity investments with readily determinable fair values are recorded at their fair values 
other equity investments are recorded at cost  subject to write down for impairment 
the company regularly reviews its investments for impairment 
as a result of this review  in the fourth quarter of  the company reduced the carrying value of its investment in the redeemable preferred stock of medic one from its original cost of  to nil 
medic one  a privately held provider of ambulance and wheelchair transportation services  is in violation of certain covenants under a line of credit that expired in november the lender has not waived such violations and has the right to call the debt 
if the debt were called  medic one could be forced into bankruptcy 
the company also has a patient care common stock purchase warrant pc warrant for the purchase of up to of privately held patient care 
the pc warrant has a carrying value of  which was its estimated fair value on the date of issuance in october patient care s operating results for have declined from levels  but patient care remains profitable and paid down significant amounts of bank debt in the company views this investment as a long term investment and believes any decline in the fair value of the pc warrant is not other than temporary as of december  nonetheless  market conditions could change in the coming year and cause the company to reassess its valuation of this investment 
equity investment vitas the company s investment in vitas common stock exceeds its share of vitas net book value by approximately million 
on a preliminary basis  the company estimated that million of this excess is attributable to the excess value o f computer software with a five year life and the remainder to goodwill with an indefinite life 
amortization of this excess reduced the company s equity in the earnings of vitas by  in in  as a result of completing the acquisition of the of vitas it did not own in  the company will conduct a thorough review to value all assets and liabilities of vitas at their fair values 
this  it is possible that the company will identify other intangible assets with different useful lives 
goodwill the company annually tests the goodwill balances of its reporting units for impairment using appraisals performed by a valuation firm 
the valuation of each reporting unit is dependent upon many factors  some of which are market driven and beyond the company s control 
the valuations of goodwill for the company s roto rooter services and roto rooter franchising and products reporting units indicate that the fair value of goodwill for each of these units exceeds its respective book value by a significant amount 
the valuations of service america in and reduced goodwill for this reporting unit to nil 
critical accounting policies related to vitas allowance for uncollectible accounts vitas net revenue is reported at the estimated net realizable amounts due from third party payors  primarily medicare and medicaid 
payors may deny payment for services in whole or in part on the basis that such services are not eligible for coverage and do not qualify for reimbursement 
vitas management estimates denials each period and makes adequate provision for them in its financial statements 
due to the complexity of the laws and regulations affecting the medicare and medicaid programs  estimates can and do change by material amounts in future periods 
vitas receives biweekly payments for patient services from the medicare program under the prospective interim payment pip system 
these payments are subsequently applied against specific medicare accounts as claims are processed by the fiscal intermediary

the company maintains contractual relationships with certain independent contractors to provide plumbing and drain cleaning services in specified territories primarily using the roto rooter name 
the company has no equity interest in any of the independent contractors  but in many cases  loans money to the contractor to assist in financing equipment and working capital needs 
the loans are generally partially secured by the contractors equipment and are guaranteed by the business owner 
the company s contractor agreements do not require its contractors to provide all the financial information necessary to apply the provisions of fin no 
r to its contractors 
furthermore  the contractors generally have not provided all the financial data they are required to provide under the contractor agreements 
the company evaluated its contractual relationships with the four independent contractors that commenced operations in contractors and determined they are potentially subject to consolidation under fin no

or fin no 
r  would materially impact its operating results 
instead  consolidation of some  if any  of these arrangements is more likely to result in a grossing up of amounts  such as revenues and expenses  with little or no net change to the company s net income or cash flows
