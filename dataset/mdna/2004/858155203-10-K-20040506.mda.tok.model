overview the office furniture industry has experienced about a decline in shipments over the past three years in the united states  as reported by the business and institutional furniture manufacturer s association bifma international 
in response to this decline  we implemented several operational  organizational and financial restructuring activities including plant rationalizations and workforce reductions 
through these actions we have reduced our cost structure significantly  but not enough to offset the dramatic decline in revenue  therefore  we reported losses in and revenue declined annually in  in and in our acquisitions of polyvision corporation and custom cable industries  both completed in the second half of fiscal  contributed to our total revenue in  in and in the dealer transition completed during contributed to our total revenue in and in 
table of contents revenue in benefited by from favorable currency translation in the company s international segment when compared to revenue 
revenue in benefited from an extra week in the fourth quarter  which we estimate added in revenue 
although there appears to be an overall economic recovery underway in the united states  we believe the lack of sustained job growth has delayed a similar recovery for the office furniture industry 
there has been some recent improvement in united states job growth  which if continued  could be an important driver for renewed growth in our united states markets in the coming year 
many of our major international markets are not showing signs of growth and may lag a united states recovery 
gross margins declined to of revenue in because of higher cost of sales and increased restructuring costs 
cost of sales increased to of sales in primarily because of underabsorption of fixed overhead 
our efforts to consolidate operations and reduce excess capacity are having an impact  but not quickly enough to offset the decline in volume 
additionally  intense competition for project business increased product discounts in all markets during the second half of the year 
in the north america segment alone  higher discounts decreased revenue and thus gross margins by nearly compared to the restructuring costs related to the consolidation activity described above were or of revenue  a significant increase in these charges versus the prior year 
we expect to continue to incur restructuring charges related to manufacturing operations as we continue to take steps to transform our industrial model 
however  the cost of these activities in is expected to be less than in we expect additional plant consolidation activity in  though not at the same level as in we also expect to continue to expand implementation of lean manufacturing principles in our plants 
operating expenses declined significantly in despite a unfavorable currency translation effect 
operating expenses were also lower as a percent of revenue 
these reductions reflect the savings from restructuring activities  including headcount reductions  which took place in the current and prior years 
current year restructuring costs related to operating expenses were  a significant decrease compared to the prior year  because the number of salaried workforce reductions was lower in in total  we recorded net pre tax operating charges for restructuring items totaling in  in and in the net charges in consisted of in severance charges for workforce reductions completed or underway and in other restructuring charges  primarily for asset impairments 
we also recorded a net pre tax gain of  of which was included in non operating items  net  primarily for gains on the sale of real estate and a curtailment gain related to our post retirement medical and pension benefit plans 
the net charges in consisted of in severance charges for workforce reductions and in other restructuring charges  primarily for business exit costs 
other items recorded in totaling a net pre tax gain of  of which was included in non operating items  net  were primarily for gains on the sale of real estate and a curtailment gain related to our post retirement medical and pension benefit plans 
see further discussion and detail of all these items in the segment disclosure analysis below and in note and note to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents during q  we recorded of favorable tax adjustments  which are included in the income tax benefit in the table above 
these adjustments consisted of two items 
based on the results of a recently completed irs tax audit  we recorded a net adjustment of reversing reserves that were no longer necessary related to the years that were audited 
as of february   we feel the level of remaining reserves appropriately reflects our probable income tax exposures 
in addition  we recorded a favorable adjustment to income tax expense related to the q review of the annual tax provision and related liability 
although our effective tax rate for relating to continuing operations is calculated to be  we expect our long term effective tax rate to remain between and 
as mentioned in the general section of part i  item  during q  we sold substantially all of the net assets of our marine hardware and accessories business 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the operating results of this business have been segregated as discontinued operations for all periods presented

 goodwill and other intangible assets 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding goodwill and other intangible assets 
in february  we initiated a change in our participative control of eight dealers where we hold a majority position in the voting stock 
accordingly  we consolidated the balance sheets of these dealers as of february  the consolidation of these dealers had the effect of increasing our total assets and liabilities by there was no effect on equity as we previously accounted for these dealers as equity investments on our balance sheets 
the results of operations of these dealers will be included in our consolidated results beginning in q we expect these newly consolidated dealers will add approximately to of revenue in  with no corresponding impact on net income because we either do not share in the earnings or  where we do share in the earnings  we previously accounted for the dealer under the equity method of accounting and our share of the earnings were included within other income expense  net 
market prices for steel have risen up to over the past several months due to unprecedented changes in global supply and demand 
we did not experience any material effect of the rise in these prices during because much of our steel purchases were on fixed priced contracts that were put in place prior to the rise in prices 
however  we expect our quarterly steel costs will rise to pre tax by q as we enter into new contracts 
we have taken actions to partially offset the impact of these price increases  including announcing a temporary surcharge on north america customer orders placed after april  because customers may place orders earlier than they otherwise would have  the temporary surcharge could positively impact q orders and revenue with a corresponding negative impact to q orders and revenue 
we anticipate the revenue from the temporary surcharge to largely offset the steel price increase beginning in q the surcharge will continue until steel prices fall below certain thresholds 

table of contents interest expense  other income expense  net  and income taxes year ended february  february  february  interest expense  other income expense  net  and income taxes interest expense other income expense  net interest income loss on dealer transitions gain on disposal of property and equipment miscellaneous  net total other income expense  net total non operating items  net effective income tax rate the majority of the company s debt over the past several years is related to term notes with fixed interest rates 
because the balance of the term notes has been stable  and the interest rates are fixed  interest expense has been relatively stable since interest income has declined over the past three years primarily due to lower average short term interest rates 
losses on dealer transitions relate to uncollectible funds loaned to or invested in dealers to finance ownership changes 
the majority of the loss recorded in related to an international dealer transition investment originally made in we took over full ownership of this dealer during and reduced the carrying value of the investment to the net book value of the underlying tangible assets  which approximated its fair value 
during  we recognized losses on dealer transitions primarily related to two international dealers that were significantly affected by the office furniture recession in their markets 
during  we recognized losses on dealer transitions primarily related to a north america dealer whose operating results deteriorated due to a significant decline in business activity in its local market and several other performance issues 
as a result  this dealer was restructured and ownership was transitioned to new dealer principals 
losses on dealer transitions do not include write offs of receivables that have arisen as a result of product sales 
charges for write offs associated with trade receivables from these affiliates are recorded as operating expenses 
we carefully monitor the financial condition of dealers in ownership transition 
most of the dealers that have transition financing from steelcase have successfully reduced costs and taken other steps to manage through the downturn 
some individual dealers are facing difficult financial challenges 
we believe our reserves adequately reflect these credit risks 
however  if these dealers experience prolonged or deepening reduction in revenues  the likelihood of losses would increase and we would record additional charges or reserves  as necessary 

table of contents during  we recorded a gain on disposal of property and equipment primarily related to property sold in the united kingdom for net cash proceeds of about and a pre tax non operating gain of this facility was idle for about three years as a result of prior restructuring activities 
the gain in was primarily related to the sale of our tustin  california manufacturing facility following the relocation of the operations to a smaller  more efficient facility 
we received net cash proceeds of and recorded a gain of on the tustin facility sale 
our income tax benefit is a function of actual taxable loss earned by the company in different countries  the tax rates in various countries and tax planning strategies we implement 
we expect these strategies to result in a long term effective tax rate of between and

north america year ended income statement data north america february  february  february  revenue cost of sales restructuring costs gross profit operating expenses restructuring costs operating income loss revenue in declined in the north america segment following a decline from to it is important to note contained an extra week 
the decline in north america revenue was deeper than our other segments  and reflects differences in the customer base and product mix for this business 
north america traditionally serves larger customers who  we believe  have continued to tightly control their spending on facilities and to delay hiring during the early phases of the economic recovery 
the north america product mix has a high proportion of systems furniture  which has declined as a category across the industry during the downturn 
we believe these two trends are related since large customers represent a major portion of the installed base of systems furniture and are therefore an important driver of demand for those products 
we expect to see these trends reverse if the economic recovery continues and larger companies begin expanding their workforce 
cost of sales continued to be negatively impacted by higher discounts due to intense competition  underabsorption of overhead due to lower volume  disruption caused by consolidation activity and excess plant 
table of contents capacity 
in fact  discounts increased about one percent point  decreasing revenue and thus gross margins by nearly compared to steel commodity prices began to increase late in  but we do not believe this had a material impact on cost of sales in as volume declined during the year  north america took additional steps to reduce the fixed component of cost of sales 
north america reduced the hourly and salaried manufacturing workforces  rationalized and consolidated facilities and continued to implement lean manufacturing 
however  the benefits from these actions did not fully offset the underabsorption of fixed manufacturing overhead 
restructuring costs included within cost of sales included of severance costs for workforce reductions and for asset impairments 
also included within cost of sales during were curtailment gains of for post retirement medical and pension benefits 
restructuring items included within and cost of sales primarily consisted of severance costs for workforce reductions and asset impairment charges 
also included within cost of sales were curtailment gains of for post retirement medical and pension benefits 
in  we expect gross margins as a percent of revenue to continue to be pressured by high discounts  excess capacity and rising steel prices  as discussed above under the overview section 
restructuring activities are expected to continue  but at a lesser pace and cost than in for example  we expect to consolidate our wood manufacturing from three plants to one 
however  as the pace of restructuring activity declines  we expect plant operations will stabilize and productivity improvements will be more evident 
therefore  we expect to see reduced cost of sales as a percent of revenue in operating expenses decreased since this decrease is a result of salaried workforce reductions  restructuring activities and reductions in discretionary and external spending  including elimination of bonuses and reduction of retirement contributions 
restructuring charges included within  and operating expenses represented severance costs for workforce reductions 
also included within and operating expenses were curtailment gains of and  respectively  for post retirement medical and pension benefits 
we maintain loss reserves related to dealer trade receivables  and we closely monitor the financial condition of our dealers 
generally  steelcase dealers in north america have successfully reduced costs and taken other steps to manage through the industry downturn 
we have processes that allow us to monitor and react quickly to changes in the credit quality of our dealers 
we believe our reserves adequately reflect the credit risks associated with the dealer trade receivables 
however  if our dealers experience a prolonged or deeper reduction in revenues  the likelihood of losses would increase and additional charges or reserves would be necessary 

table of contents steelcase design partnership year ended february  february  february  income statement data steelcase design partnership revenue cost of sales restructuring costs gross profit operating expenses restructuring costs operating income revenue for the sdp segment declined in following an decline in it is important to note contained an extra week 
for the two year period the decline for sdp was approximately and was less than our consolidated decline of nearly 
sdp revenue is generally less dependent on large project orders and is less affected by declines in business capital spending due to its differentiated  design oriented product portfolio and focus on niche applications 
sdp margins are higher than our other segments margins 
gross margins as a percent of revenue decreased over the past two years due to higher reserves for slow moving inventory in the fabric and wall covering business  restructuring costs for workforce reductions and underabsorption of fixed overhead costs 
by reducing operating expense spending over the past two years  we held operating expenses as a percent of revenue relatively constant 
restructuring costs recorded within operating expenses in included for lease impairments and of severance charges for workforce reductions 
restructuring charges in and related to workforce reductions 

table of contents international year ended february  february  february  income statement data international revenue cost of sales restructuring costs gross profit operating expenses restructuring costs operating loss international revenue increased in due to the benefit of from favorable currency translation effects 
it is important to note contained an extra week 
this increase follows a decrease of from to international revenue is closely linked to economic conditions in key european countries 
certain of these countries are seeing ongoing weakness and others are experiencing instability related to geopolitical factors 
we believe a recovery in these international markets may lag the united states recovery 
cost of sales of was relatively flat compared to in the prior year 
international shipped some large  unusual and low margin projects during the year which masked modest improvements in underlying cost of sales performance driven by previous restructuring efforts 
gross margins as a percent of revenue declined in primarily due to higher restructuring costs 
these restructuring costs consisted primarily of costs associated with the closure or consolidation of manufacturing facilities  including workforce reductions of employees or approximately 
international gross margins remained relatively flat in compared to due to the implementation of social plans and workforce reduction efforts launched in  which resulted in a workforce reduction of in  the completion of the divestiture of two under performing businesses in q  both of which generated negative margins in and the implementation of additional cost reduction efforts aimed at lean manufacturing initiatives 
restructuring costs in and primarily related to charges for workforce reductions and business exit costs 
other selected charges included in cost of sales were costs of related to asset impairments 
we expect to continue consolidation activity in including actions that have already been announced related to our french operations 
we expect these actions will continue to improve our competitiveness 
operating expenses in absolute terms increased in  because of of currency translation effects 
operating expenses as a percent of revenue declined compared to primarily due to the realization of cost reductions related to previous restructuring efforts 
compared to  operating expenses in decreased both in absolute terms and as a percent of revenue 
the decrease can be attributed to a reduction in 
table of contents charges related to dealer credit issues  a reduction in amortization expense due to the change in accounting for goodwill  and cost reductions related to restructuring activities completed during and  including workforce reductions 
restructuring costs included in operating expenses in  and primarily consisted of charges related to workforce reductions and business exit costs 
economic conditions in certain countries continue to put pressure on some of our dealers 
we continue to monitor the financial condition of dealers for changes in credit quality 
we believe our reserves adequately reflect these credit risks 
however  if dealers experience a deeper reduction in revenues  the likelihood of losses would increase and additional charges or reserves would be necessary 
other year ended february  february  february  income statement data other revenue restructuring costs operating loss as mentioned in part i  item  our other category includes our financial services  polyvision and ideo subsidiaries  ventures and unallocated corporate expenses 
the increase in revenue from to was largely due to the acquisition of polyvision in late the reduction in operating loss from to was due to several factors including the divestiture of an unprofitable business venture in  improvements in the operating results of financial services primarily due to lower credit charges in  and improvements in the operating results of ideo  partially offset by a decline in profitability at polyvision 
approximately of corporate expenses representing shared services are charged to the operating segments as part of a corporate allocation 
the unallocated portion of these expenses is considered general corporate costs and is reported within the other category 
revenue and costs of exploring new business opportunities within new market niches or areas related to  but not part of  our core business activities are considered ventures  and are reported in the other category

our financial services subsidiary provides lease financing to end customers and various forms of financing primarily to north america dealers 
our underlying net investment in leases represents multiple sales to individual end customers and there are some concentrations of credit risk with certain customers 
we have processes that allow us to monitor and react quickly to changes in the credit quality of our lease customers 
while the overall credit quality of our portfolio remained stable in  our risk of exposure decreased as leased assets were sold and customers became more financially stable 
we closely monitor our receivable exposure and the overall financial condition of the dealers in north america to whom we extend financing 
although we believe reserves are adequate in total  deterioration in the financial stability of larger customers and dealers would likely require us to record additional charges and reserves 
during q  we outsourced lease fundings to a third party  therefore we no longer carry credit or residual risk for new leases 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity the following table summarizes our statement of cash flows year ended february  february  february  net cash flow provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents  beginning of period cash and cash equivalents  end of period we increased cash and cash equivalents by during to a balance of as of february   our highest level of cash since of our total cash  was located in the united states and the remaining was located outside of the united states  primarily europe and canada 
these funds  in addition to cash generated from future operations and available credit facilities  are expected to be sufficient to finance our known or foreseeable liquidity and capital needs 
the increase in cash and cash equivalents was due to a number of factors 
operating activities generated cash as depreciation and amortization is added back to the net loss 
depreciation and amortization continue to be much higher than current levels of capital 
table of contents expenditures 
investing activities generated cash primarily through the sales of leased assets  fixed assets and discontinued operations 
financing activities used cash to pay down debt and to pay dividends 
we look at various scenarios for cash planning purposes 
in one possible scenario a substantial and rapid increase in revenue in a short period of time we anticipate we would likely experience a corresponding rapid increase in accounts receivables and inventories 
this rapid increase in required working capital would represent a significant use of cash and is the primary reason we are holding a relatively large cash balance 
cash provided by operating activities year ended february  february  february  cash flow data operating activities net income loss depreciation and amortization cumulative effect of accounting change gain on sale of net assets of discontinued operations deferred income taxes changes in operating assets and liabilities other  net net cash provided by operating activities cash flow provided by operating activities was sufficient to fund our capital expenditure needs for and we expect this trend to continue 
most of the year to year change in cash generated from operating activities is reflected in changes in operating assets and liabilities  specifically working capital  primarily caused by the decline in revenue 
see further discussion regarding the cash impact of discontinued operations in the cash provided by used in investing activities section below 
during  accounts receivable decreased  inventories decreased and accounts payable decreased the decrease in accounts receivable is primarily a reflection of decreased revenue during the year 
inventory decreased due to lower manufacturing volume  plant consolidations and our continuing implementation of lean manufacturing principles throughout the organization 
accounts payable decreased primarily due to timing and amount of year end accruals offset by some changes in supplier terms 
in  we saw a relatively small decline in receivables and inventories  net of payables  before translation adjustments 
however  there was a substantial net decrease in other operating assets  net of other operating liabilities 
this decrease was primarily caused by a curtailment of the post retirement medical and pension benefit plans and reductions in other employee benefit liabilities related to reduction in force 
we also used cash during for restructuring costs that had been accrued during 
table of contents in  operating assets less operating liabilities decreased by the dramatic reduction in revenue from q to q drove a similar decline in receivables  inventories and payables  which is reflected in this line

the proceeds from the disposal of fixed assets in were primarily from the sale of property located in the united kingdom as discussed in the interest expense  other income expense  net  and income taxes section 
as mentioned in the general section of part i  item  during q  we sold substantially all of the net assets of our marine hardware and accessories business for cash proceeds of  resulting in a pre tax net gain of or after tax 
see further discussion and detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
while we expect to receive some cash from the sales of leased assets and fixed assets in the future  we do not expect the primary sources of cash provided by investing activities to continue to be from the sales of leased assets  fixed assets and discontinued operations 
the significant reductions in capital spending over the past two years reflect an emphasis on limiting new projects to those that meet key economic metrics and deliver short payback cost savings or support critical strategic initiatives such as product development 
at the end of  our committed capital expenditures totaled and related to numerous equipment  facility and software projects 
we expect cash flows from operating activities will provide the funds to fulfill these commitments 

table of contents the primary use of cash in investing activities during was for strategic acquisitions and capital expenditures 
acquisitions included polyvision corporation  custom cable inc and steelcase artwright manufacturing 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
in addition  we experienced a substantial decrease in dealer notes receivable during dealers required less working capital because of the downturn in the office furniture industry

approximately million shares remain available for repurchase under the program and we have no outstanding share repurchase commitments 
since the inception of our repurchase program  million shares have been repurchased for million 
the reduction in share repurchase activity since was due in part to a shift towards retaining excess cash and reducing debt

critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition is based upon our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
the company s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these principles require the use of estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and related notes 
although these estimates are based on historical data and management s 
table of contents knowledge of current events and actions it may undertake in the future  actual results may differ from the estimates if different conditions occur 
the accounting policies that typically involve a higher degree of judgment  estimates and complexity are listed and explained below 
these policies were discussed with the audit committee and affect all segments of the company 
impairment of goodwill  other intangible assets and long lived assets goodwill represents the difference between the purchase price and the related underlying tangible and identifiable intangible net asset values resulting from business acquisitions 
annually  or if conditions indicate an earlier review is necessary  the carrying value of the reporting unit is compared to an estimate of its fair value 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value  goodwill is impaired  and will be written down to its estimated fair value 
goodwill is assigned to and the fair value is tested at the reporting unit level 
we evaluate goodwill using five reporting units north america  sdp  international  polyvision and ideo 
as of february   we had of goodwill recorded on our balance sheet 
of this amount  was recorded in north america  in sdp  in international  in polyvision and in ideo 
during q  we performed our annual impairment assessment of goodwill in our reporting units consistent with the prior year 
in testing for potential impairment  we measured the estimated fair value of our reporting units using a combination of two methods based upon a discounted cash flow valuation dcf and a market value approach mva 
the first method used a weighting factor based on dcf while the second valuation was based upon of dcf and of mva 
in either case  we concluded no impairment existed in any reporting unit 
the dcf analysis was based on the present value of projected cash flows and a residual value and used the following assumptions a business is worth today what it can generate in future cash to its owners  cash received today is worth more than an equal amount of cash received in the future  and future cash flows can be reasonably estimated 
the mva used a set of four comparable companies to derive a range of market multiples for the last twelve months revenue and earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 

table of contents as of the valuation date  the enterprise value available for goodwill determined by each method described above is in excess of the book value by reporting unit as follows discounted market cash flow value reporting unit valuation approach north america steelcase design partnership international polyvision n a ideo n a the mva was not calculated for polyvision or ideo as there is no comparable market data available to make these calculations meaningful 
for each reporting unit  this excess is primarily driven by the residual value of future years 
thus  increasing the discount rate from to  leaving all other assumptions unchanged  would reduce the excess amounts above to the following amounts discounted market cash flow value reporting unit valuation approach north america steelcase design partnership international polyvision n a ideo n a we also perform impairment analyses on our other intangible assets not subject to amortization in a manner consistent with our goodwill impairment analysis 
these intangible assets primarily consist of trademarks within the polyvision reporting unit 
as of the valuation date  the fair market value approximated the book value 
a decrease in projected revenue would have resulted in an impairment in these intangible assets of approximately in addition  a increase in the discount rate would also result in an impairment in these intangible assets of approximately for our intangible assets subject to amortization and our other long lived assets including property  plant and equipment  an impairment analysis is performed at least annually 
in accordance with sfas no 
 an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of a long lived asset is not recoverable and its carrying amount exceeds its fair value 
in testing for impairment  we first determined if the asset was recoverable 
we then compared the undiscounted cash flows over the asset s remaining life to the carrying value 
see note  note and note to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding goodwill  other intangible assets and property  plant and equipment 

table of contents pension and other post retirement benefits the determination of the obligation and expense for pension and other post retirement benefits is dependent on the selection of certain actuarial assumptions used in calculating such amounts 
these assumptions include  among others  the discount rate  expected long term rate of return on plan assets and rates of increase in compensation and health care costs 
these assumptions are reviewed and updated annually based on relevant external and internal factors and information  including but not limited to  long term expected fund returns  expenses paid from the fund  rates of termination  medical inflation  technology and quality care changes  regulatory requirements  plan changes and governmental coverage changes 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding employee benefit plan obligations including a sensitivity analysis 
allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses is maintained at a level considered by management to be adequate to absorb an estimate of probable future losses existing at the balance sheet date 
in estimating probable losses  we review accounts that are past due  non performing  or in bankruptcy 
we also review accounts that may have higher credit risk using information available about the customer or dealer  such as financial statements  news reports  and published credit ratings 
we also use general information regarding industry trends  the general economic environment and information gathered through our network of field based employees 
using an estimate of current fair market value of the collateral and other credit enhancements  such as third party guarantees  we arrive at an estimated loss for specific accounts and estimate an additional amount for the remainder of the trade balance based on historical trends 
our projection of credit losses is based on estimates  and as a result we cannot predict with certainty the amount of such losses 
changes in economic conditions  the risk characteristics and composition of the portfolio  bankruptcy laws or regulatory policies and other factors could impact our actual and projected credit losses and the related allowance for possible credit losses 
if we had made different assumptions about probable credit losses  our financial position and results of operations could have differed 
uncollectible receivable balances are written off when we determine that the balance is uncollectible 
subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the allowance when received 
see further discussion regarding concentrations of credit risk in note of the consolidated financial statements 
income taxes deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
these assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse 
the company has after tax operating loss carryforwards of and after tax tax credit carryforwards of available in certain jurisdictions to reduce future taxable income 
future tax benefits for these carryforwards are recognized to the extent that realization of these benefits is considered more likely than not 
it is considered more likely than not that a benefit of will be realized on these carryforwards 
this 
table of contents determination is based on the expectation that related operations will be sufficiently profitable or various tax  business and other planning strategies will enable us to utilize the carryforwards 
to the extent that available evidence raises doubt about the realization of a deferred income tax asset  a valuation allowance is established 
we cannot be assured that we will be able to realize these future tax benefits or that future valuation allowances will not be required 
as of february   we recorded valuation allowances of and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards  respectively 
a decrease in the expected amount of benefit to be realized on the carryforwards would result in a decrease in net income of approximately forward looking statements from time to time  in written reports and oral statements  the company discusses its expectations regarding future events

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the principal market risks ie  the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices to which we are exposed include foreign exchange risk  interest rate risk and equity price risk 
foreign exchange risk operating in international markets involves exposure to the possibility of volatile movements in foreign exchange rates 
these exposures may impact future earnings and or cash flows 
revenue from foreign locations primarily europe and canada represented approximately and of our consolidated revenue in and  respectively 
we actively manage the foreign currency exposures that are associated with committed foreign currency purchases and sales created in the normal course of business at the local entity level 
exposures that cannot be naturally offset within a local entity to an immaterial amount are hedged with foreign currency derivatives 
we also have a significant amount of foreign currency net asset exposures 
we do not hold any derivatives contracts that hedge our foreign currency net asset exposures because we believe there is no long term economic benefit in doing so 
changes in foreign exchange rates that had the largest impact on translating our international operating profit for related to the euro and the canadian dollar versus the us dollar 
we estimate that a devaluation of the us dollar against the local currencies would have increased our operating loss by approximately in both and  assuming no changes other than the exchange rate itself 
however  this quantitative measure has inherent limitations 
the sensitivity analysis disregards the possibility that rates can move in opposite directions and that gains from one currency may or may not be offset by losses from another currency 
the translation of the assets and liabilities of our international subsidiaries is made using the foreign exchange rates as of the end of the year 
translation adjustments are not included in determining net income but are disclosed and accumulated in other comprehensive income within shareholders equity until sale or substantially complete liquidation of the net investment in the international subsidiary takes place 
in certain markets  the company could recognize a significant gain or loss related to unrealized cumulative translation 
table of contents adjustments if we were to exit the market and liquidate our net investment 
as of february   the net foreign currency translation adjustments reduced shareholders equity by foreign exchange gains and losses reflect transaction gains and losses 
transaction gains and losses arise from monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than a business unit s functional currency 
for  transaction losses amounted to interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk primarily on our notes receivable  investments in company owned life insurance  short term borrowings and long term debt 
substantially all of our interest rates on our term borrowings were fixed during  thus our interest rate risk was minimized 
a portion of our company owned life insurance is invested in fixed income securities 
the valuation of these securities is sensitive to changes in market interest rates 
we estimate that a change in interest rates would not have had a material impact on our results of operations for or see notes and of the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of interest rate swaps and derivative instruments 
see note in the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our investments in company owned life insurance 
equity price risk we are exposed to equity price risk from the markets in the united states primarily on our investments in company owned life insurance 
we estimate that a adverse change in the broader united states equity markets would have increased our operating loss by approximately in both and this quantitative measure has inherent limitations since not all of our equity investments are in similar asset classes 
in addition  the investment managers actively manage certain equity investments and their results could be better or worse than the broader united states equity markets returns 
see note in the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our investments in company owned life insurance
