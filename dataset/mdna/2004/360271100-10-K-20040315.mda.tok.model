results of operations overview as a financial institution with a focus on traditional banking activities  fulton financial corporation generates the majority of its revenue through net interest income  or the difference between interest income earned on loans and investments and interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
growth in net interest income is dependent upon balance sheet growth and maintaining or increasing the net interest margin  which is net interest income as a percentage of average interest earning assets 
the corporation also generates revenue through fees earned on the various services and products offered to its customers and through sales of assets  such as loans or investments 
offsetting these revenue sources are provisions for credit losses on loans  administrative expenses and income taxes 
the corporation s net income for increased million  or  from million in to million in diluted net income per share increased  or  from per share in to per share in in  the corporation realized a return on average assets of and a return on average equity of 
net income for was million  or per share diluted  compared to million  or per share diluted  in the increase in net income for the year was million  or  and the increase in net income per share was  or 
excluding the impact of merger related expenses in  the increase in net income was million  or 
the increase in earnings in was achieved despite the continued contraction of the net interest margin and the resulting million  or  decrease in net interest income due to the low interest rate environment 
this decline was offset by a million  or  increase in non interest revenue  excluding investment securities gains  particularly from investment management and trust services as well as mortgage sale gains  and a million  or  decrease in the provision for loan losses as asset quality continued to improve 
finally  the corporation realized million in investment securities gains  a million increase over 
table of contents the following summarizes some of the more significant factors that influenced the corporation s results 
interest rates short term interest rates remained low throughout  as the frb s monetary policies focused on lower interest rates to stimulate economic growth 
the overnight borrowing  or federal funds  rate and the prime lending rate ended the year at and  respectively  the lowest these key rates have been in decades 
the low short term interest rates had a negative impact on the corporation s net interest income and net interest margin 
as interest rates dropped in and  reducing the rates paid on deposits became exceedingly difficult 
as a result  average rates on earning assets decreased more than the average rates paid on liabilities  and the net interest margin and net interest income both decreased in compared to while not directly influenced by the monetary policies of the frb  longer term interest rates  including residential mortgage rates  also remained low during  dropping to the lowest rates in decades around mid year 
this stimulated mortgage refinance activity which  coupled with the corporation s recent investments in its mortgage banking business through the formation of fulton mortgage company  resulted in unprecedented residential mortgage volumes and gains on sales of loans in the secondary market 
as longer term rates started to increase during the third and fourth quarter of  mortgage volumes declined 
lower long term interest rates also affected the corporation s deposit mix as funds from maturing time deposits were deposited in core demand and savings accounts as customers were reluctant to lock into the relatively low rates being offered on time deposit products 
if the current interest rate environment continues  the corporation will be challenged to maintain and grow its net interest margin and to increase net interest income 
most of the corporation s balance sheet has repriced to current rates  however  and management does not expect further significant erosion of the net interest margin if rates remain low 
in such an environment  however  growth in net interest income will be more reliant on growth in balances than changes in rates 
in a rising rate environment  the corporation expects improvements in net interest income  as discussed in the market risk section of management s discussion 
increasing long term rates  however  tend to have a detrimental impact on mortgage loan origination volumes and related mortgage banking income 
earning assets the corporation s total average loan portfolio grew modestly during  as the runoff of residential mortgages from refinancings offset moderate growth in commercial loans and commercial mortgages 
this lack of net loan growth  combined with an increase in funds from deposit growth and additional borrowings  resulted in an increase in investment securities 
this change in the mix of earning assets from loans to investments also had a negative impact on interest income  as rates earned on investments are generally lower than those on loans 
with the improving economy  the slowdown in mortgage refinance activity and recent and pending acquisitions  the corporation is optimistic that loan growth will improve during  resulting in an increase in net interest income 
asset quality asset quality refers to the underlying credit characteristics of borrowers and the likelihood that defaults on contractual payments will result in charge offs of account balances 
asset quality is generally a function of economic conditions  but can be managed through conservative underwriting and sound collection policies and procedures 
throughout the recent economic recession  which ended in the third quarter of  and the subsequent recovery  the corporation was able to maintain strong asset quality  attributable to its credit culture and underwriting policies 
this continued in as asset quality measures such as non performing assets to total assets and net charge offs to average loans improved in comparison to as a result  asset quality had no negative impact on earnings beyond normal provisions for loan losses 
while overall asset quality has remained strong  a deterioration in quality of one or several significant accounts could have a detrimental impact and result in losses that may not be foreseeable based on current information 
in addition  rising interest rates could increase the total payments of borrowers and could have a negative impact on their ability to pay according to the terms of their loans 
equity markets during  equity markets in general experienced significant growth  which benefited the corporation in two ways 
first  investment management and trust services income increased as values of assets under management improved and as brokerage income grew 
second  the value of the corporation s equity investment portfolio  which consists mainly of bank stocks  increased  resulting in decisions to sell certain securities and allowing additional gains to be realized 
gains on sales of equities have been a recurring component of the corporation s earnings for many years 
the contribution of these gains to earnings in  however  exceeded previous years due to the aforementioned improving values 
if equity markets do not continue to perform  this component of earnings could contract 

table of contents acquisitions during  the corporation completed two acquisitions 
in august  premier bank premier of doylestown  pennsylvania became a wholly owned subsidiary and strengthened the corporation s presence in eastern pennsylvania markets 
in december  the corporation acquired approximately million of agricultural loans in central pennsylvania and delaware 
both acquisitions strengthen the corporation s core banking franchise 
in august  the corporation announced its intention to acquire resource bankshares corporation  located in virginia beach  virginia 
this will be the corporation s first acquisition in virginia  allowing it to enter a new geographic market 
the transaction is expected to close on or about april  acquisitions have long been a supplement to the corporation s internal growth 
these recent and pending acquisitions provide opportunity for additional growth as they will allow the corporation s existing products and services to be sold in new markets 
the corporation s acquisition strategy focuses on high growth areas with strong market demographics and targets organizations that have a comparable corporate culture  strong performance and good asset quality  among other factors 
under its supercommunity banking philosophy  acquired organizations generally retain their status as separate legal entities  unless consolidation with an existing affiliate bank is practical 
back office functions are generally consolidated to maximize efficiencies 
merger and acquisition activity in the financial services industry has become very competitive and the prices paid for certain acquisitions have increased recently 
while the corporation has been an active acquirer  management is committed to basing its pricing on rational economic models 
management will continue to focus on generating growth in the most cost effective manner 
net interest income net interest income is the most significant component of the corporation s net income  accounting for approximately of total revenues  excluding investment securities gains 
the ability to manage net interest income over a variety of interest rate and economic environments is important to the success of a financial institution 
growth in net interest income is generally dependent upon balance sheet growth and maintaining or growing the net interest margin 
the market risk section of management s discussion beginning on page provides additional information on the policies and procedures used by the corporation to manage net interest income

the corporation s net interest income has been significantly impacted by the reductions in short term interest rates enacted by the frb over the past three years  as well as by the historic low levels of those rates 
during  the frb reduced the overnight borrowing rate from at the beginning of the year to at the end of the year 
during this time  the corporation s assets repriced more quickly than its deposits primarily time deposits  resulting in a reduction in the net interest margin 
during  the overnight borrowing rate declined further to and the corporation s longer term liabilities  primarily time deposits  repriced to lower rates resulting in an increase in the net interest margin 
the positive impact of the time deposit repricing on the net interest margin peaked in mid  and was somewhat offset by the inability to continue to lower core deposit rates 
during  the overnight borrowing rate declined to at mid year and the impact of not being able to lower core deposit rates sufficiently became more pronounced  resulting in further net interest margin compression

net interest income decreased million  or  from million in to million in while average earning assets grew  from billion in to billion in  the net interest margin declined  or basis points  from in to in as a result of the interest rate environment  as discussed above 
during  yields earned on assets decreased further than rates paid on liabilities 
interest income decreased million  or  mainly as a result of the basis point decrease in the average yield on earning assets 
average yields decreased during due both to the general decrease in short term interest rates as well as the shift in earning assets  on a percentage basis  from higher yielding loans to generally lower yielding investment securities 
this decrease in interest income was partially offset by a million increase due to average earning asset growth 

table of contents average interest earning assets increased both in the loan and investment categories 
average loans increased by million  or  to billion in the following summarizes the growth in average loans by category 
increase decrease dollars in thousands commercial commercial mortgage residential mortgage home equity consumer and other total loan growth was particularly strong in the commercial and commercial mortgage categories 
even factoring out the loans acquired in the premier acquisition  these categories both grew approximately 
the significant reduction in mortgage loan balances was due to customer refinance activity that continued at a high rate through much of the year 
the corporation generally sells newly originated fixed rate mortgages in the secondary market to promote liquidity and manage interest rate risk 
home equity loans increased significantly due to promotional efforts and customers using home equity loans as a cost effective refinance alternative 
consumer loans decreased  reflecting customers repayment of these loans with tax advantaged residential mortgage or home equity loans 
in addition  many vehicle manufacturers continued to offer attractive financing rates  with which the corporation chose not to compete 
the average yield on loans during was  a basis point  or  decline from this reflects the basis point reduction in the corporation s average prime lending rate from in to in  as well as higher than normal prepayments received on fixed rate commercial and commercial mortgage loans 
average investment securities increased million  or  during the increase was attributable primarily to deposit growth exceeding loan growth 
total average deposit growth of million exceeded average loan growth by million during in addition  the corporation employed certain limited strategies to manage the corporation s gap position and to take advantage of low wholesale funding rates 
most of the growth in investment securities was in mortgage backed securities  which increased by million  or 
the average yield on investment securities declined significantly from in to in this decrease was due to both the relatively short maturity of the portfolio as well as the high prepayment levels experienced on mortgage backed securities 
during the past two years and particularly during  most mortgage backed securities were being purchased at premiums 
as longer term interest rates continued to fall through the first half of  the prepayments on these securities exceeded expected levels 
prepayments negatively impact yields through the acceleration of premium amortization expense  which is accounted for as a reduction of interest income 
premium amortization was million in compared to million in approximately million of premium amortization during was accelerated amortization 
interest expense decreased million  or  to million in from million in  mainly as a result of the basis point decrease in the cost of total interest bearing liabilities 
this decrease was partially offset by a million increase in interest expense due to average balance growth 
the cost of interest bearing deposits declined basis points  or  from in to in this reduction was due to both the impact of declining short term interest rates and the continuing shift in the composition of deposits from higher rate time deposits to lower rate demand and savings deposits 
customers continued to exhibit an unwillingness to invest in certificates of deposit at the rates available  instead keeping their funds in demand and savings products

interest income decreased million  or  mainly as a result of the basis point decrease in average yields that accounted for a million decline in interest income 
as previously discussed  average yields decreased during due to a general decrease in interest rates as a result of the actions of the frb 
the corporation s prime lending rate averaged in  dropping to an average of during the decrease in interest income as a result of rate changes was partially offset by a million increase due to average balance growth  primarily in investment securities 
average loans of billion were essentially flat for the period 
this was the result of strong commercial loan and commercial mortgage growth million  or  increase in average balances being offset by decreases in residential mortgages million  or and consumer loans million  or 
residential mortgages decreased as a result of the low interest rate environment generating strong refinance activity 
newly originated fixed rate mortgages were sold in the secondary market to promote liquidity and reduce interest rate risk 
consumer loans decreased mainly in direct and indirect automobile loans million  or due to the corporation electing not to compete with manufacturer sponsored loan rate incentives and consumers paying off such consumer debt with cash from mortgage refinances 
these decreases were offset in part by an increase in home equity loans million  or  as consumers took advantage of the lower rates available on these loans 
the average yield on loans during was  a basis point decline from the reduction in the corporation s average prime lending rate resulted in lower overall yields as compared to the corporation also experienced a shift of approximately million from fixed rate to adjustable rate commercial loan and commercial mortgage balances 
average investment securities increased million  or  during the increase was mainly the result of deposit growth exceeding net increases in loans 
total average deposits increased million  or  during the corporation used the excess funds to purchase investment securities  particularly mortgage backed securities  which grew by million  or 
the average yield on investment securities declined during  although the reduction was not as pronounced as that realized on the loan portfolio 
the average yield on investments was in and in 
table of contents interest expense decreased million  or  to million in from million in this resulted from a combination of declining interest rates and a shift in the composition of liabilities from higher rate time deposits to lower rate demand and savings deposits 
interest bearing demand and savings deposits increased million  or  and noninterest bearing deposits increased million  or  while time deposits decreased by million  or 
the branch acquisition contributed million to the increase in average deposits 
the net million  or  increase in average interest bearing liabilities actually resulted in a million decrease in interest expense due to the change in the composition of these liabilities 
the basis point decline in the average cost of interest bearing funds resulted in a million decrease in interest expense 
average short term borrowings increased million  or 
this additional source of funds was partially used to reduce the corporation s higher rate long term borrowings in the early part of average long term debt decreased million  or  from million in to million in provision and allowance for loan losses the credit risk associated with lending activities is accounted for by the corporation through its allowance and provision for loan losses 
the provision is the expense recognized in the income statement to adjust the allowance to its proper balance  as determined through the application of the corporation s allowance methodology procedures 
these procedures include the evaluation of the risk characteristics of the portfolio and documentation in accordance with the securities and exchange commission s sec staff accounting bulletin no

table of contents the following table presents the aggregate amount of non accrual and past due loans and other real estate owned december in thousands non accrual loans accruing loans past due days or more other real estate totals as of december   the gross interest income that would have been recorded during if nonaccrual loans had been current in accordance with their original terms was approximately million 
the amount of interest income on nonaccrual loans that was included in income was approximately million 
accrual of interest is generally discontinued when a loan becomes days past due as to principal and interest 
when interest accruals are discontinued  interest credited to income is reversed 
nonaccrual loans are restored to accrual status when all delinquent principal and interest becomes current or the loan is considered secured and in the process of collection 
certain loans  primarily residential mortgages  that are determined to be sufficiently collateralized may continue to accrue interest after reaching days past due 
excluded from the amounts presented at december  are million in loans where possible credit problems of borrowers have caused management to have serious doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the present loan repayment terms 
these loans are considered to be impaired under statement  but continue to pay according to their contractual terms and are therefore not included in non performing loans 
the following table summarizes the allocation of the allowance for loan losses by loan type december dollars in thousands allowance of loans in each category allowance of loans in each category allowance of loans in each category allowance of loans in each category allowance of loans in each category comm l  financial agriculture real estate mortgage consumer  leasing other unallocated totals over the past several years  the procedures used by the banking industry to evaluate the allowance for loan losses have received increased attention from the sec  regulatory bodies and the accounting industry 
these groups have attempted to reconcile the accounting theory of reserving for loan losses  which requires that the allowance represent management s estimate of the losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date  with the regulatory goals of safety and soundness 
while the resulting guidance provided by these groups has not changed the accounting  it has focused on clarifying the application of existing accounting pronouncements and improving documentation 
as with others in the industry  the corporation has used this guidance to improve its process and its documentation 
the unallocated allowance for loan losses  as shown in the preceding table  remained at of the total allowance  unchanged from the corporation continues to monitor its allowance methodology to ensure compliance with both regulatory and accounting industry policies 

table of contents the provision for loan losses decreased million  or  in and million  or  the decrease in was due to the continued improvement in the corporation s asset quality resulting in lower net charge offs and a lower required provision for the year 
net charge offs were elevated in both and related to specific credits 
in the corporation also provided an additional million related to the july acquisition of drovers bancshares corporation drovers 
non performing assets decreased million  or  as compared to  representing a basis point decrease as a percentage of total assets in and in 
net charge offs as a percentage of average loans were in  a five basis point decrease from net charge offs decreased in all loan types during the declines in both ratios reflect the improving quality of the corporation s portfolio during the year 
the provision for loan losses in resulted from the corporation s allowance allocation procedures 
trends that would indicate the need for a higher provision include the general national and regional economies and the continued growth in the corporation s commercial loan and commercial mortgage portfolios  which are inherently more risky than other loan types 
offsetting these trends were the improvements in the quality of the corporation s portfolio  as evidenced by its improving asset quality measures over the past several years 
the net result of the corporation s allowance allocation procedures was a provision for loan losses that was million less than and was comparable to total net charge offs for the year 
management believes that the allowance balance of million at december  is sufficient to cover losses inherent in the loan portfolio on that date and is appropriate based on applicable accounting standards

mortgage banking income consists of net gains on the sales of mortgage loans and servicing income  net of the amortization of mortgage servicing rights 
net gains on sales of mortgage loans increased million  or  partially offset by a decrease in net servicing income of million  or 
in  net gains on sales of mortgage loans increased million  or  and servicing income decreased  or 
the increase in gains on sales of mortgage loans in both years was due to the historically low average rates for year fixed rate mortgage loans throughout the period and to the corporation dedicating additional resources to enhance its mortgage banking activities 
the decreases in net servicing income in and resulted from increased amortization of servicing rights due to prepayments of serviced loans 
although mortgage rates were generally low throughout  an upward trend during the last six months of the year was evident 
in addition  it is generally believed that the refinancing market has reached a saturation point due to the high volume of activity during the past two years 
for these reasons  the corporation expects future mortgage origination volumes to be much lower than those realized over the past two years

on an average balance basis  cash and due from banks increased million  or  from million in to million in following an million  or  increase in excluding the impact of premier  the increases in both years resulted from growth in the corporation s branch network 
other assets  including accrued interest receivable and goodwill  increased million  or  in to million  following a million  or  decrease in the net increase in was primarily due to a million increase in goodwill and intangible assets recorded for premier and an million increase in the net deferred tax asset mainly as a result of a decrease in the unrealized gains on investment securities 
the net decrease in resulted mainly from an million decrease in the net deferred tax asset due to an increase in unrealized gains on investment securities 
the corporation continued to increase its participation in affordable housing projects through investments in partnerships 
equity investments of million were made to five new partnerships in the corporation made its initial investment of this type during and is now involved in partnerships  located in the communities served by its subsidiary banks 
the carrying value of these investments was approximately million at december  with these investments  the corporation not only improves the quantity and quality of available housing for low income individuals in support of its banks community reinvestment act compliance efforts  but also becomes eligible for tax credits under federal and  in some cases  state programs 
deposits and borrowings deposits increased million  or  to billion at december  million  or  excluding premier 
this compares to an increase of million  or  in the recent trend has been moderate internal growth in deposit funding  supplemented by acquisitions

table of contents both years the increase resulted from the actions taken to manage the gap position and to take advantage of low funding rates 
long term debt increased million  or  during  after increasing million  or  during the increase in was mainly due to the million of junior subordinated debentures assumed from premier 
the increase in resulted from the corporation taking advantage of the lower rates available and increasing its borrowings from the federal home loan bank 
shareholders equity total shareholders equity of million  or of ending total assets  increased million  or  from december  growth in shareholders equity generally results from comprehensive income during the period  offset by dividends paid to shareholders  which have historically amounted to of current period net income 
shareholders equity also increased million as a result of stock issued for the premier acquisition 
this increase was somewhat offset by the purchase of million of treasury stock 
in  shareholders equity increased million  or 
this higher growth rate in reflects fewer treasury stock purchases 
the corporation periodically implements stock repurchase plans for various corporate purposes 
in addition to evaluating the financial benefits of implementing repurchase plans  management also considers liquidity needs  the current market price per share and relevant accounting and regulatory issues 
repurchase plans were significantly limited during periods when the corporation accounted for acquisitions using pooling of interests accounting 
while statement removed these accounting restraints by requiring the use of purchase accounting  recent sec rules have placed additional restrictions on stock repurchases 
the corporation has a stock repurchase plan that was originally approved by the board of directors in december and is currently scheduled to terminate in june this plan allows for the repurchase of up to million shares of the corporation s common stock to be used for general corporate purposes 
through december  approximately  shares had been repurchased under this plan 
the corporation and its subsidiary banks are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by banking regulators 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain actions by regulators that could have a material effect on the corporation s financial statements 
the regulations require that banks maintain minimum amounts and ratios of total and tier i capital as defined in the regulations to risk weighted assets as defined  and tier i capital to average assets as defined 
as of december   the corporation and each of its bank subsidiaries met the minimum capital requirements 
in addition  the corporation and each of its bank subsidiaries capital ratios exceeded the amounts required to be considered well capitalized as defined in the regulations 

table of contents contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements the corporation has various financial obligations that may require future cash payments 
these obligations include the payment of liabilities recorded on the corporation s balance sheet as well as contractual obligations for purchased services or for operating leases 
the following table summarizes significant contractual obligations to third parties  by type  that are fixed and determinable at december  payments due in one year or less one to three years three to five years over five years total in thousands deposits with no stated maturity a time deposits b short term borrowings c long term debt c operating leases d purchase obligations e a includes demand deposits and savings accounts  which can be withdrawn by customers at any time 
b see additional information regarding time deposits in note h deposits in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
c see additional information regarding borrowings in note i short term borrowings and long term debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
d see additional information regarding operating leases in note n leases in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
e includes significant information technology  telecommunication and data processing outsourcing contracts 
variable obligations  such as those based on transaction volumes  are not included 
in addition to the contractual obligations listed in the preceding table  the corporation is a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit  which involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk that are not recognized in the consolidated balance sheets 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued to guarantee the financial or performance obligation of a customer to a third party 
commitments and standby letters of credit do not necessarily represent future cash needs as they may expire without being drawn 
the following table summarizes the corporation s commitments to extend credit and letters of credit as of december  in thousands commercial mortgage  construction and land development home equity credit card commercial and other total commitments to extend credit standby letters of credit commercial letters of credit total letters of credit 
table of contents critical accounting policies the following is a summary of those accounting policies that the corporation considers to be most important to the portrayal of its financial condition and results of operations as they require management s most difficult judgments as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
allowance and provision for loan losses the corporation accounts for the credit risk associated with its lending activities through the allowance and provision for loan losses 
the allowance is an estimate of the losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date 
the provision is the periodic charge to earnings which is necessary to adjust the allowance to its proper balance 
on a quarterly basis  the corporation assesses the adequacy of its allowance through a methodology that consists of the following identifying loans for individual review under fasb statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan statement 
in general  these consist of large balance commercial loans and commercial mortgages 
assessing whether the loans identified for review under statement are impaired 
that is  whether it is probable that all amounts will not be collected according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
for loans identified as impaired  calculating the estimated fair value  using observable market prices  discounted cash flows or the value of the underlying collateral 
classifying all non impaired large balance loans based on credit risk ratings and allocating an allowance for loan losses based on appropriate factors  including recent loss history for similar loans 
identifying all smaller balance homogeneous loans for evaluation collectively under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies statement 
in general  these loans include residential mortgages  consumer loans  installment loans  smaller balance commercial loans and mortgages and lease receivables 
statement loans are segmented into groups with similar characteristics and an allowance for loan losses is allocated to each segment based on recent loss history and other relevant information 
reviewing the results to determine the appropriate balance of the allowance for loan losses 
this review gives additional consideration to factors such as the mix of loans in the portfolio  the balance of the allowance relative to total loans and non performing assets  trends in the overall risk profile of the portfolio  trends in delinquencies and non accrual loans and local and national economic conditions 
an unallocated allowance is maintained to recognize the imprecision in estimating and measuring loss exposure 
documenting the results of its review in accordance with sab the allowance review methodology is based on information known at the time of the review 
changes in factors underlying the assessment could have a material impact on the amount of the allowance that is necessary and the amount of provision to be charged against earnings 
such changes could impact future results 
goodwill with the adoption of statements and  effective on january   the corporation discontinued the amortization of goodwill associated with qualifying acquisitions 
as of january   and at least annually thereafter  recorded goodwill is subject to impairment testing to determine whether write downs of the recorded balances are necessary 
the corporation performs its annual goodwill impairment test as of october st of each year 
the corporation tests for impairment by first allocating its goodwill and other assets and liabilities  as necessary  to defined reporting units 
a fair value is then determined for each reporting unit 
if the fair values of the reporting units exceed their book values  no write down of the recorded goodwill is necessary 
if the fair values are less than the book values  an additional test is necessary to assess the proper carrying value of the goodwill 
the corporation determined that no impairment write offs were necessary during and business unit valuation is inherently subjective  with a number of factors based on assumptions and management judgments 
among these are future growth rates for the reporting units  discount rates and earnings capitalization rates 
changes in assumptions and results due to economic conditions  industry factors and reporting unit performance and cash flow projections could result in different assessments of the fair values of reporting units and could result in impairment charges in the future 

table of contents income taxes the provision for income taxes is based upon the results of operations  adjusted for the effect of certain tax exempt income and non deductible expenses 
in addition  certain items of income and expense are reported in different periods for financial reporting and tax return purposes 
the tax effects of these temporary differences are recognized currently in the deferred income tax provision or benefit 
deferred tax assets or liabilities are computed based on the difference between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using the applicable enacted marginal tax rate 
the corporation must also evaluate the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
if any such assets are not likely to be recovered  a valuation allowance must be recognized 
the corporation has determined that a valuation allowance is not required for deferred tax assets as of december  the assessment of the carrying value of deferred tax assets is based on certain assumptions  changes in which could have a material impact on the corporation s financial statements 
recent accounting pronouncements note a of the notes to consolidated financial statements discusses the expected impact of recently issued accounting standards which have not yet been adopted by the corporation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the exposure to economic loss that arises from changes in the values of certain financial instruments 
the types of market risk exposures generally faced by financial institutions include interest rate risk  equity market price risk  foreign currency risk and commodity price risk 
due to the nature of its operations  only equity market price risk and interest rate risk are significant to the corporation 
equity market price risk equity market price risk is the risk that changes in the values of equity investments could have a material impact on the financial position or results of operations of the corporation 
the corporation s equity investments consist primarily of common stocks of publicly traded financial institutions cost basis of approximately million  fair value of million at december  
the corporation s financial institutions stock had gross unrealized gains of approximately million at december although the carrying value of financial institutions stock accounted for less than of the corporation s total assets  the unrealized gains on the portfolio represent a potential source of revenue 
the corporation has a history of periodically realizing gains from this portfolio and  if values were to decline significantly  this revenue source could be lost 
management continuously monitors the fair value of its equity investments and evaluates current market conditions and operating results of the companies 
periodic sale and purchase decisions are made based on this monitoring process 
none of the corporation s equity securities are classified as trading 
future cash flows from these investments are not provided in the table on page as such investments do not have maturity dates 
through early  certain of the corporation s equity investments had shown negative returns in tandem with the general performance of equity markets 
the corporation had evaluated  based on existing accounting guidance  whether the decreases in value of any of these investments constituted other than temporary impairment which would require a write down through a charge to earnings 
in  the corporation recorded write downs of million for specific equity securities which were deemed to exhibit other than temporary impairment in value 
as of december   those individual securities had recovered approximately million of the amount written down 
additional impairment charges may be necessary depending upon the performance of the equity markets in general and the performance of the individual investments held by the corporation 
in addition to its equity portfolio  the corporation s investment management and trust services revenue could be impacted by fluctuations in the securities markets 
a portion of the corporation s trust revenue is based on the value of the underlying investment portfolios 
if securities markets contract  the corporation s revenue could be negatively impacted 
in addition  the ability of the corporation to sell its brokerage services is dependent in part  upon consumers level of confidence in the outlook for rising securities prices 
interest rate risk and asset liability management interest rate risk creates exposure in two primary areas 
first  changes in rates have an impact on the corporation s liquidity position and could affect its ability to meet obligations and continue to grow 
second  movements in interest rates can create fluctuations in the corporation s net interest income and changes in the economic value of its equity 

table of contents the corporation employs various management techniques to minimize its exposure to interest rate risk 
an asset liability management committee alco  consisting of key financial and senior management personnel  meets on a weekly basis 
the alco is responsible for reviewing the interest rate sensitivity position of the corporation  approving asset and liability management policies  and overseeing the formulation and implementation of strategies regarding balance sheet positions and earnings 
the primary goal of asset liability management is to address the liquidity and net interest income risks noted above 
from a liquidity standpoint  the corporation must maintain a sufficient level of liquid assets to meet the ongoing cash flow requirements of customers  who  as depositors  may want to withdraw funds or who  as borrowers  need credit availability 
liquidity sources are found on both sides of the balance sheet 
liquidity is provided on a continuous basis through scheduled and unscheduled principal reductions and interest payments on outstanding loans and investments 
liquidity is also provided through the availability of deposits and borrowings 
the corporation s sources and uses of cash were discussed in general terms in the net interest income section of management s discussion 
the consolidated statements of cash flows provide additional information 
the corporation generated million in cash from operating activities during  mainly due to net income 
investing activities resulted in a net cash outflow of million  compared to a net cash outflow of million in  as proceeds from sales and maturities of investment securities decreased in proportion to purchases in both periods 
finally  financing activities resulted in a net inflow of million in and million in as excess funds from net deposit growth and borrowings exceeded net common stock activity in both periods liquidity must also be managed at the fulton financial corporation parent company level 
for safety and soundness reasons  banking regulations limit the amount of cash that can be transferred from subsidiary banks to the parent company in the form of loans and dividends 
generally  these limitations are based on the subsidiary banks regulatory capital levels and their net income 
the parent company has historically been able to meet its cash needs through normal  allowable dividends and loans 
if additional cash needs arise that cannot be met through such dividends and loans  the parent company may need to pursue alternative funding sources  including stock or debt issuances 
at december   liquid assets defined as cash and due from banks  short term investments  mortgages available for sale  securities available for sale  and non mortgage backed securities held to maturity due in one year or less totaled billion  or of total assets 
this compares to billion  or of total assets  at december  
table of contents the following tables set forth the maturities of investment securities at december  and the weighted average yields of such securities calculated based on historical cost 
held to maturity at amortized cost maturing within one year after one but within five years after five but within ten years after ten years amount yield amount yield amount yield amount yield dollars in thousands us government and agency securities state and municipal other securities totals mortgage backed securities available for sale at estimated fair value maturing within one year after one but within five years after five but within ten years after ten years amount yield amount yield amount yield amount yield dollars in thousands us government and agency securities state and municipal other securities totals mortgage backed securities weighted average yields on tax exempt securities have been computed on a fully tax equivalent basis assuming a tax rate of percent 
maturities for mortgage backed securities are dependent upon the interest rate environment and prepayments on the underlying loans 
for the purpose of this table  the entire balance and weighted average rate is shown in one period 
the corporation s investment portfolio consists mainly of mortgage backed securities  which do not have stated maturities 
cash flows from such investments are dependent upon the performance of the underlying mortgage loans  and are generally influenced by the level of interest rates 
as rates increase  cash flows generally decrease as prepayments on the underlying mortgage loans slow 
as rates decrease  cash flows generally increase as prepayments increase 
the corporation invests primarily in five and seven year balloon mortgage backed securities 

table of contents the following table summarizes the approximate contractual maturity and sensitivity of certain loan types  excluding consumer loans and leases  to changes in interest rates as of december  one year or less one through five years more than five years total in thousands commercial  financial and agricultural floating rate fixed rate total real estate mortgage floating rate fixed rate total real estate construction floating rate fixed rate total from a funding standpoint  the corporation has been able to rely over the years on a stable base of core deposits 
even though the corporation has experienced notable changes in the composition and interest sensitivity of this deposit base  it has been able to rely on this base to provide needed liquidity 
the corporation also has access to sources of large denomination or jumbo time deposits and repurchase agreements as potential sources of liquidity 
however  the corporation has attempted to minimize its reliance upon these more volatile short term funding sources and to use them primarily to meet the requirements of its existing customer base or when it is profitable to do so 
maturities of time deposits of  or more outstanding at december  are summarized as follows in thousands three months or less over three through six months over six through twelve months over twelve months total each of the corporation s subsidiary banks is a member of the fhlb and has access to fhlb overnight and term credit facilities 
at december   the corporation had million in term advances from the fhlb with an additional billion of borrowing capacity including both short term funding on its lines of credit and long term borrowings 
this availability  along with federal funds lines at various correspondent commercial banks  provides the corporation with additional liquidity

amounts are based on contractual maturities of federal home loan bank advances  adjusted for possible calls 
amounts include federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase  which mature in less than days  and floating rate fhlb advances 
the preceding table and discussion addressed the liquidity implications of interest rate risk and focused on expected contractual cash flows from financial instruments 
expected maturities  however  do not necessarily estimate the net interest income impact of interest rate changes 
certain financial instruments  such as adjustable rate loans  have repricing periods that differ from expected cash flows 
the corporation uses three complementary methods to measure and manage interest rate risk 
they are static gap analysis  simulation of earnings  and estimates of economic value of equity 
using these measurements in tandem provides a reasonably comprehensive summary of the magnitude of interest rate risk in the corporation  level of risk as time evolves  and exposure to changes in interest rates 
static gap provides a measurement of repricing risk in the corporation s balance sheet as of a point in time 
this measurement is accomplished through stratification of the corporation s assets and liabilities into repricing periods 
the assets and liabilities in each of these periods are compared for mismatches within that maturity segment 
core deposits not having a contractual maturity are placed into repricing periods based upon historical balance performance 
repricing for mortgage loans and for mortgage backed securities 
table of contents includes the effect of expected cash flows 
estimated prepayment effects are applied to these balances based upon industry projections for prepayment speeds 
the corporation s policy limits the cumulative month gap to plus or minus of total earning assets 
the cumulative month gap as of december  was 
the following is a summary of the interest sensitivity gaps for various time intervals as of december  days days days gap cumulative gap simulation of net interest income is performed for the next twelve month period 
a variety of interest rate scenarios are used to measure the effects of sudden and gradual movements upward and downward in the yield curve 
these results are compared to the results obtained in a flat or unchanged interest rate scenario 
simulation of earnings is used primarily to measure the corporation s short term earnings exposure to rate movements 
the corporation s policy limits the potential exposure of net interest income to of the base case net interest income for every basis point shock in interest rates 
a shock is an immediate upward or downward movement of interest rates across the yield curve based upon changes in the prime rate 
the following table summarizes the expected impact of interest rate shocks on net interest income due to the current low rates  only the basis shock in a downward scenario is shown rate shock annual change in net interest income change bp million bp million bp million bp million economic value of equity estimates the discounted present value of asset cash flows and liability cash flows 
discount rates are based upon market prices for like assets and liabilities 
upward and downward shocks of interest rates are used to determine the comparative effect of such interest rate movements relative to the unchanged environment 
this measurement tool is used primarily to evaluate the longer term repricing risks and options in the corporation s balance sheet 
a policy limit of of economic equity may be at risk for every basis point shock movement in interest rates 
the following table summarizes the expected impact of interest rate shocks on economic value of equity due to the current low rates  only the basis shock in a downward scenario is shown rate shock change in economic value of equity change bp million bp million bp million bp million as with any modeling system  the results of the static gap and simulation of net interest income and economic value of equity are a function of the assumptions and projections built into the model 
the actual behavior of the financial instruments could differ from these assumptions and projections
