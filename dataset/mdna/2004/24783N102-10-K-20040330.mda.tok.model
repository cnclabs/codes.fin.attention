item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included in another part of this annual report 
this discussion contains certain forward looking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties 
when used in this report the words anticipate  believe  estimate  expect and similar expressions as they relate to our management or us are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
our actual results  performance or achievements could differ materially from those expressed in  or implied by  these forward looking statements 
historical operating results are not necessarily indicative of the trends in operating results for any future period 
overview we are a provider of integrated voice over internet protocol voip telephony services and we were founded in to capitalize on the growth of the internet as a communications tool by commercially offering internet protocol ip telephony services 
ip telephony is the real time transmission of voice communications in the form of digitized packets of information over the internet or a private network  similar to the way in which e mail and other data is transmitted 

our business currently includes the provision of enhanced web based and other communications services to individual consumers under our iconnecthere brand name  the provision of enhanced web based and other communications services to international resellers  under either their own brand name  a white label brand  and or our iconnecthere brand name  the provision of a total hosted communications solution that enables resellers  corporate customers and service providers to offer private label telecommunications to their customer bases  and  the transmission of voice and data traffic for communications carriers 
prior to  our focus was to build a privately managed  global network utilizing ip technology  and our business primarily consisted of carrying and transmitting traffic for communications carriers over our network 
beginning in  we began to diversify our offerings by layering enhanced ip telephony services over our network 
these enhanced services were targeted at consumers and were primarily accessible through our consumer web site 
during  we began offering services on a co branded or private label basis to service providers and other businesses to assist them in diversifying their product offerings to their customer bases 
our privately managed ip network received the best built public network award for excellence in ip services applications at supercomm we were also recognized as the best ip telephony provider by smartmoney magazine and pc world magazine during we were recognized for our innovative broadband phone offering during  receiving both the tmc labs innovation award  and the communications solutions r magazine product of the year award 
in  we continued to enhance our unique strengths through our pioneering work with the session initiation protocol sip  an internet engineering task force standard that has been embraced by industry leaders such as microsoft and the rd generation partnership project gpp  which is a global cooperation between six organizational partners who are recognized as the world s major standardization bodies from the united states  europe  china  japan and korea 
in  we also announced the launch of our state of the art sip session initiation protocol infrastructure  and we became one of the first service providers to have built an end to end sip network 
during  our continuing sip efforts resulted in our launch of our sip based dialer  and in we continued to add new devices  new features and new calling plans to our offerings 
these efforts continue to position us as one of the leading providers of voip services 
factors affecting future results industry and economic factors our operations and earnings are affected by local  regional and global events or conditions that affect supply and demand for telecommunications products and services 
these events or conditions are generally not predictable and include  among other things  general economic growth rates and the occurrence of economic recessions  the development of new supply sources  supply disruptions  technological advances  including advances in telecommunications technology and advances in technology relating to telecommunications usage  changes in demographics  including population growth rates and consumer preferences  and the competitiveness of alternative telecommunications sources or product substitutes 
currently  the economy in general and the telecommunications industry in particular are suffering 
a number of the leading telecommunications companies have seen their market capitalizations decrease dramatically and some have filed for bankruptcy protection 
as a result  raising capital has become extremely difficult  there is extreme pressure on the pricing of telecommunications services and potential customers and partners have sharply cut back on expenditures  all of which impact us 
competitive factors the telecommunications industry is highly competitive 
there is competition within the traditional telecommunications marketplaces landline and wireless and also with other emergent next generation telecommunications providers  including ip telecommunications providers in supplying the overall telecommunications needs of businesses and individual consumers 
we compete with other telecommunications firms in the sale and purchase of various products and services in many national and international markets and employ all methods of competition which are lawful and appropriate for such purposes 
a key component of our competitive position  particularly given the commodity based nature of many of our products  is our ability to manage operating expenses successfully  which requires continuous management focus on reducing unit costs and improving efficiency 
political factors our operations and earnings have been  and may in the future be  affected from time to time in varying degree by political instability and by other political developments and laws and regulations  such as forced divestiture of assets  restrictions on production  imports and exports  war or other international conflicts  civil unrest and local security concerns that threaten the safe operation of company facilities  price controls  tax increases and retroactive tax claims  expropriation of property  cancellation of contract rights  and telecommunications regulations 
both the likelihood of such occurrences and their overall effect upon us vary greatly from country to country and are not predictable 
project factors in addition to the factors cited above  the advancement  cost and results of particular projects depend on the outcome of negotiations with potential partners  governments  suppliers  customers or others  changes in operating conditions or costs  and the occurrence of unforeseen technical difficulties 
risk factors see risk factors below for discussion of the impact of market risks  financial risks and other uncertainties 
revenues prior to june   our majority shareholder was rsl com  a large telecommunications provider  who was also our largest customer 
as such  for financial reporting purposes for fiscal year and prior years  revenues were derived from affiliates and non affiliates 
revenues from affiliates consist of revenues received from rsl com for the carrier transmission and calling card services we provided to rsl com  prior to atarey s acquisition of rsl com s holdings of our stock 
the majority of the services we provided to rsl com were resold by rsl com to other communications companies  and the remainder were used directly by rsl com s customers 
carrier transmission services to rsl com accounted for of our total revenues in both and revenues from non affiliates consist of revenues from end users of our enhanced ip communications services  including pc to phone  broadband phone and phone to phone  which are generated by our both our consumer offering  iconnecthere  and our hosted communications solution  and revenues from carriers other than rsl com for carrier transmission services 
all revenues are recognized as the services are performed 
the provision of enhanced ip communications services primarily pc to phone through iconnecthere accounted for and of our total revenues in and  respectively  while the provision of enhanced ip communications services through our reseller and service provider sales efforts including sales of our hosted communications solution accounted for and of our total revenues in and  respectively 
carrier transmission services to non affiliates accounted for and of our total revenues in and  respectively 
costs and operating expenses costs and operating expenses consist of cost of revenues  research and development expenses  selling and marketing expenses  general and administrative expense  depreciation and amortization of goodwill  non cash stock compensation  write down of fixed assets  expenses due to cancellation of agreement with a supplier and impairment of goodwill related expenses 
o cost of revenues consist primarily of access  termination and transmission costs paid to carriers that we incur when providing services and fixed costs associated with leased transmission lines 
the term of our contracts for leased transmission lines is generally one year  or less  and either party can terminate with prior notice 
o research and development expenses consist primarily of costs associated with establishing our network and the initial testing of our services and compensation expenses of software developers involved in new product development and software maintenance 
in the future  these expenses may fluctuate as a percentage of revenue depending on the project undertaken during the reporting period 
since our inception  we have expensed all research and development costs in each of the periods in which they were incurred 
o selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of advertising and promotional expenses incurred to attract potential consumer users of iconnecthere and expenses associated with our direct sales force incurred to attract potential reseller  corporate  and service provider customers including sales of our hosted communications solution 
we anticipate that as we add new paid users we will be able to spread these costs over a larger revenue base and accordingly improve our operating margins 
o general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and benefits for management  finance and administrative personnel  occupancy costs and legal and accounting fees  as well as the expenses associated with being a public company  including the costs of directors and officers insurance 
we have not recorded any income tax benefit for net losses and credits incurred for any period from inception to december  the utilization of these losses and credits depends on our ability to generate taxable income in the future 
because of the uncertainty of our generating taxable income  we have recorded a full valuation allowance with respect to these deferred assets 
we recognized  in non cash compensation expense in   in  and in critical accounting policies the securities and exchange commission defines critical accounting policies as those that are  in management s view  most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results of operations and most demanding on their calls on judgment  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
we believe our most critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition and deferred revenue we record revenue from internet telephony services based on minutes or fractions thereof of customer usage 
we record payments received in advance for prepaid services and services to be supplied under contractual agreements as deferred revenue until such related services are provided 
we estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts by reviewing the status of significant past due receivables and analyzing historical bad debt trends and we then reduce accounts receivables by such allowance for doubtful accounts to expected net realizable value 
long lived assets property and equipment are stated at cost 
depreciation is calculated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the depreciable assets  which range from two to five years 
improvements are capitalized  while repair and maintenance costs are charged to operations as incurred 
our long lived assets are reviewed for impairment on a quarterly basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances occur indicating that the net carrying amount may not be recoverable 
we review for impairment by comparing the carrying value of the long lived asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the long lived assets and their eventual disposition 
if the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of assets  we would recognize an impairment loss 
the impairment loss  if determined to be necessary  would be measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the long lived asset exceeds the fair value of the long lived asset based on estimated future discounted cash flows

non affiliates 
revenues from non affiliates increased approximately million or to approximately million in from approximately million in revenues from enhanced ip communications services including our hosted communications solution increased by approximately million or to approximately million in from approximately million in  due to a greater number of iconnecthere  reseller  corporate and service provider customers  yielding a greater number of calls being placed by an increasing user base 
revenues from carrier transmission services for telecommunications carriers decreased by approximately million or to approximately million in from approximately million in  due primarily to decreased demand from a smaller customer base 
one master reseller accounted for approximately of our sales in aggregate in costs and operating expenses cost of revenues 
cost of revenues decreased by million or to million in from million in  due to both a decrease in the amount of carrier traffic being terminated and lower pricing from suppliers

liquidity and capital resources since our inception in june  we have incurred significant operating and net losses due in large part to the start up and development of our operations 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we anticipate that we will continue to incur operating and net losses for the foreseeable future 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million  marketable securities and other short term investments of approximately million and working capital of approximately million 
we generated negative cash flow from operating activities of approximately million during compared with negative cash flow from operating activities of million during accounts receivable were approximately million and million at december  and december   respectively 
net cash used in investing activities decreased from  during to  in our capital expenditures decreased from approximately  in the year ended december  compared to approximately  in the year ended december   as we better utilized our existing domestic and international network infrastructure 
short term  we obtain our funding from our utilization of the remaining proceeds from our initial public offering offset by positive or negative cash flow from our operations 
these proceeds are maintained as cash and cash equivalents with an original maturity of three months or less 
based on current trends in our operations  these funds will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements  including operating losses  and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next fiscal year  assuming that our business plan is implemented successfully  and that o our recent revenue trends  which reflected an increase in our higher margin primarily pc to phone products and services continues to increase  o our expense trends remain at or near the rates of our fourth quarter rates  which were significantly reduced compared to the previous the year through reductions in personnel  curtailment of discretionary expenditures  and reduced network rent and termination rates from our carriers  and o our net cash burn rate  which was significantly reduced compared to the previous year due to the foregoing factors to approximately million in the fourth quarter of  continues to improve throughout and beyond 
to the extent that these trends do not remain steady  or if in the longer term we are not able to successfully implement our business strategy we may be required to raise additional funds for our ongoing operations 
additional financing may not be available when needed or  if available  such financing may not be on terms favorable to us  especially in light of current economic conditions and the unfavorable market for telecommunications companies in particular 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities  our existing stockholders may experience significant dilution 
in addition  while the indentures governing outstanding indebtedness of rsl com were cancelled and no longer restrict our ability to incur indebtedness  we cannot assure you that any third party will be willing or able to provide additional capital on favorable terms or at all 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table sets forth our future contractual obligations and commercial commitments in total  for each of the next five years and thereafter 
contractual obligations payments due by period in thousands less than more than total year years years years real estate leases     auto leases other operating leases capital lease obligations purchase obligations other commercial commitments other long term liabilities reflected on the registrant s balance sheet under gaap total      risk factors in addition to the other information included in this annual report  you should consider the following risk factors 
this annual report contains forward looking statements covered by the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may affect our business and prospects 
our results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward looking statements as a result of certain factors that are listed below or discussed elsewhere in this annual report and our other filings with the securities and exchange commission 
risks related to our company we have a history of losses and negative cash flow and we anticipate they will continue we have incurred significant losses since inception  and we expect to continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future 
we reported net losses of approximately million in  approximately million in  and approximately million in as of december   our accumulated deficit was approximately million 
we generated negative cash flow of approximately million during and million during as a percentage of revenues  our net loss was in  in and in our revenues may not grow or even continue at their current level 
as a result  while we believe we have sufficient funds to meet our working capital requirements for at least the next fiscal year see liquidity and capital resources  we will need to increase our revenues significantly to become profitable 
in order to increase our revenues  we need to attract and maintain customers to increase the fees we collect for our services 
if our revenues do not increase as much as we expect or if our expenses increase at a greater pace than revenues  we may never be profitable or  if we become profitable  we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
we will need additional capital to finance our operations in the future we intend to continue to enhance and expand our network in order to maintain our competitive position and meet the increasing demands for service quality  capacity and competitive pricing 
also  the introduction of new products and or service will require significant marketing and promotional expenses that we often incur before we begin to receive the related revenue 
while we believe we have sufficient funds to meet our working capital requirements for at least the next fiscal year see liquidity and capital resources  if our cash flow from operations is not sufficient to meet our capital expenditure and working capital requirements  we will need to raise additional capital to continue our operations 
especially in light of current economic conditions and the unfavorable market for telecommunications companies in particular  we may not be able to raise additional capital  and if we are able to raise additional capital through the issuance of additional equity  our current investors could experience dilution 
if we are unable to obtain additional capital  we may be required to reduce the scope of our business or our anticipated growth  which would reduce our revenues 
we have a limited operating history upon which you can evaluate us we have only a limited operating history upon which you can evaluate our business and prospects 
we commenced operations in june you should consider our prospects in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties we may encounter as an early stage company in the new and rapidly evolving market for ip communications services 
these risks include our ability o to increase acceptance of our enhanced ip communications services including our hosted communications solution  thereby increasing the number of users of our ip telephony services  o to compete effectively  o to develop new products and keep pace with developing technology 
in addition  because we expect an increasing percentage of our revenues to be derived from our enhanced ip communications services including our hosted communications solution  our past operating results may not be indicative of our future results 
we may not be able to expand our revenue and achieve profitability our business strategy is to expand our revenue sources to include the provision of enhanced ip communications services to several different customer groups 
we can neither assure you that we will be able to accomplish this nor that this strategy will be profitable 
currently  our revenues are primarily generated by sales of enhanced ip communications services through our direct consumer offering  iconnecthere  and our service provider and reseller sales channel including sales of our hosted communications solution 
enhanced ip communications services from these channels generated   and of our total revenues in  and  respectively 
the provision of enhanced ip communications services has not been profitable to date and may not be profitable in the future 
in the future  we intend to generate increased revenues from enhanced ip communications services  from multiple sources  many of which are unproven  including the commercial sale of our hosted communications solution 
we expect that our revenues for the foreseeable future will be dependent on  among other factors o sales of enhanced ip communications services  including sales of our hosted communications solution  o acceptance and use of ip telephony  o expansion of service offerings  o traffic levels on our network  o the effect of competition  regulatory environment  international long distance rates and access and transmission costs on our prices  o continued improvement of our global network quality 
we may not be able to sustain our current revenues or successfully generate additional revenues from the sale of enhanced ip communications services  including hosted communications solutions or carrier transmission services 
we cannot assure you that a market for our services will develop we are uncertain whether a market will develop for our enhanced ip communications services  including our hosted communications solutions 
our market is new and rapidly evolving 
our ability to sell our services may be inhibited by  among other factors  the reluctance of some end users to switch from traditional communications carriers to ip communications carriers and by concerns with the quality of ip telephony and the adequacy of security in the exchange of information over the internet 
end users in markets serviced by recently deregulated telecommunications providers are not familiar with obtaining services from competitors of these providers and may be reluctant to use new providers  such as us 
our ability to increase revenues depends on the migration of traditional telephone network traffic to our ip network 
we will need to devote substantial resources to educate customers and end users about the benefits of ip communications solutions in general and our services in particular 
if enterprises and their customers do not accept our enhanced ip communications services as a means of sending and receiving communications  we will not be able to increase our number of paid users or successfully generate revenues in the future 
our future success depends on the growth in the use of the internet as a means of communications if the market for ip communications  in general  and our services in particular  does not grow at the rate we anticipate or at all  we will not be able to increase our number of users or generate revenues we anticipate 
to be successful  ip communications requires validation as an effective  quality means of communication and as a viable alternative to traditional telephone service 
demand and market acceptance for recently introduced services are subject to a high level of uncertainty 
the internet may not prove to be a viable alternative to traditional telephone service for reasons including o inconsistent quality or speed of service  o traffic congestion on the internet  o potentially inadequate development of the necessary infrastructure  o lack of acceptable security technologies  o lack of timely development and commercialization of performance improvements  o unavailability of cost effective  high speed access to the internet 
if internet usage grows  the internet infrastructure may not be able to support the demands placed on it by such growth  or its performance or reliability may decline 
in addition  web sites may from time to time experience interruptions in their service as a result of outages and other delays occurring throughout the internet network infrastructure 
if these outages or delays frequently occur in the future  internet usage  as well as usage of our communications portal and our services  could be adversely affected 
potential fluctuations in our quarterly financial results make it difficult for investors to predict our future performance our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of a variety of factors  many of which are outside our control 
the factors generally within our control include o the rate at which we are able to attract users to purchase our enhanced ip communications services  including our hosted communications solutions  o the amount and timing of expenses to enhance marketing and promotion efforts and to expand our infrastructure  o the timing of announcements or introductions of new or enhanced services by us 
the factors outside our control include o the timing of announcements or introductions of new or enhanced services by our competitors  o technical difficulties or network interruptions in the internet or our privately managed network  o general economic and competitive conditions specific to our industry 
the foregoing factors also may create other risks affecting our long term success  as discussed in the other risk factors 
we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our historical operating results may not be a good indication of our future performance  nor would our operating results for any particular quarter be indicative of our future operating results 
our network may not be able to accommodate our capacity needs we expect the volume of traffic we carry over our network to increase significantly as we expand our operations and service offerings 
our network may not be able to accommodate this additional volume 
in order to ensure that we are able to handle additional traffic  we may have to enter into long term agreements for leased capacity 
to the extent that we overestimate our capacity needs  we may be obligated to pay for more transmission capacity than we actually use  resulting in costs without corresponding revenues 
conversely  if we underestimate our capacity needs  we may be required to obtain additional transmission capacity from more expensive sources 
if we are unable to maintain sufficient capacity to meet the needs of our users  our reputation could be damaged and we could lose users 
we face a risk of failure of computer and communications systems used in our business our business depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our computer and communications systems as well as those that connect to our network 
we maintain communications systems in four facilities in new york  los angeles  london and jerusalem 
our systems and those that connect to our network are subject to disruption from natural disasters or other sources of power loss  communications failure  hardware or software malfunction  network failures and other events both within and beyond our control 
any system interruptions that cause our services to be unavailable  including significant or lengthy telephone network failures or difficulties for users in communicating through our network or portal  could damage our reputation and result in a loss of users 
our computer systems and operations may be vulnerable to security breaches our computer infrastructure is potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic computer viruses  break ins and similar disruptive problems and security breaches that could cause interruptions  delays or loss of services to our users 
we believe that the secure transmission of confidential information over the internet  such as credit card numbers  is essential in maintaining user confidence in our services 
we rely on licensed encryption and authentication technology to effect secure transmission of confidential information  including credit card numbers 
it is possible that advances in computer capabilities  new technologies or other developments could result in a compromise or breach of the technology we use to protect user transaction data 
a party that is able to circumvent our security systems could misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions in our operations 
security breaches also could damage our reputation and expose us to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability 
although we have experienced no security breaches to date of which we are aware  we cannot guarantee you that our security measures will prevent security breaches 
third parties might infringe upon our proprietary technology we cannot assure you that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property rights will prevent misappropriation of our proprietary technology 
to protect our rights to our intellectual property  we rely on a combination of trademark and patent law  trade secret protection  confidentiality agreements and other contractual arrangements with our employees  affiliates  strategic partners and others 
we may be unable to detect the unauthorized use of  or take appropriate steps to enforce  our intellectual property rights 
effective copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which we offer or intend to offer our services 
failure to adequately protect our intellectual property could harm our brand  devalue our proprietary content and affect our ability to compete effectively 
further  defending our intellectual property rights could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources 
our services may infringe on the intellectual property rights of others third parties may assert claims that we have violated a patent or infringed a copyright  trademark or other proprietary right belonging to them 
we incorporate licensed third party technology in some of our services 
in these license agreements  the licensors have agreed to indemnify us with respect to any claim by a third party that the licensed software infringes any patent or other proprietary right so long as we have not made changes to the licensed software 
we cannot assure you that these provisions will be adequate to protect us from infringement claims 
any infringement claims  even if not meritorious  could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources 
operating internationally exposes us to additional and unpredictable risks we intend to continue to enter additional markets in eastern europe  latin america  africa and asia and to expand our existing operations outside the united states 
international operations are subject to inherent risks  including o potentially weaker protection of intellectual property rights  o political instability  o unexpected changes in regulations and tariffs  o fluctuations in exchange rates  o varying tax consequences  o uncertain market acceptance and difficulties in marketing efforts due to language and cultural differences 
we have experienced losses as a result of fraud we have experienced losses due to fraud 
while in  we experienced losses from fraud of less than of our revenues  callers have obtained our services without rendering payment by unlawfully using our access numbers and personal identification numbers 
while we have implemented anti fraud measures in order to control losses relating to these practices  and these measures have proven to be effective today  these measures may not in the future be sufficient to effectively limit all of our exposure in the future from fraud and future losses could rise significantly above current levels 
intense competition could reduce our market share and harm our financial performance competition in the market for enhanced ip communications services is becoming increasingly intense and is expected to increase significantly in the future 
the market for enhanced internet and ip communications is new and rapidly evolving 
we expect that competition from companies both in the internet and telecommunications industries will increase in the future 
our competitors include both start up ip telephony service providers and established traditional communications providers 
many of our existing competitors and potential competitors have broader portfolios of services  greater financial  management and operational resources  greater brand name recognition  larger subscriber bases and more experience than we have 
in addition  many of our ip telephony competitors use the internet instead of a private network to transmit traffic 
operating and capital costs of these providers may be less than ours  potentially giving them a competitive advantage over us in terms of pricing 
we also compete in the growing market of discount telecommunications services including calling cards  prepaid cards  call back services  dial around or calling and collect calling services 
in addition  some internet service providers have begun to aggressively enhance their real time interactive communications  focusing initially on instant messaging  although we expect them to begin to provide pc to phone and or broadband phone services 
if we are unable to provide competitive service offerings  we may lose existing users and be unable to attract additional users 
in addition  many of our competitors  especially traditional carriers  enjoy economies of scale that result in a lower cost structure for transmission and related costs  which cause significant pricing pressures within the industry 
although the minutes of use we sell are increasing  revenues are not increasing at the same rate due primarily to a decrease in revenue per minute for our carrier transmission services 
in order to remain competitive we intend to increase our efforts to promote our services  and we cannot be sure that we will be successful in doing this 
in addition to these competitive factors  recent and pending deregulation in some of our markets may encourage new entrants 
we cannot assure you that additional competitors will not enter markets that we plan to serve or that we will be able to compete effectively 
decreasing telecommunications rates may diminish or eliminate our competitive pricing advantage decreasing telecommunications rates may diminish or eliminate the competitive pricing advantage of our services 
international and domestic telecommunications rates have decreased significantly over the last few years in most of the markets in which we operate  and we anticipate that rates will continue to be reduced in all of the markets in which we do business or expect to do business 
users who select our services to take advantage of the current pricing differential between traditional telecommunications rates and our rates may switch to traditional telecommunications carriers as such pricing differentials diminish or disappear  and we will be unable to use such pricing differentials to attract new customers in the future 
in addition  our ability to market our carrier transmission services to telecommunications carriers depends upon the existence of spreads between the rates offered by us and the rates offered by traditional telecommunications carriers  as well as a spread between the retail and wholesale rates charged by the carriers from which we obtain wholesale service 
continued rate decreases will require us to lower our rates to remain competitive and will reduce or possibly eliminate our gross profit from our carrier transmission services 
if telecommunications rates continue to decline  we may lose users for our services 
government regulation and legal uncertainties relating to ip telephony could harm our business historically  voice communications services have been provided by regulated telecommunications common carriers 
we offer voice communications to the public for international and domestic calls using ip telephony  and we do not operate as a licensed telecommunications common carrier in any jurisdiction 
based on specific regulatory classifications and recent regulatory decisions  we believe we qualify for certain exemptions from telecommunications common carrier regulation in many of our markets 
however  the growth of ip telephony has led to close examination of its regulatory treatment in many jurisdictions making the legal status of our services uncertain and subject to change as a result of future regulatory action  judicial decisions or legislation in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
established regulated telecommunications carriers have sought and may continue to seek regulatory actions to restrict the ability of companies such as ours to provide services or to increase the cost of providing such services 
in addition  our services may be subject to regulation if regulators distinguish phone to phone telephony service using ip technologies over privately managed networks such as our services from integrated pc to pc and pc originated voice services over the internet 
some regulators may decide to treat the former as regulated common carrier services and the latter as unregulated enhanced or information services 
application of new regulatory restrictions or requirements to us could increase our costs of doing business and prevent us from delivering our services through our current arrangements 
in such event  we would consider a variety of alternative arrangements for providing our services  including obtaining appropriate regulatory authorizations for our local network partners or ourselves  changing our service arrangements for a particular country or limiting our service offerings 
such regulations could limit our service offerings  raise our costs and restrict our pricing flexibility  and potentially limit our ability to compete effectively 
further  regulations and laws which affect the growth of the internet could hinder our ability to provide our services over the internet 
for a more detailed discussion of the regulation of ip telephony  see business regulation of ip telephony 
we may not be able to keep pace with rapid technological changes in the communications industry our industry is subject to rapid technological change 
we cannot predict the effect of technological changes on our business 
in addition  widely accepted standards have not yet developed for the technologies we use 
we expect that new services and technologies will emerge in the market in which we compete 
these new services and technologies may be superior to the services and technologies that we use  or these new services may render our services and technologies obsolete 
to be successful  we must adapt to our rapidly changing market by continually improving and expanding the scope of services we offer and by developing new services and technologies to meet customer needs 
our success will depend  in part  on our ability to license leading technologies and respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards on a cost effective and timely basis 
we will need to spend significant amounts of capital to enhance and expand our services to keep pace with changing technologies

volatility of our stock price could adversely affect our stockholders since trading commenced in november  the market price of our common stock has been highly volatile and may continue to be volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors such as o variations in our actual or anticipated quarterly operating results or those of our competitors  o announcements by us or our competitors of technological innovations  o introduction of new products or services by us or our competitors  o changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  o conditions or trends in the internet industry  o changes in the market valuations of other internet companies  o announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions  o our entry into strategic partnerships or joint ventures  o sales of our common stock by atarey 
all of these factors are  in whole or part  beyond our control and may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock regardless of our performance 
investors may not be able to resell their shares of our common stock following periods of volatility because of the market s adverse reaction to such volatility 
in addition  the stock market in general  and the market for telecommunications  internet related and technology companies in particular  has been dramatically decreased and is extremely depressed 
we cannot assure you that our common stock will trade at the same levels of other telecommunications or internet stocks or that telecommunications or internet stocks in general will sustain their current market prices 
the liquidity of our common stock could be adversely affected by changes in our nasdaq listing 
our common stock is currently listed on the nasdaq smallcap market 
the listing of our common stock was transferred from the nasdaq national market to the nasdaq smallcap market effective on september  we currently meet all criteria for continued inclusion in the nasdaq smallcap market 
however  based on the volatile nature of our stock price  we can make no assurances that we will continue to do so 
failure to meet these criteria could result in our delisting from the nasdaq smallcap market 
if our shares were to be delisted from the nasdaq smallcap market  our shares would continue to trade  if at all  on the otc bulletin board  upon application by the requisite market makers 
this would adversely impact our stock price  as well as the liquidity of the market for our shares which  as a result  would adversely affect the ability of our stockholders to purchase and sell their shares in an orderly manner  or at all 
furthermore  a delisting of our shares could damage our general business reputation and impair our ability to raise additional funds 
any of the foregoing events could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
we do not intend to pay dividends we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock 
we intend to retain any future earnings to finance our operations and to expand our business and  therefore  do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future
