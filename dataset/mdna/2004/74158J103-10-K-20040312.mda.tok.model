item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our historical consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this form k 
we are a fully integrated  self administered  and self managed real estate investment trust reit which owns  manages  leases  develops  and redevelops office and industrial real estate  primarily in the chicago metropolitan area 
our portfolio of properties consists of office properties  containing an aggregate of million net rentable square feet  and industrial properties  containing an aggregate of million net rentable square feet 
in addition  we own acres of developable land and have joint venture interests in three office properties containing an aggregate of million rentable square feet 
all of our properties are located in the chicago metropolitan area in prime business locations within established business communities and account for all of our rental revenue and tenant reimbursements revenue 
one of our joint venture properties is located in arizona 
our results reflect the general weakness in the economy over the past couple of years  which has resulted in less demand for office and industrial property 
since national and regional office and industrial vacancy rates are higher than they would be in a stronger economic environment  we have been challenged to retain existing tenants and locate new tenants for our vacant and non renewing space at acceptable economic occupancy and rental rates 
the unforeseen demise of arthur andersen llp put a significant amount of additional pressure on our cash flow  liquidity and earnings during in addition  the supply of downtown chicago office space continues to grow  principally as a result of the construction of new office buildings 
as these buildings come on line in the next few years  the additional supply may continue to add to the challenge 
our income and cash flow is derived primarily from rental revenue including tenant reimbursements from our properties 
we expect that any revenue growth over the next several years will come from revenue generated through increased rental and occupancy rates in our portfolio 
the following summarizes our portfolio occupancy at the end of each quarter of and at the end of portfolio occupancy december  september  june  march  december  office industrial portfolio total unconsolidated joint venture properties office occupancy has been significantly affected since december  by the february terminations of the arthur andersen leases 
excluding our west monroe street office building  which was arthur andersen s corporate offices  the overall office occupancy was at december  and the portfolio occupancy was 
it should also be noted that the bank one center office building included in investments in unconsolidated entities was placed in service late in and is still in the lease up phase with occupancy at december  of 
business summary for  our focus was on o retiring or refinancing debt which had maturity dates in and  o reducing our overall debt levels  o stabilizing portfolio cash flow  o reducing operating costs  o aggressively pursuing leasing transactions  and o continuing to explore strategic alternatives 
below is a summary of several of the activities we undertook in in keeping with these objectives 
o we reduced our outstanding indebtedness by million to million at the end of the year from million at the beginning of the year  including the retirement of million of high interest rate debt 
o we purchased our prior partner s interest in the bank one center joint venture in march and then subsequently  in october  sold a interest in the joint venture to a new partner for million 
o we sold our national city center office property in cleveland  ohio for million 
o we refinanced the first mortgage and mezzanine loan secured by our ibm plaza office property with million of new financing 
o we negotiated and received million of lease termination fees from arthur andersen llp 
o we commenced new and expansion office leases totaling  square feet and we renewed office leases totaling  square feet 
o we commenced six new and expansion industrial leases totaling  square feet and we renewed two industrial leases totaling  square feet 
in addition to our day to day operational focus  we continued to evaluate strategic alternatives in consideration of any all opportunities to enhance shareholder value 
on february   we extended the engagement of one of our investment banks  wachovia capital markets  llc through december  key performance indicators we evaluate the performance of our reportable segments based on the occupancy percentages and operating profit of the respective property segment which includes rental revenue  tenant reimbursement revenue  property operations expense and administrative expenses and the allocation of corporate overhead expenses 
we also use other metrics such as gross rent  net occupancy  tenant retention  percent of property operating expenses recovered  results of tenant satisfaction surveys and net effective rent  in analyzing individual tenant lease agreements 
in addition to net income under generally accepted accounting principles  we use funds from operations  which is a measurement tool common among real estate investment trusts for measuring profitability

subsequent to october   we recorded this investment under the equity method of accounting 
lease termination fees 
the increase of million in lease termination fees was primarily due to the february termination of arthur andersen s leases at two of our office properties  which resulted in million of revenue  after deducting outstanding receivables including deferred rent receivable

as distributions to our partner in this joint venture exceeded the joint venture s net income  income equal to the distribution was allocated to our partner and we recorded a loss in the amount of the difference between this allocation and the actual net income of the joint venture 
also contributing to the decrease was a decrease of million in interest income earned on restricted cash due to lower interest rates and lower restricted cash balances 
interest expense

in accordance with sfas  effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   net income and gain loss on sales of real estate for properties sold subsequent to december  are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations as discontinued operations for both periods presented

liquidity and capital resources recent developments 
in december  our board approved the engagement of two investment banks as our financial advisors to assist in the evaluation of strategic alternatives  including  but not limited to  a sale  merger or other business combination involving the company  or a sale of some or all of our assets 
on february   we entered into an engagement letter with one of these advisors  wachovia securities  extending their engagement through december  the engagement of our other financial advisor expired in december our continuing goal is to achieve a desirable result for our shareholders which may include a strategic transaction s and or the continued implementation of our primary business strategy see business business strategy 
there can be no assurances that any transaction or transactions will occur 
we anticipate utilizing net proceeds from any transaction other than a sale of the company whether by merger or otherwise to repay debt  provide working capital to fund capital expenditures  including tenant improvements and leasing commissions  and or distribute them to our shareholders and the common unit holders of our operating partnership 
we may also utilize a portion of any proceeds for general and corporate operating needs and to consummate tax deferred exchanges to minimize any tax exposure under existing tax indemnification agreements 
liquidity 
we require cash to pay our operating expenses  make capital expenditures  fund tenant improvements and leasing costs  pay distributions  and service our debt and other long term liabilities 
net cash provided from operations represents our primary source of liquidity to fund these expenditures 
in assessing our liquidity  key components include our net income adjusted for non cash and non operating items  and current assets and liabilities  in particular accounts receivable  accounts payable  and accrued expenses 
for the longer term  our debt and long term liabilities are also considered key to assessing our liquidity 
in order to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes  we must distribute of our taxable income excluding capital gains annually 
as previously disclosed  due to a number of factors  including our capital requirements in our current operating environment  our board decided to suspend the declaration and payment of distributions on our common shares and series b shares 
in march  our board declared one quarterly distribution of per share on our series b shares for shareholders of record on march   payable on april  under our charter  this distribution is deemed to be a quarterly distribution which relates to the fourth quarter distribution period  the earliest accrued but unpaid quarterly distribution on our series b shares 
there can be no assurances as to the timing and amounts of any future distributions on our series b shares and the payment of the fourth quarter preferred distribution at this time should not be construed to convey any degree of certainty with respect to future preferred distribution payments 
our management and board review our cash position and requirements for cash reserves each quarter prior to making any decision with respect to paying distributions 
we currently do not anticipate declaring or paying distributions on our common shares units for distributions on our common shares may not be made until all accrued distributions on our series b shares are declared and paid or set apart for payment 
future distributions will depend on the actual cash available for distribution  our financial condition  capital requirements  the completion of any capital transactions  including refinancings and asset sales  the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code  and such other factors as our board deems relevant 
based upon our current tax projections  we do not anticipate an obligation to make distributions related to to comply with the annual reit distribution requirements 
we can give no assurances that if any capital transactions are completed on terms favorable to us or otherwise pursuant to our pursuit of strategic alternatives  distributions on our common shares and common units will be resumed either during or thereafter  or that we will be able to pay future distributions on our series b shares 
after i payment of the fourth quarter series b shares distribution referred to above and ii the accrual of the first quarter series b shares distribution  we will be in arrears for five quarters of series b share distributions for a total of million 
our anticipated cash flows from operations are not expected to be sufficient to fund our anticipated short and long term capital needs 
this is principally a result of the current operating results of certain of our properties  including our office property located at west monroe street 
this property s principal tenant was arthur andersen llp which terminated its lease with us in february as a result of this termination  the operating income from this property is not sufficient to fund the property s operating costs and debt service 
in addition  we anticipate substantial costs would need to be incurred to release the vacant space at this property in excess of an existing escrow established at the time of the lease termination for this purpose 
we have funded million of the operating deficits at this property from an escrow established at the time of receipt of arthur andersen llp s lease termination payment 
we are currently pursuing various capital transactions concerning this property including a sale or joint venture 
we can provide no assurance that we will be able to complete a capital transaction with respect to this property  or if one is completed  if it will be on terms which are favorable to us 
during  we anticipate the need to fund significant capital expenditures to retenant space that has been vacated or is anticipated to be vacated during the year 
in addition  we continue to incur and pay certain costs and expenses related to bank one center consisting principally of the funding of a sublease obligation in connection with the lease of an anchor tenant 
we recorded a liability related to this obligation which had a balance of million at december   net of estimated future subleasing 
we anticipate these will be funded out of an existing escrow  which contained million at december   for this purpose 
the financial covenants contained in many of our loan agreements and guarantee agreements with our lenders include minimum ratios for debt service coverage and liabilities as a percentage of total assets  as well as minimum net worth levels  limits as to recourse indebtedness and numerous other financial covenants 
in some past quarters  we have failed to meet certain of these covenants and after negotiations with our lenders and in certain instances  after agreeing to post additional cash collateral  provide other security and or otherwise modify the terms of the relevant loans we have obtained the necessary loan modifications and or waivers 
we did not comply with certain of these ratios with respect to two of our mezzanine loans and the letter of credit facility supporting our industrial revenues bonds for the quarter ended december  and do not expect to comply for the quarter ended march  we have obtained waivers and modifications of these requirements for these periods 
compliance with these covenants for the remainder of is highly dependent on our financial results including but not limited to a failure of one or more of our significant tenants to pay rent when due and could be impacted by future capital events such as asset sales  debt refinancings and new debt or equity transactions 
there can be no assurances that our financial results will be sufficient to enable us to meet these covenants in the future and  if we do not meet a covenant  whether appropriate loan modifications or waivers can be obtained 
at december   we had million of outstanding debt maturing in  including million maturing in january secured by our north lasalle street property  million maturing in may secured by our sequoia drive property and million maturing in november secured by our west monroe street  south lasalle street and jorie plaza properties 
we refinanced the million loan in january  and are in discussions with the other two existing lenders with respect to extensions or refinancing of the remaining maturing indebtedness 
if the necessary extensions or refinancings are not consummated with existing lenders  we may have discussions with other lending sources 
if this indebtedness is not extended  or repaid  the lenders default remedies may hinder our ability to meet financial loan covenants and could result in cross defaults under certain of our other loans 
there can be no assurances as to our ability to obtain funds necessary for the refinancing of these maturing debts 
given our current level of debt  limited availability of unencumbered collateral and our current financing arrangements  we may not be able to obtain additional debt financing at interest rates that are below the rates of return on our properties 
in addition  any equity capital we might raise may be dilutive to our common shareholders

the interest rate ceiling under the agreement is based on a libor index rate of and the interest floor is based on a libor index rate of 
the joint venture would need to make cash escrow deposits to the extent that the liability that results from changes in the instrument s market value exceeds million 
our joint venture partner is the guarantor to the counterparty related to this collar agreement 
if our joint venture partner  as guarantor  were required to pay the counterparty under the terms of the interest rate collar agreement  we have agreed to reimburse our joint venture partner our fifty percent share of any amount paid 
we also have a subordinated interest in a real estate joint venture  which we account for using the equity method  which owns the bank one center office property

the extent and length of this would be impacted by several factors  including o the nature of the financial difficulties  o our ability to obtain control of the space for releasing  o market conditions  o the length of time it would require for us to release the tenant s space  and o whether the tenant s rent was above or below market 
property sales 
on june   we sold our national city center property  a  square foot office building in cleveland  ohio  to an affiliate of national city corporation

under the terms of a million mezzanine note payable collateralized by our west monroe street property and a million mezzanine note payable collateralized by three of our other properties we are required to limit the amount of distributions that can be paid on our preferred and common shares and units to a maximum of of funds from operations as defined in the relevant loan documents for each calendar year 
for purposes of this limitation distributions on series b shares are assumed to have occurred whether or not they are actually paid 
in march  this provision was modified such that provisions for asset impairment and writeoffs of deferred financing fees other than due to regular amortization are excluded from the computation of funds from operations beginning with the quarter ended december  tax indemnity agreements 
in connection with the contribution of certain properties during our initial public offering  we entered into tax indemnification agreements with certain principals affiliated with mr 
edward s 
hadesman  a former executive officer  and certain principals affiliated with mr 
stephen j 
nardi  the chairman of our board 
the terms of these agreements are discussed in note commitments and contingencies to our consolidated financial statements 
in addition  on december   we purchased and amended the mortgage note encumbering the property known as continental towers located in rolling meadows  illinois 
as part of this transaction  we agreed to indemnify the two limited partners of the limited partnership which owns the property for  among other things  the federal and applicable state income tax liabilities that result from the income or gain which they recognize upon refinancing  sale  foreclosure or other action taken by us with respect to the property or the mortgage note 
as discussed above  sales of properties which result in taxable income to parties covered by tax indemnification agreements would create an indemnity obligation on our part to the indemnified party 
in order to mitigate this obligation  we may enter into tax deferred exchange transactions  which would defer the tax sale and related indemnity obligation 
proceeds available to us from sales of properties covered by tax indemnification agreements would be reduced by the amount necessary to fund any indemnity payment or to purchase properties to satisfy tax deferred exchange transactions

additionally  we retired million in bonds as a result of the sale of our tennessee property

funds from operations industry analysts generally consider funds from operations  as defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit  an alternative measure of performance of an equity reit 
funds from operations is defined by nareit as net income loss determined in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of depreciable operating property  plus depreciation and amortization other than amortization of deferred financing costs and depreciation of non real estate assets and after adjustment for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures and discontinued operations primarily for adding back the effect of gains losses on sale of depreciable operating property and depreciation and amortization expense 
non recurring items  other than those considered extraordinary under gaap  are not adjustments to funds from operations 
we believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our combined historical operating results  funds from operations should be examined in conjunction with net income loss as presented in the financial statements included elsewhere in this form k

funds from operations ffo is defined as net income loss  computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap plus real estate depreciation and amortization  excluding gains or losses from sales of operating properties  and after comparable adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures and discontinued operations 
ffo includes results from discontinued operations  including revenues  property operations expense  real estate taxes expense  provision for asset impairment and interest expense 
we compute ffo in accordance with standards established by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit  which may not be comparable to ffo reported by other reits that do not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition or that interpret the current nareit definition differently than us 
we utilize ffo as a performance measure 
we believe that ffo provides useful information to investors regarding our performance as ffo provides investors with additional means of comparing our operating performance with the operating performance of our competitors 
ffo is not representative of cash flow from operations  is not indicative that cash flows are adequate to fund all cash needs  and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity 
we believe that net income loss is the most directly comparable gaap financial measure to ffo 
depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended december  increased million representing an entire year of depreciation and amortization related to bank one center  which was placed into service as of november   and a million write off of unamortized tenant improvements and leasing commissions associated with the termination of arthur andersen s leases at two chicago office properties

the existing agreement also provides that pgi is entitled to use the proceeds from certain pending litigation we have against third parties relating to these environmental liabilities 
the amendment to the agreement provides  among other things  that all of the proceeds from the litigation will not be funded to pgi or its affiliate  but instead that if any proceeds are recovered in connection with the litigation  sufficient proceeds if recovered will instead be placed in an escrow to be used to fund the environmental remediation costs 
we are aware of environmental contamination at certain of our older industrial properties contributed to us as an equity contribution by pgi during our initial public offering 
upon the closing of the admission of a new joint venture partner to our subsidiary that owns bank one center  we retained million of the million of compensation due pgi  as described below  which will be utilized towards certain environmental costs at these industrial properties 
pgi s responsibility under the agreement was correspondingly reduced by million 
as of december  a total of million of these costs have been paid 
these environmental matters are set forth in the section entitled business government regulations environmental matters 
in connection with the admission of a new joint venture partner to the joint venture that owns the  square foot bank one center office building in chicago  illinois  we entered into certain agreements with affiliates of pgi  providing for a total of million of compensation in connection with certain advisory services performed in connection with the transaction

pgi leased  square feet of space at west wacker drive  an office building owned by one of our unconsolidated real estate joint ventures of which we own a common ownership interest 
pgi s lease was to expire october  with an option  effective april   to terminate the lease upon six months written notice

we are required to indemnify the ibd contributors and nac contributors for  among other things  certain income tax liabilities based on income or gain the ibd contributors and nac contributors are required to include in their gross income for federal or state income tax purposes upon the refinancing or repayment by us of their liabilities or the sale or other disposition by us of the properties they contributed 
these indemnities cover such income taxes  interest and penalties and are required to be made on a grossed up basis that effectively results in the ibd contributors and nac contributors receiving the indemnity payments on a net  after tax basis

critical accounting policies general 
the previous discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments about the effects of matters or future events that are inherently uncertain 
these estimates and judgments may affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including contingencies and litigation 
we base these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable in the circumstances 
these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
to assist in understanding our results of operations and financial position  we have identified our critical accounting policies and discussed them below 
these accounting policies are most important to the portrayal of our results and financial position  either because of the significance of the financial statement items to which they relate or because they require our management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we monitor the liquidity and creditworthiness of our tenants on an ongoing basis 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts using the specific identification method for estimated losses resulting from the inability of certain of our tenants to make payments required by the terms of their respective leases 
no general reserve is recorded 
if the financial condition of our tenants were to deteriorate  additional allowances may be required 
deferred tax asset 
we account for income taxes payable by our services company in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
sfas also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
at december   we had deferred tax assets in excess of deferred tax liabilities of million included in other assets in our consolidated balance sheet 
the deferred tax assets in excess of deferred tax liabilities decreased approximately million during primarily due to million of pretax income of the services company generated principally from tenant services and management fee income 
we evaluate quarterly the realizability of our deferred tax assets by assessing the valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of the allowance  if necessary 
the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are our forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax 
we have used tax planning strategies to realize or renew net deferred tax assets in order to avoid the potential loss of future tax benefits 
approximately million of future taxable income earned by our services company is ultimately required to realize the net deferred tax assets at december  this is based on the recognition in future years by the services company of taxable income anticipated from certain build to suit activities  lease commissions and property management fees 
failure to achieve forecasted taxable income might affect the ultimate realization of the net deferred tax assets described above 
factors that may affect our ability to achieve sufficient forecasted taxable income include  but are not limited to  unanticipated decreases in the profitability of build to suit activities and or the sale of properties and subsequent loss of the related management contracts 
assumed lease liabilities 
as a result of the negotiation of certain leases  we assumed the liability for the tenants obligation or agreed to reimburse the tenants for their obligation under leases with their prior landlords 
in addition  in connection with the sale of certain industrial properties in  we agreed to a master lease agreement for certain properties for a defined period 
our policy is to record the estimated net obligation we may be subject to as a liability 
the net obligation is derived by calculating our total contractual obligation and reducing the amount by existing subleases and an estimate of subleases we anticipate signing in the future based on the nature of the space  the property and market conditions 
we periodically review these estimates for reasonableness based on changes in market conditions and executed subleases 
failure to achieve forecasted results could lead to a future increase in the liabilities associated with these transactions 
the liability for leases assumed at december  reflects payments under these leases  net of an increase in the liability of million due to assumption changes 
provisions for impairment 
in evaluating our assets for impairment in accordance with sfas  we record impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired 
under sfas  assets that display indicators of possible impairment are reviewed to see if their net book value will be recovered from estimated cash flows over an anticipated hold period 
if these cash flows  plus the proceeds from a sale at the end of the anticipated hold period  are less than the net book value of our related asset  our policy is to record an impairment reserve related to the asset in the amount of the difference between its net book value and our estimate of its fair market value  less costs of sale 
for assets held for sale  impairment is measured as the difference between carrying value and fair value  less cost to dispose 
fair value is based on estimated cash flows discounted at a risk adjusted rate of interest 
property held for future development and property under development are also evaluated for impairment 
impairment is determined for development costs associated with property held for future development and property under development based upon management s assessment that these costs have no future value 
at december   we determined that a reserve in the amount of million related to our west monroe street property was warranted 
we also recorded a reserve of million in the third quarter of related to the bank one center office property 
in evaluating our other long lived assets used in operations for impairment at december   we assumed anticipated hold periods of three to five years for our operating properties 
in evaluating our property held for development  we concluded that a reserve for one of our projects was warranted in the amount of million  as we determined costs associated with the project no longer had value 
for our other property held for development  we concluded that development expenditures  including capitalized interest  were recoverable and no reserves were warranted at this time 
however  as discussed under liquidity and capital resources  if we determined that a capital transaction is desired  our anticipated hold periods for certain assets would be shortened and impairment reserves would be required 
these reserves would have significant impacts on our operating results 
capitalization of interest and other costs on development projects 
development costs  which include land acquisition costs  fees and other costs incurred in developing new properties  are capitalized as incurred 
interest  financing costs  real estate taxes  other direct costs and indirect costs including certain employee compensation costs and related general and administrative expenses incurred during development periods are capitalized as a component of the building costs 
these costs continue to be capitalized  to the extent they relate to vacant space  for one year following the date the development is placed in service 
during this one year period  the amount of capitalized costs could be materially affected by the timing and changes in occupancy levels 
subsequent to the one year period  these costs are fully expensed as incurred 
during  we capitalized interest and other costs related to bank one center based upon the proportion of the vacant space at the property to the total property 
this capitalization ceased upon admittance of a partner to the entity which owns bank one center 
as none of our other development holdings are undergoing development activities  we are no longer capitalizing these costs 
impact of recently issued accounting standards in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities interpretation  which requires the consolidation of an entity by an enterprise i if that enterprise  known as a primary beneficiary  has a variable interest that will absorb a majority of the entity s expected losses if they occur  receive a majority of the entity s expected residual returns if they occur  or both and ii if the entity is a variable interest entity  as defined by interpretation we adopted interpretation in the fourth quarter of and do not believe that the adoption of this interpretation has a material effect on our financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity fas 
fas established standards for classifying and measuring as liabilities certain financial instruments that embody obligations of the issuer and have characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
fas generally requires liability classification of mandatorily redeemable financial instruments  including minority interests in limited life subsidiaries 
the liability for the mandatorily redeemable financial instruments should be recorded at fair value 
any difference between fair value and the redemption or settlement amount would be accreted through interest expense 
in october  the fasb decided to indefinitely delay the effective date of the provisions of fas related to finite life entities and also indicated that it may modify other guidance in fas in its original form  we did not anticipate fas having any effect on our financial statements 
however  that assessment may change if the fasb modifies the guidance in fas inflation substantially all of our office and industrial leases require tenants to pay  as additional rent  a portion of real estate taxes and operating expenses
