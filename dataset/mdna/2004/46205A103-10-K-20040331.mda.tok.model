item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction overview we are a network television broadcasting company which owns and operates the largest broadcast television station group in the us  as measured by the number of television households in the markets our stations serve 
we currently own and operate broadcast television stations including three stations we operate under time brokerage agreements  which reach all of the top us markets and of the top us markets 
we operate pax tv  a network that provides programming seven days per week  hours per day  and reaches approximately million homes  or of prime time television households in the us  through our broadcast television station group  and pursuant to distribution arrangements with cable and satellite distribution systems and our broadcast station affiliates 
pax tv s entertainment programming principally consists of shows originally developed by us and shows that have appeared previously on other broadcast networks which we have purchased the right to air 
the balance of pax tv s programming consists of long form paid programming principally infomercials and public interest programming 
our primary operating expenses include selling  general and administrative expenses  depreciation and amortization expenses  programming expenses  employee compensation and costs associated with cable and satellite distribution  ratings services and promotional advertising 
programming amortization is a significant expense and is affected by several factors  including the mix of syndicated versus lower cost original programming as well as the frequency with which programs are aired 
we believe that absent significant improvement in our ratings and revenues  our business operations are unlikely to provide sufficient cash flow to support our debt service and preferred stock dividend requirements 
in september  we engaged bear  stearns co 
inc and in august  we engaged citigroup global markets inc to act as our financial advisors to assess our business plan  capital structure and future capital needs  and to explore strategic alternatives for our company 
these strategic alternatives may include the sale of all or part of our assets  finding a strategic partner for our company who would provide the financial resources to enable us to redeem  restructure or refinance our debt and preferred stock  or finding a third party to acquire our company through a merger or other business combination or through a purchase of our equity securities 
see forward looking statements and associated risks and uncertainties the outcome of our exploration of strategic alternatives is uncertain 
restatements of financial information from through  we acquired several television stations in transactions structured as the purchase of the outstanding stock of the entity owning the station 
in each of these transactions  we failed to establish the proper deferred tax liability for the difference between the book basis and tax basis of the acquired station s fcc license as required under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
further  in connection with our analysis of prior acquisitions  we determined that in certain acquisitions we had understated the value of fcc licenses 
additionally  we determined that goodwill should not have been recorded for certain acquisitions that were fundamentally purchases of assets 
we have corrected this matter by reclassifying million from goodwill to fcc license intangible assets 
set forth below are the restatement adjustments included in the restatement of our previously issued financial statements 
the recording of deferred tax liabilities resulting from the stock acquisitions described above has resulted in additional fcc license intangible assets amounting to approximately million 
the increased amount of our fcc license intangible assets has resulted in additional amortization expense of approximately million in the year ended december  million in the period from january  through december  
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets at which time indefinite lived intangible assets were no longer amortized 
the deferred tax liabilities associated with these additional fcc license intangible assets has  in periods subsequent to the respective acquisition  resulted in the realization of previously unrecognized deferred tax assets generated by net operating losses as we considered the reversal of deferred tax liabilities related to fcc license intangible assets as a source of future taxable income in assessing the realization of deferred tax assets up until the adoption of sfas no 
the realization of deferred tax assets has resulted in a deferred tax benefit of million in the period from january  through december  the increased amount of our fcc license intangible assets resulting from these acquisitions has been considered in the determination of any gain or loss upon the disposition of the related assets 
as a result  we have recognized additional losses on the sale of broadcast assets of approximately million in the year ended december  million in the period from january  through december  
in each case in which an acquisition was consummated at a time when we had unrecognized deferred tax assets resulting from net operating losses  the recording of deferred tax liabilities resulting from the stock acquisitions has resulted in their realization 
the realization of these additional deferred tax assets had no effect on our financial statements until the adoption of sfas no 
however  upon the adoption of sfas no 
in the first quarter of  we no longer amortized our fcc license intangible assets 
under previous accounting standards  these assets were being amortized over years 
although the provisions of sfas no 
stipulate that indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized  we are required under sfas no 
accounting for income taxes  to recognize deferred tax liabilities and assets for temporary differences related to the fcc license intangible assets and the tax deductible portion of these assets 
because indefinite lived intangible assets were no longer amortized for financial reporting purposes under sfas no 
 the related deferred tax liabilities will not reverse until some indeterminate future period should the fcc license intangible assets become impaired or be disposed of 
therefore the reversal of deferred tax liabilities related to the fcc license intangible assets was no longer considered a source of future taxable income in assessing the realization of deferred tax assets 
as a result  upon adoption of sfas no 
in the first quarter of  we have recorded an additional provision for income taxes in connection with the deferred tax liabilities resulting from stock acquisitions of approximately million 
we have restated our previously issued financial statements to correct the items described in the preceding paragraphs 
the cumulative effect of the aforementioned adjustments is a decrease in our accumulated deficit as of december  of million  from million  as originally reported  to million  as restated 
we have determined that it would be appropriate to restate our and financial statements  and to restate the financial information previously reported in the first quarter of unless otherwise specifically noted  the financial information in this form k reflects the restatement  the restatement  and the first quarter restatement 
for information concerning the restatement of our quarterly results of operations  see note of our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein 
the following sets forth the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of december  and the condensed consolidated statements of operations for and as originally reported and as restated in thousands  except per share data as of december  as originally reported adjustments as restated assets current assets   intangible assets  net    property  equipment and other assets  net   total assets    liabilities  mandatorily redeemable preferred stock and stockholders deficit current liabilities   deferred income taxes    senior subordinated notes and bank financing  net of current portion   other long term liabilities   total liabilities    mandatorily redeemable and convertible preferred stock   total stockholders deficit    total liabilities  mandatorily redeemable and stockholders deficit    after considering reclassifications to conform to the presentation

 goodwill and other intangible assets 
o cash flow from operating activities was million in  an improvement of million compared to negative million in balance sheet our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments increased during the year by million to million as of december  our total debt  which primarily comprises three series of notes  increased million during the year to million as of december  additionally  we have three series of mandatorily redeemable preferred stock currently outstanding with an aggregate redemption value of billion as of december  two series of the notes require us to make periodic cash interest payments on a current basis 
interest on the third series of notes accretes until july  at which time we will be obligated to make cash interest payments on a current basis 
all series of preferred stock accrue dividends but do not require current cash dividend payments 
none of these instruments matures or requires mandatory principal repayments until the fourth quarter of during we issued letters of credit to support our obligation to pay for certain original programming 
we expect to continue to issue letters of credit in the settlement of such letters of credit generally occurs during the first quarter of the year 
as a result of this strategy  our programming payments may be higher in the first quarter of the year compared to the other three quarters of the year 
sources of cash our principal sources of cash in were o revenues from the sale of network long form paid programming  network spot advertising  station long form paid programming and station spot advertising  and o million in proceeds from the sale of broadcast assets  principally consisting of television stations 
we expect our principal sources of cash in to consist of o revenues from the sale of network long form paid programming  network spot advertising  station long form paid programming and station spot advertising  and o million in proceeds from our remaining planned television station sale 
key company performance indicators we use a number of key performance indicators to evaluate and manage our business 
one of the key indicators related to the performance of our long form paid programming is long form advertising rates 
these rates can be affected by the number of television outlets through which long form advertisers can air their programs  weather patterns which can affect viewing levels  and new product introductions 
we monitor early indicators such as how new products are performing and our ability to increase or decrease rates for given time slots 
program ratings are one of the key indicators related to our network spot business 
as more viewers watch our programming  our ratings increase which can increase our revenues 
the commitments we obtain from advertisers in the up front market are a leading indicator of the potential performance of our network spot revenues 
as the year progresses  we monitor pricing in the scatter market to determine where network spot advertising rates are trending 
cost per thousand cpm s refers to the price of reaching  television viewing households with an advertisement 
cpm trends and comparisons to competitors cpm s can be used to determine pricing power and the appeal of the audience demographic that we are delivering to advertisers 
in order to evaluate our local market performance  we examine ratings as well as our cost per point  which is the price we charge an advertiser to reach one percent of the total television viewing households in a station s dma  as measured by nielsen 
we also examine the percentage of the market advertising revenue that our local stations are receiving compared to the share of the market ratings that we are delivering 
the economic health of a particular region or certain industries that are concentrated in a particular region can affect the amount being spent on local television advertising 
factors expected to affect our performance in during  we demonstrated significant improvements in cash flow from operating activities and an increase in total cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
the increase in our total cash  cash equivalents and short term investments was primarily due to the sale of certain television stations 
we have one remaining planned station sale which is expected to close during the second quarter of we have no current plans to continue to increase the total amount of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments on our balance sheet through asset sales during additionally  we do not anticipate that we will generate sufficient cash flows from operating activities to cover our anticipated capital expenditures for the year ending december  accordingly  our total cash  cash equivalents and short term investments as of december  is not expected to increase as it did in and is expected to decrease during the course of the broadcasting industry will be affected in by spending on political advertising and during the olympic games 
typically  years that contain political and olympic advertising show strong performance for television spot advertising for the industry in general 
while we are not a direct beneficiary of a material amount of political advertising  we expect to benefit from the decrease in advertising inventory generally available in the local marketplace 
conversely  the broadcast of the olympics in august could cause lower ratings due to strong competition from olympic programming 
the potential for lower ratings and the possibility that non olympics advertisers may suspend their typical advertising programs during the olympics could negatively affect our business 
the us economic environment also affects the performance of our business  since our business is dependent in part on cyclical advertising rates 
an improving economy  led by increases in consumer confidence  could benefit us by leading advertisers to increase their spending 
outlook for in order for us to improve ratings and revenues in  we would need to market and air programming that attracts additional viewers  increase our cpm s through delivery of more attractive viewing demographics or realize increases in long form paid programming rates 
as long form programming is not currently in a high growth cycle  we expect that our revenues in this segment for will be relatively unchanged when compared to as a result of the restructuring we commenced in the fourth quarter of  we believe that our ability to further reduce costs is limited 
in fact  we expect that we will experience increases in operating expenses during resulting from increased utility costs to broadcast our digital television signal and other contractual increases in operating expenses 
during  we also do not anticipate that we will have the benefit of a reduction in expenses related to certain beneficial legal settlements  similar to those that we received during the year ended december  critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we believe the most significant estimates involved in preparing our financial statements include estimates related to the net realizable value of our programming rights  barter revenue recognition  estimates used in accounting for leases and estimates related to the impairment of long lived assets and fcc licenses 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions we believe are reasonable 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we consider the accounting policies described below to be critical since they have the greatest effect on our reported financial condition and results of operations and they require significant estimates and judgments 
we carry programming rights assets on our balance sheet at the lower of unamortized cost or net realizable value 
we periodically evaluate the net realizable value of our program rights based on anticipated future usage of programming and the anticipated future ratings and related advertising revenues 
we evaluate the net realizable value of our programming rights by aggregating the program costs and related estimated future revenues for each programming daypart 
if estimated future revenues are insufficient to recover the unamortized cost of the programming assets in each daypart  we record an adjustment to write down the value of our assets to net realizable value 
we also evaluate whether future revenues will be sufficient to recover the cost of programs we are committed to purchase in the future  and if estimated future revenues are insufficient  we accrue a loss related to our programming commitments 
our estimates of future advertising revenues are based upon our actual revenues generated currently  adjusted for estimated revenue growth assumptions 
if market conditions were to deteriorate  we may not achieve our estimated future revenues  which could result in future write downs to net realizable value and accrued losses on programming commitments 
we have made judgments and estimates in connection with some of our leasing transactions regarding the estimated useful lives of the assets subject to lease  as well as the discount rates used to estimate the present value of future lease payments 
these judgments and estimates have led us to conclude that these leases should be accounted for as operating leases 
had we used different judgments and estimates  these leases may have been classified as capital leases 
the terms of our senior notes indenture  senior subordinated notes indentures and outstanding preferred stock restrict our ability to incur indebtedness  including our ability to enter into capital leases 
we review our long lived assets for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that  based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows  the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable 
if our analysis indicates that a possible impairment exists  we are required to then estimate the fair value of the asset determined either by third party appraisal or estimated discounted future cash flows 
in addition  our fcc licenses are tested for impairment at least annually by comparing the estimated fair values with the recorded amount on an aggregate basis as a single unit of accounting since we operate pax tv as a single asset  a consolidated distribution platform 
we believe that we have made reasonable estimates and judgments in determining whether our long lived assets and fcc licenses have been impaired 
if  however  there were a material change in our determination of fair values or if there were a material change in the conditions or circumstances influencing fair value  we could be required to recognize an impairment charge 
in addition  it is possible that the estimated life of certain long lived assets will be reduced significantly in the near term because of the anticipated industry migration from analog to digital broadcasting 
if and when we become aware of such a reduction of useful lives  depreciation expense will be adjusted prospectively to ensure assets are fully depreciated upon migration 
we recognize revenues as commercial spots and long form paid programming are aired and ratings guarantees to advertisers are achieved 
we recognize a liability for shortfalls in ratings guarantees based on information obtained from third party sources and by using our judgment and best estimates 
we carry accounts receivable at the amount we believe to be collectible 
we use our judgment and best estimates in determining the amount of accounts receivable we believe to be uncollectible 
the amounts of accounts receivable that ultimately become uncollectible could vary materially from our estimates 
we have entered into agreements with cable system operators to improve channel positioning on certain cable systems 
for agreements with specified termination dates  we amortize amounts paid over the term of the agreement using the straight line method 
for agreements with no specified termination date  we amortize amounts paid on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives 
we depreciate property and equipment over their estimated useful lives using the straight line method 
we periodically evaluate the potential time frame in which certain equipment may become obsolete as a result of the fcc mandated conversion from analog to digital to determine whether accelerated depreciation is necessary 
we have not determined whether accelerated depreciation should be used to depreciate any of our property and equipment and we continue to depreciate our property and equipment over their estimated useful lives 
we account for employee stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method 
we have investments in certain broadcast properties  including purchase options in entities owning television stations 
we review our investments in broadcast properties for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable 
if our analysis indicates that a possible impairment exists  we are required to estimate the fair value of the asset based either on a third party appraisal or estimated discounted future cash flows 
we believe we have made reasonable estimates and judgments in determining whether our investments in broadcast properties are impaired 
we structured the disposition of our radio division in and our acquisition of television stations during the period following this disposition in a manner that we believed would qualify these transactions as a like kind exchange under section of the internal revenue code and would permit us to defer recognizing for income tax purposes up to approximately million of gain 
the irs has examined our tax return and has issued us a day letter proposing to disallow all of our gain deferral 
we have filed our protest to this determination with the irs appeals division  but we cannot predict the outcome of this matter at this time  and we may not prevail 
in addition  the day letter offered an alternative position that  in the event the irs is unsuccessful in disallowing all of the gain deferral  approximately million of the million gain deferral will be disallowed 
we have filed a protest to this alternative determination as well 
we may not prevail with respect to this alternative determination 
should the irs successfully challenge our position and disallow all or part of our gain deferral  because we had net operating losses in the years subsequent to in excess of the amount of the deferred gain  we would not be liable for any tax deficiency  but could be liable for interest on the tax liability for the period prior to the carryback of our net operating losses 
we have estimated the amount of interest for which we could be held liable to be approximately million as of december  should the irs succeed in disallowing all of the deferred gain 
if the irs were successful only in disallowing part of the gain under its alternative position  we estimate we would be liable for only a nominal amount of interest 
results of continuing operations the following table sets forth net revenues  the components of operating expenses with percentages of net revenues  and other operating data for the periods presented in thousands years ended december restated restated gross revenues    less agency commissions    net revenues    expenses programming and broadcast operations 
   program rights amortization    selling  general and administrative    business interruption insurance proceeds  time brokerage and affiliation fees    stock based compensation    adjustment of programming to net realizable value    restructuring charges credits   reserve for state taxes  depreciation and amortization    total operating expenses    gain on sale or disposal of broadcast and other assets  net    operating income loss    other data cash flows provided by used in operating activities    cash flows provided by used in investing activities    cash flows used in provided by financing activities    program rights payments and deposits    payments for cable distribution rights 
   capital expenditures    years ended december  and restated results of operations for gross revenues decreased to million for the year ended december  versus million for the year ended december  this decrease is primarily attributable to the sale of certain television stations 
programming and broadcast operations expenses were million during the year ended december   compared with million in this increase is primarily due to higher tower rent and utilities expense in connection with our digital television build out 
program rights amortization expense was million during the year ended december  compared with million in the decrease is primarily due to the modification of our programming schedule in january whereby we replaced daytime entertainment programming with long form paid programming for which we have no programming cost and due to the sub licensing of touched by an angel to crown media described below 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million during the year ended december  compared with in the decrease is primarily a result of cost cutting measures including headcount reductions in connection with the fourth quarter restructuring activities described below  lower legal expenses primarily resulting from completion  in  of the nbc arbitration matter and a charge recorded in in connection with the postponement of the mhz spectrum auction 
in addition  during the first quarter of  we received approximately million from nbc to settle a pending dispute regarding digital television signal interference at our television station wpxm  serving the miami fort lauderdale  florida market 
this settlement was recorded as a reduction of our selling  general and administrative expenses 
additionally  we reduced our bad debt reserve by approximately million because of the decrease in our receivables that resulted from our shift in to more prepaid long form advertising 
during the year ended december   we recognized an adjustment of programming to net realizable value totaling million resulting from our decision to no longer air an original game show production 
in  we recorded a reserve for state taxes related to current and prior periods in the amount of million in connection with a tax liability related to certain states in which we have operations 
depreciation and amortization expense was million during the year ended december  compared with million in this decrease is due to the sale of broadcast assets and our determination to amortize our remaining cable distribution rights over the remaining term of the underlying agreements 
in  we began entering into cable distribution agreements for periods generally up to ten years in markets where we do not own a television station 
certain of these cable distribution agreements also provided us with some level of promotional advertising to be run at the discretion of the cable operator  primarily during the first few years to support the launch of the pax tv network on the cable systems 
we had been amortizing these assets on an accelerated basis  which gave effect to the advertising component included in these agreements 
the remaining unamortized cost  which was being amortized over seven years  will be amortized over the remaining contractual life of the agreements 
in  we determined that we had previously over amortized certain of these assets and recorded a million reduction of amortization expense 
the decrease in depreciation and amortization expense was offset  in part  by an impairment charge in the amount of million recorded in in connection with a purchase option on a television station 
this impairment existed in periods prior to in may  we completed the sale of our television station kapx  serving the albuquerque  new mexico market  for million resulting in a pre tax gain of approximately million 
in april  we completed the sale of our television stations wmpx  serving the portland auburn  maine market  and wpxo  serving the st 
croix  us virgin islands market  for an aggregate of million resulting in a pre tax gain of approximately million 
in april  we completed the sale of our limited partnership interest in television station wwdp  serving the boston  massachusetts market  for approximately million resulting in a pre tax gain of approximately million 
in february  we completed the sale of our television station kpxf  serving the fresno  california market  for million resulting in a pre tax gain of approximately million 
in october  we granted  options under our stock incentive plan  as amended the plan  to purchase one share of our class a common stock at an exercise price of per share to certain employees and directors 
the options provided for a one business day exercise period 
all holders of the options exercised their options and received class a common stock subject to vesting restrictions 
the awards included retention grants totaling  shares which will vest in their entirety at the end of a five year period 
of the remaining awards   will vest ratably over a three year period and  will vest ratably over a five year period 
the option grants resulted in non cash stock based compensation expense of approximately million  which will be recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the awards 
for the year ended december   we recognized approximately million in stock based compensation expense in connection with these grants 
approximately million will be recognized in  and the remaining million will be recognized between and in january  we consummated a stock option exchange offer under which we granted to holders who tendered their eligible options in the exchange offer new options under the plan to purchase one share of our class a common stock for each two shares of our class a common stock issuable upon the exercise of tendered options  at an exercise price of per share 
because the terms of the new options provided for a one business day exercise period  all holders who tendered their eligible options in the exchange offer exercised their new options promptly after the issuance of those new options 
approximately million options issued under our stock option plans and million non qualified options issued in addition to the options granted under our stock option plans were tendered in the exchange offer and approximately million new shares of class a common stock were issued upon exercise of the new options  net of approximately million shares of class a common stock withheld  in accordance with the plan s provisions  at the holders elections to cover withholding taxes and the option exercise price totaling approximately million 
the stock option exchange resulted in a non cash stock based compensation expense of approximately million  of which approximately million related to vested and unvested shares issued upon exercise of the new options was recognized in the year ended december  and the remaining million will be recognized on a straight line basis over the remaining vesting period of the modified awards 
in addition  the remaining deferred stock compensation expense associated with the original stock option awards totaling approximately million at december  associated with tendered options is being recognized on a straight line basis over the remaining vesting period of the modified awards million recognized in the year ended december  interest expense for the year ended december  increased to million from million in the increase is primarily due to higher accretion on our senior subordinated discount notes 
dividends on mandatorily redeemable preferred stock resulted from the classification of our junior exchangeable preferred stock as a liability in accordance with sfas see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations new accounting pronouncements for additional discussion of sfas and its effect on the classification of our mandatorily redeemable preferred stock 
interest income for the year ended december  increased to million from million in the increase is primarily due to higher average cash and short term investment balances in resulting from proceeds from asset sales 
restated results of operations years ended december  and gross revenues increased to million for the year ended december  from million for this increase is primarily attributable to higher station and network advertising revenues 
television station revenues increased primarily due to increased television spot advertising revenues in our local markets and favorable results from our jsa agreements 
network spot revenues increased and network long form revenues increased compared to primarily due to increased distribution of pax tv 
our revenues during the years ended december  and were negatively affected by the temporary loss and continued impairment of the broadcast signal of our new york television station when our antenna  transmitter and other broadcast equipment were destroyed upon the collapse of the world trade center on september  we are currently broadcasting from a tower located on the empire state building in manhattan  and are continuing to evaluate several alternatives to improve our signal through transmission from other locations 
we expect  however  that it could take several years to replace the signal we enjoyed at the world trade center location with a comparable signal 
the loss of a significant portion of our over the air viewership in the new york market has had a negative effect on our revenues as a result of lower ratings for the pax tv network and our station serving the new york market 
we have property and business interruption insurance coverage to mitigate the losses sustained 
insurance recoveries are recognized in the period they become probable of collection and can be reasonably estimated 
during  we received million of insurance proceeds  million of which related to property extra expense and million related to business interruption 
we are involved in litigation with our insurer over these matters and are presently unable to estimate the amount of additional insurance proceeds we will receive  if any 
programming and broadcast operations expenses were million during the year ended december  compared with million in this increase is primarily due to higher music license fees and tower rent expense for previously owned towers that we sold in program rights amortization expense was million during the year ended december  compared with million for the decrease is due to a greater mix of lower cost original programming as compared with as well as the lower carrying value of our programming assets resulting from net realizable value adjustments 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million during the year ended december  compared with million for the increase is primarily due to legal costs associated with the nbc arbitration and the mhz spectrum auction  higher advertising expenses associated with the launch of our broadcast season and higher insurance costs 
stock based compensation expense was million during the year ended december  compared with million for this decrease is due to a reduction in options vesting in the year ended december  compared with the programming rights adjustment to net realizable value described below was million during the year ended december  compared with million for depreciation and amortization expense was million during the year ended december  compared with million for this decrease is due primarily to the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  sfas which requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives  including fcc license intangible assets  be tested for impairment annually rather than amortized over time 
as a result of the new accounting standard  our amortization expense is now significantly lower as we no longer amortize our fcc license intangible assets 
during we issued options to purchase shares of class a common stock to certain members of management and employees under our stock compensation plans 
as of december   there were  options outstanding under these plans 
in addition to these options  we granted options to purchase  shares of class a common stock to members of senior management and others 
in connection with option grants  we recognized stock based compensation expense of approximately million and million in and  respectively 
as previously described  in january  we modified our programming schedule by reducing the number of hours of entertainment programming on the pax tv network primarily during the daytime period and replacing such hours with long form paid programming 
as a result of this change  we no longer plan to air certain syndicated and original programs 
therefore  we revised our estimate of the future advertising revenues to be generated related to these programs and recognized a charge of approximately million in the fourth quarter of related to these programming assets 
additionally  as further described below  in the second quarter of we recorded a million accrued programming loss related to programming commitments for touched by an angel 
in  we adjusted our estimate of the anticipated future usage of touched by an angel and certain other syndicated programs and the related advertising revenues expected to be generated and recognized a charge of approximately million related to the net realizable value of these programming assets and related programming commitments 
the charge included a million accrued loss related to programming commitments for future seasons of touched by an angel 
as further described below  in we sublicensed the programming rights to touched by an angel to the hallmark channel 
interest expense for the year ended december  increased to million from million in the increase is primarily due to a greater level of senior debt due to our refinancings in july and january and borrowings to fund capital expenditures 
at december   total long term debt and senior subordinated notes were million compared with million as of december  although the july and january refinancings reduced our overall cost of capital  the refinancings increased our debt and reduced our preferred stock  and as a result our interest expense increased in interest income for the year ended december  decreased to million from million in the decrease is due to lower cash and investment balances and lower interest rates 
during the year ended december   we sold our television station wpxb serving the merrimack  new hampshire market to nbc for million and realized a pre tax gain of approximately million 
as further described below  during we recorded an increase in our deferred tax asset valuation allowance totaling approximately million resulting from changes in accounting for the amortization of our fcc license intangible assets upon adoption of sfas restructuring activities during the fourth quarter of  we adopted a plan to consolidate certain of our operations  reduce personnel and modify our programming schedule in order to significantly reduce our cash operating expenditures 
in connection with this plan  we recorded a restructuring charge of approximately million in the fourth quarter of consisting of million in termination benefits for employees and million in costs associated with exiting leased properties and the consolidation of certain operations 
through december   we have paid million in termination benefits to employees and paid million of lease termination and other costs 
we have accounted for these costs pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities which we early adopted in the fourth quarter of sfas no 
requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred as opposed to when there is a commitment to a restructuring plan as set forth under eitf  liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity which has been nullified under sfas no 
as such  we will recognize additional restructuring costs as they are incurred 
income taxes upon adoption of sfas no 
on january   we no longer amortize our fcc license intangible assets 
under previous accounting standards  these assets were being amortized over years 
although the provisions of sfas stipulate that indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized  we are required under fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas  to recognize deferred tax liabilities and assets for temporary differences related to the fcc license intangible assets and the tax deductible portion of these assets 
prior to the adoption of sfas  we considered our deferred tax liabilities related to the fcc license intangible assets as a source of future taxable income in assessing the realization of our deferred tax assets 
because indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are no longer amortized for financial reporting purposes under sfas  the related deferred tax liabilities will not reverse until some indeterminate future period should the fcc license intangible assets become impaired or be disposed of 
therefore  the reversal of deferred tax liabilities related to fcc license intangible assets is no longer considered a source of future taxable income in assessing the realization of deferred tax assets 
as a result of this accounting change  we were required to record an increase in our deferred tax asset valuation allowance totaling approximately million during the first quarter of in addition  we continue to record increases in our valuation allowance based on increases in the deferred tax liabilities and assets for temporary differences related to the fcc license intangible assets 
we structured the disposition of our radio division in and our acquisition of television stations during the period following this disposition in a manner that we believed would qualify these transactions as a like kind exchange under section of the internal revenue code and would permit us to defer recognizing for income tax purposes up to approximately million of gain 
the irs has examined our tax return and has issued us a day letter proposing to disallow all of our gain deferral 
we have filed our protest to this determination with the irs appeals division  but we cannot predict the outcome of this matter at this time  and we may not prevail 
in addition  the day letter offered an alternative position that  in the event the irs is unsuccessful in disallowing all of the gain deferral  approximately million of the million gain deferral will be disallowed 
we have filed a protest to this alternative determination as well 
we may not prevail with respect to this alternative determination 
should the irs successfully challenge our position and disallow all or part of our gain deferral  because we had net operating losses in the years subsequent to in excess of the amount of the deferred gain  we would not be liable for any tax deficiency  but could be liable for interest on the tax liability for the period prior to the carryback of our net operating losses 
we have estimated the amount of interest for which we could be held liable as of december  to be approximately million should the irs succeed in disallowing all of the deferred gain 
if the irs were successful in disallowing only part of the gain under its alternative position  we estimate we would be liable for only a nominal amount of interest 
liquidity and capital resources our primary capital requirements are to fund capital expenditures for our television properties  programming rights payments and debt service payments 
our primary sources of liquidity are our cash on hand and our net working capital 
as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and short term investments and we had working capital of approximately million 
during the year ended december   our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments increased by approximately million due primarily to proceeds from the asset sales described below 
we believe that our cash on hand as well as cash provided by future operations  net working capital and the proceeds from the remaining planned asset sale referred to below will provide the liquidity necessary to meet our obligations and financial commitments through at least the next twelve months 
if we were unable to complete the identified asset sale or our financial results were not as anticipated  we may be required to seek to sell additional assets or raise additional funds through the offering of equity securities in order to generate sufficient cash to meet our liquidity needs 
we can provide no assurance that we would be successful in selling assets or raising additional funds if this were to occur 
cash provided by used in operating activities was approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
these amounts reflect cash generated or used in connection with the operation of pax tv  including the related programming rights and cable distribution rights payments and interest payments on our debt 
the improvement for the year ended december  is due to improved operating results from the modification of our programming schedule and other restructuring activities as well as reduced programming payments in the period 
in addition  our accounts receivable have declined significantly as a result of our increased revenue contribution from long form advertising  which is generally paid in advance 
cash provided by used in investing activities was approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
these amounts include proceeds from the sale of broadcast assets  capital expenditures and short term investment transactions 
during the year ended december   we raised million in proceeds from the sale of broadcast assets in completion of our liquidity plan to raise million 
these asset sales included the sale of our television station kpxf  serving the fresno  california market  to univision communications  inc for million  which we completed in february  the sale of our television stations wmpx  serving the portland auburn  maine market  and wpxo  serving the st 
croix  us virgin islands market for an aggregate purchase price of million  which we completed in april  the sale of our limited partnership interest in television station wwdp  serving the boston  massachusetts market  for approximately million  which we completed in april  and the sale of our television station kapx  serving the albuquerque  new mexico market  for approximately million  which we completed in may we realized aggregate pre tax gains of approximately million on these sales 
in addition  we have signed a definitive agreement to sell the assets of our television station kpxj  serving the shreveport  louisiana market  for million 
the sale of kpxj is expected to close in the first half of the company has an option to purchase the assets of two television stations serving the memphis and new orleans markets for an aggregate purchase price of million of which million was paid for the option to purchase these stations 
the owners of these stations also have the right to require the company to purchase these stations at any time after january  through december  these stations are currently operating under tbas with the company 
cash used in provided by financing activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
these amounts include the proceeds from borrowings to fund capital expenditures and proceeds from stock option exercises  net of principal repayments 
also included are payments of employee withholding taxes on option exercises in connection with the january stock option exchange offer and proceeds from the january and july refinancings described below  as well as the related principal repayments  redemption premiums  preferred stock redemptions and refinancing costs 
capital expenditures  which consist primarily of digital conversion costs and purchases of broadcast equipment for our television stations  were approximately million in  million in and million in the fcc mandated that each licensee of a full power broadcast television station that was allotted a second digital television channel in addition to the current analog channel  complete the construction of digital facilities capable of serving its community of license with a signal of requisite strength by may those digital stations that were not operating by the may date requested extensions of time from the fcc which have been granted with limited exceptions 
despite the current uncertainty that exists in the broadcasting industry with respect to standards for digital broadcast services  planned formats and usage  we have complied and intend to continue to comply with the fcc s timing requirements for the construction of digital television facilities and the broadcast of digital television services 
we have commenced our migration to digital broadcasting in certain of our markets and will continue to do so throughout the required time period 
we currently own or operate stations broadcasting in digital in addition to broadcasting in analog 
with respect to our remaining stations  we have received construction permits from the fcc and will be completing the buildout on twelve stations during  we are awaiting construction permits from the fcc with respect to six of our television stations and six of our television stations have not received a digital channel allocation and therefore will not be converted until the end of the digital transition 
because of the uncertainty as to standards  formats and usage  we cannot currently predict with reasonable certainty the amount or timing of the expenditures we will likely have to make to complete the digital conversion of our stations 
we currently anticipate  however  that we will spend at least an additional million over the next two to three years to complete the conversion 
we will likely fund these expenditures from cash on hand and proceeds from our remaining planned asset sale 
during  we sold our television station wpxb  serving the merrimack  new hampshire market  to nbc for million and realized a pre tax gain of approximately million 
during  we sold our interests in five television stations for aggregate consideration of million and realized pre tax gains of approximately million 
during  we acquired the assets of three television stations for total consideration of million  of which million was paid in prior years  and we paid million to acquire the minority interest in a station acquired in in december  we completed the sale and leaseback of certain of our tower assets for aggregate proceeds of million 
this transaction resulted in a gain of approximately million which has been deferred and is being recognized over the lease term as a reduction of rent expense 
as part of the transaction  we entered into operating leases related to both our analog and digital antennas at these facilities for terms of up to years 
annual rent expense over the lease term is approximately million 
for certain tower assets with a net book value of approximately million as of december   we were unable to transfer title or assign leases to the buyer at closing 
we are in the process of transferring title and assigning leases to the buyer 
in the interim  we entered into management agreements with the buyer on terms consistent with the operating leases 
in january  we completed an offering of senior subordinated discount notes due in gross proceeds of the offering totaled approximately million and were used to refinance our exchange debentures due  which were issued in exchange for the outstanding shares of our exchangeable preferred stock on january   and to pay costs related to the offering 
the notes were sold at a discounted price of of the principal amount at maturity  which represents a yield to maturity of 
interest on the notes will be payable in cash semi annually beginning on july  the senior subordinated discount notes are guaranteed by our subsidiaries 
we recognized a loss due to early extinguishment of debt totaling approximately million in the first quarter of resulting primarily from the redemption premium and the write off of unamortized debt costs associated with the repayment of the exchange debentures 
on july   we completed a million financing consisting of a million senior credit facility and million of senior subordinated notes due proceeds from the initial funding under the senior credit facility and the senior subordinated notes offering were used to repay all of our indebtedness and obligations under our previously existing credit facilities  which were scheduled to mature in june  to redeem our senior subordinated notes and our redeemable preferred stock and to pay redemption premiums  fees and expenses in connection with the refinancing 
the senior subordinated notes are due in and interest on the notes is payable on january and july of each year 
in  we recognized a loss related to early extinguishment of debt totaling approximately million resulting primarily from the write off of unamortized debt costs related to the refinanced indebtedness and the redemption premium and costs associated with the repayment of the senior subordinated notes 
on january   we completed a private offering of million of senior secured floating rate notes 
the senior notes bear interest at the rate of libor plus per year and will mature on january  we may redeem the senior notes at any time at specified redemption prices 
the senior notes are secured by substantially all of our assets 
in addition  a substantial portion of the senior secured notes are unconditionally guaranteed  on a joint and several senior secured basis  by all of our subsidiaries 
the indenture governing the senior secured notes contains certain covenants which  among other things  restrict the incurrence of additional indebtedness  the payment of dividends  transactions with related parties  certain investments and transfers or sales of certain assets 
the proceeds from the offering were used to repay in full the outstanding indebtedness under our senior credit facility described below  pre fund letters of credit supported by the revolving credit portion of the company s previously existing senior credit facility and pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with the transaction 
the million senior credit facility that was refinanced with the proceeds of the january offering consisted of a million revolving credit facility maturing june  a million term a facility maturing december  of which million was outstanding at december  million as of december   and a million term b facility maturing june  of which million was outstanding at december  million as of december  
the revolving credit facility was available for general corporate purposes 
we used the term a portion of the facility to fund the majority of our capital expenditures in the interest rate under the bank facility  as amended  was libor plus or base rate as defined plus at our option 
at december  and  there was million and million  respectively  in borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility and million in outstanding letters of credit as of december  no letters of credit were outstanding at december  in connection with the senior credit facility  we entered into a variable to fixed interest rate swap in the notional amount of million to hedge the impact of interest rate changes on a portion of our variable rate indebtedness 
the interest rate swapped matured on october  and was not renewed 
the fixed rate under the swap was including the spread over libor under our senior credit facility and variable rates were indexed to libor 
the terms of the indentures governing our senior notes and senior subordinated notes contain covenants limiting our ability to incur additional indebtedness except for refinancing indebtedness 
the certificates of designation of two of our outstanding series of preferred stock contain similar covenants 
we structured the disposition of our radio division in and our acquisition of television stations during the period following this disposition in a manner that we believe would qualify these transactions as a like kind exchange under section of the internal revenue code and would permit us to defer recognizing for income tax purposes up to approximately million of gain 
the irs has examined our tax return and has issued to us a day letter proposing to disallow all of our gain deferral 
we have filed our protest to this determination with the irs appeals division  but cannot predict the outcome of this matter at this time  and may not prevail 
in addition  the day letter offered us an alternative position that  in the event the irs is unsuccessful in disallowing all of the gain deferral  approximately million of the million gain deferral will be disallowed 
we filed a protest to this alternative determination as well 
we may not prevail with respect to this alternative determination 
should the irs successfully challenge our position and disallow all or part of our gain deferral  because we had net operating losses in the years subsequent to in excess of the amount of the deferred gain  we would not be liable for any tax deficiency  but could be liable for interest on the tax liability for the period prior to the carryback of our net operating losses 
we have estimated the amount of interest for which we could be held liable to be approximately million should the irs succeed in disallowing all of the deferred gain 
if the irs were successful in disallowing only part of the gain under its alternative position  we estimate we would be liable for only a nominal amount of interest 
contractual obligations and commitments as of december   we were obligated under the terms of our credit agreement  indentures  programming contracts  cable distribution agreements and operating lease agreements and employment contracts as of december  to make future payments as follows in thousands thereafter total senior subordinated notes and bank financing    obligations for program rights and program rights commitments     obligations to cbs     cable agreements   operating leases and employment contracts        after considering the terms of the january refinancing of the senior credit facility

as of december   obligations for programming rights and program rights commitments require collective payments by the company of approximately million as follows in thousands obligations for program program rights rights commitments total on august   we entered into agreements with a subsidiary of cbs broadcasting  inc cbs and crown media united states  llc crown media to sublicense our rights to broadcast the television series touched by an angel touched to crown media for exclusive exhibition on the hallmark channel  commencing september  under the terms of the agreement with crown media  we are to receive approximately million from crown media  million of which will be paid over a three year period that commenced in august and the remaining million  for the season  is to be paid over a three year period that commenced in august in addition  the agreement with crown media provides that crown media is obligated to sublicense from the company future seasons of touched should cbs renew the series 
as further described below  cbs did not renew touched for the season 
under the terms of our agreement with cbs  we remain obligated to cbs for amounts due under our pre existing license agreement  less estimated programming cost savings of approximately million 
as of december   amounts due or committed to cbs totaled approximately million 
the transaction resulted in a gain of approximately million  which is being deferred over the term of the crown media agreement 
we have a significant concentration of credit risk with respect to the amounts due from crown media under the sublicense agreement 
as of december   the maximum amount of loss due to credit risk that we would sustain if crown media failed to perform under the agreement totaled approximately million  representing the present value of amounts due from crown media 
under the terms of the sublicense agreement  we have the right to terminate crown media s rights to broadcast touched if crown media fails to make timely payments under the agreement 
therefore  should crown media fail to perform under the agreement  we could regain our exclusive rights to broadcast touched on pax tv pursuant to our existing licensing agreement with cbs 
under our agreement with cbs  we were required to license future seasons of touched from cbs upon the series being renewed by cbs 
under our sublicense agreement with crown media  crown media was obligated to sublicense such future seasons from us 
our financial obligation to cbs for future seasons exceeded the sublicense fees to be received from crown media  resulting in accrued programming losses to the extent the series was renewed in future seasons 
during the second quarter of  upon the decision by cbs to renew touched for the season  we became obligated to license the season  resulting in an accrued programming loss of approximately million 
this amount was offset in part by a decrease in our estimated loss on the season of approximately million  resulting in a net accrued programming loss of million 
the change in estimate for the season was due to the sublicensing agreement with crown media and a lower number of episodes produced than previously estimated 
in  cbs determined that it would not renew touched for the season 
our obligations to cbs for touched will be partially funded through the sub license fees from crown media 
as of december   our obligation to cbs and our receivable from crown media related to touched are as follows in thousands obligations to amounts due from cbs crown media net amount amount representing interest   as of december   obligations for cable distribution rights require collective payments by us of approximately million in and million in new accounting pronouncements effective january   we adopted sfas no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the tables below provide information about our market sensitive financial instruments and constitute forward looking statements 
all items described are non trading 
our primary market risk exposure is changing interest rates 
we manage interest rate risks through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt 
we use interest rate swaps to adjust interest rate exposures when appropriate  based upon market conditions 
expected maturity dates for variable rate debt and interest rate swaps in the tables below are based upon contractual maturity dates  after giving effect to the january refinancing of the senior credit facility 
average interest rates on variable rate debt and average variable rates under interest rate swaps are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at the reporting date 
fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time  based on relevant market information about the financial instrument 
these estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment 
the fair value of variable rate debt approximates the carrying value since interest rates are variable and thus approximate current market rates 
the fair value of interest rate swaps is determined from dealer quotations and represents the discounted future cash flows through maturity or expiration using current rates 
the fair value is effectively the amount we would pay or receive to terminate the agreements 
at december  we had million of floating rate indebtedness outstanding under our senior credit facility  excluding letters of credit  which are not subject to interest rate risk 
as discussed in further detail in item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition liquidity and capital resources  we refinanced the senior credit facility with the proceeds of our january offering of million senior secured floating rates notes
