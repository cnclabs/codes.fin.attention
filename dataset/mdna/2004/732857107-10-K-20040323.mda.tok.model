item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations note certain information in this report constitutes forward looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws 
forward looking information  which includes forecasted asset purchases and sales and forecasted sources and uses of cash is subject to risks  trends  and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected 
those uncertainties include but are not limited to changes to regulations that affect the partnership s ability to harvest timber and develop real estate  economic conditions  which can have a significant effect on the price the partnership can obtain for its timber  real estate  and other investments  and each of those items discussed in risk and uncertainties  below 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the partnership s audited consolidated financial statements included with this report 
executive overview pope resources  a delaware limited partnership we or the partnership  was organized in october as a result of a spin off by pope talbot  inc p t 
pope resources is engaged in three primary businesses 
the first  and by far most significant segment in terms of owned assets and operations  is the fee timber segment 
operations in this segment consist of growing timber to be harvested as logs for sale to export and domestic manufacturers 
the second most significant business in terms of total assets owned is the development and sale of real estate 
real estate activities primarily take the form of securing permits and entitlements for raw land and then realizing that land s value by the selling of larger parcels to buyers who will take the land further up the value chain either to home buyers or commercial property end users 
since these land projects span multiple years  the real estate segment may incur losses for multiple years until a major project is sold resulting in operating income 
our third business is that of providing timberland related services to third parties 
these services may take the form of large scale timberland management  forestry consulting  or acquisition or disposition services 
factors affecting results from each of these segments are discussed in more detail below 
as of december   we owned nearly  acres of timberland in western washington state plus  acres of real estate held for development 
in january the partnership acquired an additional  acres of timberland in its current operating area 
our third party services have been historically conducted in the states of washington  oregon  and california  plus the canadian provinces of british columbia and alberta 
macroeconomic factors that have a significant bearing on our business include the following housing starts in the us and to a lesser degree in japan  interest rates  and currency exchange rates particularly those between the us and canada  japan  and europe 
the first two of these macroeconomic factors reflect or influence the health of the us housing market 
the housing market  together with the repair and remodel market  consume nearly of the log volume supplied to the us currency exchange rates influence the competitiveness of our primary product compared to logs that might be imported from canada  europe  or the southern hemisphere 
a favorable us yen exchange rate can help our export logs compete in the japanese market with logs that originate from canada  europe  or the southern hemisphere 
as an owner and manager of timberland  we focus keenly on three product markets the markets for logs  lumber and timberland 
each of these markets has unique and distinct market factors so that they do not move up or down in lockstep with each other 
generally  the lumber market is the most volatile as it responds quickly even daily to changing demand expectations that are housing driven and changes to lumber inventories 
log markets will in turn be affected by what is happening in the lumber spot markets  but pricing shifts typically adjust monthly rather than daily 
log price volatility is also moderated because logs are used to produce products besides just lumber especially pulp 
the market for timberland tends to be even less volatile with pricing that lags both lumber and log markets 
this is a function of the longer time horizons utilized by investors in timberland where the short swing fluctuations of log or lumber prices become stabilized in acquisition modeling 
we watch the lumber market because activity there can presage log price changes 
we are in the log market constantly as we negotiate delivery prices to our customers 
the timberland market is important as we are constantly evaluating our own portfolio and its underlying value as well as the opportunities to adjust that portfolio through either the acquisition or disposition of such land 
management s major opportunity and challenge is to profitably grow our revenue base 
we have added almost  acres over the last three years to our timberland portfolio with the most recent addition of  acres coming in january our real estate challenges center around how and when to harvest a parcel of land and capture the optimum value increment through sale 
regarding our third party timberland services  we are without a major client contract in early for the first time in six years and are intently seeking to secure income opportunities for this segment 
our consolidated revenues in   and  on a percentage basis by segment  are as follows segment fee timber timberland management and consulting real estate further segment financial information is presented in note to the partnership s consolidated financial statements included with this report

fee timber revenues and operating income fee timber revenue is earned primarily from the harvest and sale of logs from the partnership s  acres of fee timber located in western washington and to a lesser extent from the sale of gravel and cellular communication tower leases 
in january we acquired an additional  acres of timberland  which increased our timberland holdings to  acres 
revenue and operating income generated by the fee timber segment for each year in the three year period ended december   are as follows year ended timber revenue mineral  cell tower  and other revenue total fee timber revenue operating income december  million million million million december  million million million million december  million million million million fiscal year compared to fee timber revenue decreased  or  to million in from million in harvest volume declined slightly to million board feet mmbf from mmbf for the decline in harvest volume combined with a per mbf decline in average price realized resulted in the decline in revenue  which was partially offset by an increase in revenue from small timberland sales that represented  of revenue in and  of revenue in operating income decreased  or  to million from million in the decrease in operating income is due to the decline in revenue and an increase in road maintenance and silviculture costs 
the partnership regularly adjusts its timberland portfolio of holdings as part of its active management through acquisitions and dispositions of smaller parcels 
the timberland acquisition in january of of  acres for million is a good example of this type of transaction 
a large component of this specific acquisition represented merchantable timber 
as a result  annual harvest levels in and are expected to increase to approximately mmbf and are forecasted to fall back to the level of mmbf in fiscal year compared to fee timber revenue decreased million  or  to million in from million in in  we harvested million board feet mmbf up mmbf  or  from the harvest volume of mmbf 
in spite of this harvest volume difference  annual revenues for are lower than the prior year s revenues due to the sale of  acres of land and timber for million in our weighted average log price of per thousand board feet mbf for the year ending was down mbf  or  from the year ending operating income increased million  or  to million in from million in  largely due to the increase in harvest volume 
export log market 
log revenues from our timberland ownership are significantly affected by export log market conditions 
sales to the export market totaled   and of log revenue for   and  respectively 
the vast majority of our export log volume is sold to japan 
indirect sales to the export market totaled mmbf  mmbf  and mmbf  of softwood logs for   and  respectively 
the decrease in volume sold through the export market in is indicative of deteriorating export market conditions  a trend that also existed from to the average price per mbf realized for export logs sold was   and for   and  respectively 
the realized average export log price did not change from to but declined from to low export prices realized in and were driven largely by weak economic conditions in japan  the growth of engineered wood products  and increased foreign competition in the log market 
the export log market is experiencing some improvement in export pricing in the first quarter of  but management does not project a significant  sustained improvement in the export market in the foreseeable future 
domestic log market 
domestic sawlog volumes were mmbf  mmbf  and mmbf in   and  respectively 
the increase in domestic volume sold in from represents a shift in volume from the export market to the domestic market 
average realized domestic log prices per mbf were   and in   and  respectively 
prices realized from domestic log sales declined due to two separate factors 
first  lumber imports from canada have increased as a result of the softwood lumber dispute between the us and canada 
as a result  log prices have declined as domestic mills are competing with imported canadian lumber 
second  the domestic log market remains saturated with logs that were redirected away from weak asian export markets 
management expects to continue pursuing heavier sales volumes in domestic markets so long as overseas log markets remain relatively weak 
other timber products 
pulp  hardwood  and other log volumes represented   and of total harvest volume for   and  respectively 
the slight increase in other timber volume sold as a percent of total volume in relative to is due to the harvesting of more lower quality hemlock stands on the hood canal tree farm  which produced a higher proportion of pulp logs 
the significant decline in pulp  hardwood and other volume as a percent of total harvest in relative to is due to improved log merchandising 
logs sold as pulp generally command lower prices than logs sold as sawlogs in the domestic market 
to the extent log volume can be moved from pulp logs to domestic sawlog sorts  higher revenue is realized 
other log prices were   and  per mbf for   and  respectively 
the increase in price realized on other timber products represents an improvement in price realized on pulp logs in relative to the increase in pulp prices was caused by a decline in local pulp log inventories 
the decline in other log prices in relative to reflects the overall decline in log prices during that period 
harvest volumes and seasonality 
we harvested the following timber for each year in the three year period ended december  year softwood sawlogs pulp  hardwood  and other totals volume mmbf price mbf volume mmbf price mbf volume mmbf price mbf the partnership s  acres of timberland consist of the  acre hood canal tree farm and the  acre columbia tree farm  which includes the  acres acquired in january the hood canal tree farm is located in the hood canal region of washington state 
most of this tree farm acreage is at a relatively low elevation where harvest activities are possible year round 
as a result of this competitive advantage  we are often able to harvest and sell a greater portion of our annual harvest in the first half of the year when the log supply in the marketplace tends to be lower 
during management decided to front load harvest toward the beginning of the year to take advantage of what appeared to be a short term spike in the log markets 
harvest activities in were relatively consistent from quarter to quarter while  during  harvest activities tapered off in early autumn as we reached our planned annual harvest volume 
the percentage of annual harvest volume harvested by quarter for each year in the three year period ended december  is as follows year ended q q q q december  december  december  cost of sales fee timber cost of sales for each year in the three year period ended december   are as follows year ended depletion harvest  haul and other land sale costs total december  million million million million december  million million million million december  million million million million depletion costs from harvest activities averaged   and per mbf for   and  respectively 
the depletion rate changes each year as harvested timber stands are removed  or depleted  and new depletion layers are added to the overall depletion pool as merchantable timber stands reach the age of the depletion rate in declined from the rate in  reflecting the interplay between removing harvested timber stands and adding new depletion layers 
blending the higher relative cost basis of the timber on the columbia tree farm acquired in with hood canal tree farm s low historical basis caused the depletion rate per mbf to increase significantly from to depletion costs in also include million in depletion resulting from timberland sales  most notably stemming from the  acre sale of a portion of the columbia tree farm 
the depletion rate in represents one full year of harvest from the higher cost basis columbia tree farm 
management expects an increase in the depletion rate in as we closed on an million timberland acquisition early in harvest  haul and other costs excluding costs resulting from timberland sales averaged   and per mbf for   and  respectively 
average harvest haul and other costs increased modestly from to and decreased from to harvest costs vary based upon the physical site characteristics of acreage harvested 
harvest units that are difficult to access  or that are located on steep hillsides  are more expensive to harvest 
haul costs vary based upon the distance between the harvest site and the customer s location 
costs resulting from timberland sales were   and million in   and  respectively 
the timberland sale costs in resulted from the aforementioned  acre sale of a portion of the columbia tree farm 
operating expenses fee timber operating expenses for each of the three years ended december    and were million  million  and million  respectively 
operating cost increased in relative to due to added silviculture and road maintenance costs 
silviculture costs represent the cost of projects that are undertaken for the purpose of increasing the quantity or quality of our timber inventory 
examples include management of competing vegetation and work performed to improve the seed stock available for us to grow seedlings for future reforestation 
we have experienced an increase in road maintenance costs following the enactment of new road maintenance rules in washington state 
management expects continued high levels of road maintenance costs for the next to years as we upgrade roads and culverts to comply with the new rules 
the increase in operating expenses in relative to is due to the first full year of operating costs for the columbia tree farm that was acquired in march of timberland management and consulting revenues and operating income the timberland management and consulting segment earns revenue by providing timberland management and forestry consulting services to timberland owners and managers 
an additional aspect of that segment s activities is the development of timberland property portfolios on behalf of third party clients 
management is currently marketing a timber fund to individual and institutional investors interested in investing directly in timberland properties to diversify their portfolios 
results for reflect the decline in revenue following htrg s decision to integrate management of its client properties into operations with the corollary decision not to renew the timberland management contract with ormllc 
revenues and operating income for the timberland management and consulting segment for each year in the three year period ended december   are as follows year ended revenues operating income december  million million december  million million december  million million net of  of restructuring charges fiscal year compared to revenue decreased million  or  to million in from million in the decrease in revenue was primarily the result of htrg s decision to not renew the management contract with ormllc and the closure of our canadian forestry consulting offices 
operating income declined  or 
revenue and operating income in includes million and million of revenue  respectively  from a major timberland management client 
ormllc successfully completed the management assignment for this client in late as a result  operating results for are expected to compare unfavorably to for this segment unless additional management or consulting assignments are located to replace the revenue from the completed project 
fiscal year compared to revenue decreased million  or  to million in from million in the decrease in revenue resulted from the renegotiation of a timberland management contract in mid the contract change resulted in a lower management fee offset in part by a larger fee earned upon disposition of the properties managed 
operating income declined  or 
the decrease in operating income is primarily due to  of restructuring charges recorded in the fourth quarter of following htrg s decision to not renew the management contract with ormllc and the closure of our canadian forestry consulting offices 
operating expenses timberland management and consulting operating expenses for each of the three years ended december    and were million  million  and million  respectively 
operating expenses decreased million  or  in relative to as a result of reducing the support infrastructure supporting the htrg contract and closure of the forestry consulting offices in canada 
operating expenses decreased in relative to as a result of reduced operating expenses in the forestry consulting business in canada offset by the  of restructuring charges recorded following the loss of the htrg contract and closure of the forestry consulting offices in canada 
investor portfolio management business ipmb ipmb operations include timberland management and portfolio development 
an example of portfolio development is orm timber fund i  lp 
if and when the fund is fully subscribed  both management and acquisition fees will be earned from administering the fund 
these activities are  as well as the marketing costs associated with the fund  part of the ipmb 
ipmb operations are currently conducted in ormllc and are subject to the following terms in the fund s limited partnership agreement 
limitation on expenditures the amendment to pope resources limited partnership agreement authorizing the ipmb strategy limits our cumulative net expenditures to  including debt guarantees 
as of december  cumulative expenditures incurred in pursuit of ipmb opportunities  including guarantees  were less than cumulative revenues generated 
therefore  cumulative net expenditures as of december  against the  limit are zero 
allocation of income the amendment to pope resources limited partnership agreement further specifies that income from the ipmb will be split using a sliding scale allocation method beginning at to the partnership s wholly owned subsidiary  orm  inc  and to pope mgp  inc  the managing general partner of the partnership 
the sliding scale allocation method will evenly divide ipmb income between orm  inc and pope mgp  inc 
once such income reaches  in any given fiscal year 
real estate revenues and operating income real estate segment revenues are derived from land sales and rental income from income producing properties 
results from real estate operations are expected to vary significantly from year to year as we make multi year investments in entitlements and infrastructure prior to selling entitled or developed land 
an example of this is our development property at gig harbor  washington 
in  the city of gig harbor approved an amendment to its comprehensive plan that allows acres of our property to be upzoned from business park to commercial zoning 
following this amendment  work began immediately to submit a rezone application and to plan the infrastructure necessary to make development of this site possible 
in december we signed a purchase and sale agreement with costco wholesale corporation to sell up to acres of this acre site for a store expected to open in our agreement with costco specifies a price to be paid of per square foot  with the amount of square footage ultimately dependent on final site layout and store design considerations 
we expect the ultimate sale price paid to be approximately million for approximately acres 
this sale is not expected to close until late or as closing is contingent upon completion of the rezone application and installation of certain key infrastructure components 
revenues and operating loss for the real estate segment for each year in the three year period ended december   are as follows year ended revenues operating loss operating loss excluding nonrecurring expenses december  million million million december  million million million december  million million million includes  of environmental remediation charges related to port gamble and  of warranty charges related to port ludlow 
includes million in asset impairment charges related to the sale of port ludlow 
fiscal year compared to revenue increased  or  to million from million in the increase in revenue is due to an increase in revenue generated at the port gamble townsite offset by a decrease in revenue from land sales 
the port gamble townsite has benefited from increased management attention following the sale of port ludlow in management has identified several buildings that were not being utilized to their full potential and  after making some capital improvements  has leased the properties at higher rates than previously realized 
land sale revenue has declined following the sale of all the lots in the seabeck and grandridge plats 
fiscal year compared to revenue generated by the real estate segment decreased million due to the sale of port ludlow operations in august operating loss decreased million primarily due to fewer non recurring charges in  in and million in and the sale of port ludlow in cost of sales real estate cost of sales for each of the three years ended december    and were  million  and million  respectively 
the decrease in cost of sales in relative to is due to the decrease in land sales 
the decrease in costs of sales in relative to was due to the sale of port ludlow in the earlier period 
operating costs real estate operating expenses for each of the three years ended december    and were million  million  and million  respectively 
the decrease in operating expense from to is due to  of non recurring expenses  of environmental remediation and  of warranty charges in netted against an increase in operating expenses for the gig harbor property 
the decrease in operating expenses in relative to is due to the sale of port ludlow in offset by the  of non recurring charges in environmental remediation costs we have an accrued liability of  and  at december  and  respectively 
the accrual represents estimated environmental remediation charges in and around the townsite of port gamble 
port gamble is a historic town that was owned by pope talbot  inc p t for decades until when the townsite and other assets were spun off to the partnership 
p t continued to operate the townsite through and lease the mill site at port gamble until january when a settlement agreement was signed between the partnership and p t  which divided up the responsibility for paying environmental remediation charges in port gamble 
the mill site had an operating lumber mill through that was dismantled by the end of activity in the environmental remediation liability consists of the following balances at the beginning of the period additions to accrual expenditures for remediation balances at the end of the period year ended december    year ended december     year ended december     as of december  the majority of the clean up work was complete 
most of the expenditures now represent the cost of monitoring the sites  which is required for five years 
the remaining liability as of december  is expected to be adequate to cover remaining costs  however  if monitoring activities discover additional contamination  costs could exceed management s current estimate 
general and administrative g a fiscal year compared to g a costs decreased million  or  to million from million in the decrease is due to reductions in administrative headcount following the loss of the htrg contract in december of g a costs represented of revenue for the year ended december  as compared to of revenue for the comparable period in fiscal year compared to g a costs decreased million  or  to million in from million in the decrease is due to continued efforts to realize cost savings from our administrative departments following the sale of operations at port ludlow offset by  of restructuring charges incurred in following the loss of the htrg contract 
g a costs represented of revenue for the year ended december  as compared to for the comparable period in taxes fiscal year compared to income tax expense represents the tax expense associated with the partnership s taxable subsidiaries where third party fee for service business is conducted 
tax expense in was  compared with a tax benefit of  in the income tax benefit in is the result of reducing the valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset relating to the realization of net operating losses from a subsidiary in canada that was liquidated in the fourth quarter of fiscal year compared to an income tax benefit of  was recorded in compared to an expense of million in the income tax benefit in resulted from the aforementioned realization of a tax benefit resulting from the canadian subsidiary 
tax expense in resulted from income generated from the third party fee for service business 
minority interest minority interest represents pope mgp  inc s share of earnings from the partnership s ipmb 
a description of ipmb can be found in the preceding discussion of operating results for the timberland management and consulting segment 
fiscal year compared to the minority interest charge decreased  in to  from  in the decline in minority interest is due to the loss of the htrg contract in december minority interest in was generated through commissions earned on the disposition of timberland properties for a timberland management customer 
fiscal year compared to the minority interest charge decreased  to  in from  in the decrease in minority interest is due to the reduction in operating income from our timberland management activities following htrg s decision not to renew its management contract with ormllc

liquidity and capital resources cash flows general 
the partnership s cash position has been building since when we used a combination of timber mortgage debt and proceeds from the sale of port ludlow to acquire the columbia tree farm 
as of december  our cash position was million  representing a million increase from the december  balance of million 
in january we used million of this cash balance to acquire  acres of timberland that is interspersed among the columbia tree farm a  earnest money deposit had been paid into escrow prior to year end 
as a result of this acquisition  our timber harvest is expected to increase to mmbf in both and from mmbf in and  which will result in an increase in both net income and operating cash flows 
we generate operating cash flow through the sale of timber products  by providing timberland management and consulting services  and by selling land for development 
an additional recurring source of cash is payments received on a note receivable from the purchaser of the port ludlow assets  which were sold in this note  secured by homes and lots in port ludlow  has a balance of  at december   and matures in august significant recurring uses of cash include the following replanting and fertilizing trees  maintaining an adequate road system on our tree farms  investing in our development properties  funding annual debt payments on timber mortgages and local improvement district debt  and funding quarterly cash distributions 
as a general rule  management expects operating cash flows will be sufficient to cover the foregoing and to build up cash reserves 
as discussed below  however  we may incur additional debt in the future to fund timberland purchases or significant capital improvements on our development properties if management determines operating cash flows or cash reserves are not sufficient to cover these expenditures 
management decided to not renew its line of credit in as the cash balance and short term capital needs made the line of credit unnecessary 
while credit markets are currently very favorable for the partnership  management can make no assurance that if we need to obtain capital through borrowing in the future that financing will be available on terms acceptable to management 
operating cash flows 
the table below provides the components of operating cash flows for each of the three years   and cash received from customers and paid to suppliers and employees results from the harvest and sale of forest products from our tree farms  timberland management and consulting services provided to timberland owners  and finally  the sale and management of our development properties 
operating cash flow cash received from customers    cash paid to suppliers and employees   interest received interest paid  net of amounts capitalized   income taxes paid cash provided by operations    cash provided by operations decreased  or to million in from million in the decrease in cash provided by operations is due primarily to the loss of the htrg management contract in december in addition to the loss of cash generated from this contract we made restructuring payments of  during to restructure operations following the loss of this portion of our operations 
offsetting these decreases in operating cash flow was a million decrease in cash paid for the environmental remediation at port gamble and an increase in cash generated from the fee timber segment as a result of the timing of harvest activities at the end of and during cash provided by operations decreased million or to million from million in the decrease in operating cash flow was primarily due to the sale of port ludlow in and an increase in environmental remediation expenditures of million 
cash used in investing activities 
the table below represents the components of cash used in investing activities for the three years   and investing activities consist primarily of tree planting  road building and silviculture activities on our tree farms and investment in our development properties to acquire the entitlements necessary to make further development of the properties possible 
investing activities buildings and equipment development properties timber and roads   acquisition of columbia tree farm  proceeds from the sale of fixed assets proceeds from the sale of port ludlow  cash used in investing activities    cash used in investing activities increased  or  to million due to an increase in investments in development properties  a decrease in proceeds from the sale of fixed assets netted against a decrease in permanent road construction temporary roads and road repair are expensed as incurred 
the increase in development property capital expenditures has been driven by an increase in activities on our development property at gig harbor 
in  we sold an office building acquired with the columbia tree farm that resulted in greater proceeds from sales of fixed assets when compared to cash used in investing activities decreased million to million in from million in this decrease is due to the acquisition of the columbia tree farm in  netted against proceeds from the sale of port ludlow 
following the sale of port ludlow  capital expenditures for buildings and equipment decreased 
port ludlow s various commercial properties required large recurring capital expenditures 
cash used in financing activities 
the table below represents the components of cash used in financing activities for the three years   and our financing activities primarily result from payments made on the timber mortgages  unitholder distributions  and distributions to the managing general partner  pope mgp for its minority interest in the ipmb 
financing activities mortgage proceeds  mortgage lid payments    cash distribution to unitholders  cash used to repurchase units minority interest distribution cash used provided by financing activities   cash used in financing activities increased million  or  to million in half this increase is due to an increase in required principal payments on our timber mortgages from million in to million in the increase in required annual principal payments under the mortgages was negotiated at the time of the acquisition of the columbia tree farm in the other half of the increase is due to an increase in cash used for distributions  which increased from two quarterly distributions totaling per unit in to four quarterly distributions totaling per unit in cash provided by financing activities decreased from million in to cash used in financing activities of million in the primary reason for this fluctuation is mortgage debt of million incurred in connection with the acquisition of the columbia tree farm  netted against million in mortgage prepayments in late following the sale of a subset of the newly acquired columbia tree farm 
the additional mortgage principal payment was allowed under the mortgage agreement without incurring a prepayment premium 
the partnership has already taken advantage of all unscheduled mortgage paydowns allowed without triggering a prepayment premium under the mortgage agreement 
expected future changes to cash flows operating cash flows 
as discussed above  we plan to increase the partnership s annual harvest volume from mmbf in to mmbf in and the increase is due to the january acquisition of  acres of timberland with a large component of merchantable timber 
the increased harvest level is expected to translate into an increase in cash flow from operations in both and investing activities 
as noted above  we incurred timberland acquisition cost of million in january to purchase additional acreage 
additional investing activities in and include a planned million co investment in orm timber fund i  lp the fund 
the fund is currently being marketed to institutional investors and high net worth individuals as a vehicle for investment in timberlands 
the partnership has agreed to invest up to of the total amount of equity capital raised by the fund  targeted at million 
this investment will not be made until the fund is fully subscribed and timberland acquisitions have been identified 
in addition to the fund  expenditures on our project at gig harbor are expected to increase over the next few years 
financing activities 
when the fund is fully subscribed we may need to raise additional capital to make our co investment in the fund 
additionally  management is always looking for opportunities to add to our timberland portfolio where expected returns meet management s expectations 
the capital required for gig harbor is expected to result in only a short term capital infusion to bridge the time between making infrastructure investments and closing land sales such as for costco wholesale corporation 
management anticipates using short term bank debt to bridge this capital need 
however  we currently have no credit arrangements in place 
management is currently evaluating options for financing the projects discussed under investing activities 
as indicated above  current plans are to fund these projects from a combination of operating cash flow and short term debt 
in considering the options for funding cash requirements  management has weighed the alternatives of issuing new partnership units vs 
incurring debt 
management s view is that the prevailing trading price of the partnership s units at this time makes the issuance of additional units a sub optimal currency with which to fund growth 
our debt to total capitalization ratio as of december   as measured by the book and market value of our equity  was and  respectively 
should a financing need arise  management is comfortable that there is room to take on some debt with the ratio at these levels  since our loan covenant which limits debt to total capitalization to is measured against the lower of these two calculations 
the hood canal tree farm secures the partnership s current timberland mortgage while the columbia tree farm is not currently used as collateral on any debt obligations 
the partnership s strong financial position and historically low interest rates makes borrowing relatively inexpensive and easy to obtain 
risks and uncertainties a number of known risks  some of which are discussed below  as well as various unknown risks and uncertainties  may cause our revenues to fall short of management s expectations 
although certain statements in this report are forward looking in nature  these known and unknown risks make it impossible for management to predict with any degree of certainty either quantitative factors such as cash flow  results of operations or financial condition  or qualitative factors such as management s plans  objectives  or responses to various events or occurrences 
readers therefore should recognize that statements other than those of historical fact are not guarantees or assurances of future performance  but are forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
some of our forward looking statements can be identified by the use of predictive terms such as expect  anticipate  will  might  may  plans and words of similar meaning or construction 
the following section discusses some of the known risks that may cause our actual financial results to fall materially short of management s expectations  or that may cause management to deviate from its expressed intentions or predictions 
readers should also recognize that this list is not exhaustive  and in addition to those factors listed below  a wide range of risks faced by most or all participants in the timber industry or in international trade  as well as various unexpected events or conditions  may adversely impact our business 
competition generally we compete against much larger companies in each of its business segments 
we compete with these companies for management and line personnel  as well as for purchases of relatively scarce capital assets such as land and standing timber and for sales of our products 
these larger competitors may have access to larger amounts of capital and significantly greater economies of scale  and they may be better able to absorb the risks of our line of business 
moreover  the timber industry has experienced significant consolidation in recent years  and as that consolidation occurs  our relative market share decreases and the relative financial capacity of our competitors increases 
while management believes the partnership is at a competitive advantage over some of these companies because of our lack of vertical integration into forest products manufacturing  our advantageous tax structure  and management s attempts to diversify our asset base  we cannot assure readers that competition will not have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations or our financial condition 
fee timber competition and demand issues fee timber revenue is generated primarily through the sale of softwood logs to the domestic and export markets located in western washington 
the market for these products is significantly affected by fluctuations in us and japanese economies and in relative currency exchange rates 
the market for our timber products is generally negatively affected by the rise in the use of engineered wood products that substitute for solid sawn products 
the rise in the use of engineered wood products results in less of a premium for larger diameter douglas fir logs 
many of the engineered wood products are made from lower quality logs  which over time has eroded log prices and created more of a commoditization of wood fiber 
while timber sold has realized lower prices with the rise in engineered wood products  wood fiber is expected to remain an important commodity that management expects will continue to be used extensively for building 
the proximity of lumber mills to the timberland supplying these mills is important to our profitability 
western washington has experienced a trend towards consolidation of lumber mills to fewer  larger volume manufacturers 
local demand for our products has remained strong through the trend towards consolidation of lumber mills in western washington 
if in the future that consolidation leads to less local competition for wood fiber  our profitability could be negatively impacted 
canadian lumber imports have increased over the last few years as a result  in part  of the protracted trade dispute between the us and canada  in which the us imposed duties on canadian lumber imports 
because these duties were based upon the average cost per mbf to produce lumber in canada  they had the inadvertent effect of increasing canadian production as producers worked to lower their per unit costs and thus lower their export duties  as measured on a per mbf basis 
this resulted in an increase of canadian lumber imports  which has had a negative impact on domestic lumber prices 
lower domestic lumber prices tend to decrease the price of logs sold domestically 
the impact to log prices of any eventual settlement to the trade dispute between the us and canada is difficult to predict 
our ability to grow and harvest timber can be significantly impacted by legislation to restrict or stop forest practices 
restrictions to logging  planting  road building  fertilizing  managing competing vegetation  and other activities can significantly increase the cost or reduce available inventory thereby reducing future income 
timberland management and consulting over of timberland management and consulting revenue in was generated through one client 
the project that we were working on in for this client was largely completed as of december  with the disposition of the last of their properties 
as a result management does not expect operations to include significant revenue from this client 
we are working to expand our customer base through market outreach efforts to create additional management and consulting opportunities for prospective clients that are looking to lower costs and improve efficiencies 
however  we cannot assure readers that these plans will prove viable or that management will successfully implement those plans 
real estate the value of our real estate investments is subject to changes in the economic and regulatory environment 
our real estate investments are long term in nature  which raises the risk of unforeseen changes in the economy or laws surrounding development activities having an adverse affect on our investments 
tax status the partnership is a master limited partnership mlp and is therefore not subject to income taxes 
if that changed due to a change in tax law or interpretation of current tax law such that the partnership became subject to income taxes  operating results would be adversely affected 
securities and exchange commission sec regulation as a publicly traded partnership the company is subject to the laws and regulations affecting all publicly held entities 
the cost of compliance with these laws and regulations has increased over the last few years as rule making  enforcement actions  and lawsuits have become more prevalent 
our strategy for dealing with these changes is to continue to make our periodic reporting to investors and the sec accurate  informative and in compliance with applicable securities laws 
contractual obligations  commercial commitments and contingencies our commitments at december  consist of performance bonds  operating leases  and purchase obligations entered into in the normal course of business 
payments due by period commitment expiration period obligation or commitment total less than year years years after years total debt     performance bonds   operating leases     unconditional purchase obligations    other long term obligations    total contractual obligations    we have debt totaling million with the contractual maturities described in note of partnership s consolidated financial statements included with this report 
the partnership has committed to invest of equity capital in orm timber fund i  lp once a timberland acquisition is closed by the fund 
targeted equity capital for this fund is million and at that level the partnership s commitment would be million 
other long term obligations include the partnership s  contingent liability as of december  for environmental remediation in and around the port gamble townsite and  liability for a supplemental employment retirement plan 
we expect to spend  of these liabilities in and  thereafter 
the partnership may from time to time be a defendant in lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of business 
management believes that loss to the partnership  if any  will not have a material adverse effect to the partnership s consolidated financial condition or results of operations 
off balance sheet arrangements the partnership is not a party to off balance sheet arrangements and does not hold variable interests in unconsolidated entities 
capital expenditures and commitments we acquired  acres of timberland that is interspersed with the columbia tree farm in january using million of cash 
additional capital expenditures in are currently expected to be approximately million 
however  these expenditures could be increased or decreased as a consequence of future economic conditions 
the majority of the increase in capital expenditures in over both and represents costs expected to be incurred at our development property at gig harbor  washington 
we expect that the funds for these expenditures will primarily be generated internally through operations but may require some short term external financing 
government regulation compliance with laws  regulations  and demands usually involves capital expenditures as well as operating costs 
we cannot easily quantify future amounts of capital expenditures required to comply with laws  regulations  and demands  or the effects on operating costs  because in some instances compliance standards have not been developed or have not become final or definitive 
accordingly  at this time we have not included herein a quantification of future capital requirements to comply with any new regulations being developed by the united states or canadian regulatory agencies 
additionally  many federal and state environmental regulations  as well as local zoning and land use ordinances  place limits upon various aspects of our operations 
these limits include restrictions on our harvest methods and volumes  remediation requirements that may increase our post harvest reclamation costs  esa limitations on our ability to harvest in certain areas  zoning and development restrictions that impact our real estate segment  and a wide range of other existing and pending statutes and regulations 
various initiatives are presented from time to time that seek further restrictions on timber and real estate development businesses  and although management currently is not aware of any material noncompliance with applicable law  we cannot assure readers that we ultimately will be successful in complying with all such regulations or that additional regulations will not ultimately have a material adverse impact upon our business 
accounting matters accounting standards implemented in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
this interpretation addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities vie s 
a vie is subject to the consolidation provisions of fin no 
if it cannot support its financial activities without additional subordinated financial support from third parties or its equity investors lack any one of the following characteristics the ability to make decisions about its activities through voting rights  the obligation to absorb losses of the entity if they occur  or the right to receive residual returns of the entity if they occur 
fin no 
requires a vie to be consolidated by its primary beneficiary 
the primary beneficiary is the party that holds the variable interests that expose it to a majority of the entity s expected losses and or residual returns 
for purposes of determining a primary beneficiary  all related party interests must be combined with the actual interests of the company in the vie 
the application of this interpretation is immediate for vie s created or altered after january   and is effective at the end of the first interim or annual period ending after december   for variable interest entities that existed prior to february  the partnership is currently working to locate investors for a partnership with a target amount of million in equity capital 
upon funding this million target  this new partnership will seek to place the raised capital in timberland investments 
the partnership will invest of the equity capital in the fund so that  for example  if the target of million is reached pope resources will have contributed million of that equity total 
orm timber fund i  lp is expected to be classified as a vie and will need to be consolidated into the partnership s financial statements since an indirect subsidiary of the partnership olympic resource management llc will act as manager and general partner of this partnership 
critical accounting policies and estimates we believe our most critical accounting policies and estimates include those related to management s calculation of timber depletion and liabilities related to matters such as environmental remediation  potential asset impairments  and valuation allowance on deferred tax assets 
in relation to liabilities  potential impairments and other estimated charges  it is management s policy to conduct ongoing reviews of significant accounting policies and assumptions used in the preparation of the financial results of the partnership 
the assumptions used are tested against available and relevant information and reviewed with subject matter experts for consistency and reliability 
during the preparation of financial results  when facts or circumstances indicate that asset impairment may exist  tests are conducted to ascertain that the net book carrying values of these assets are not in excess of fair values 
these tests use current market information  if available  or other generally accepted valuation methods  such as future cash flows 
when the use of estimates is necessary  an exact answer is unlikely  and therefore  the reporting within a range of likely outcomes is used in the preparation of the financial statements 
tests are also applied in order to be reasonably assured that liabilities are properly reflected on the records of the partnership and that the notes to the financial statements are prepared in a fashion that informs readers of possible outcomes and risks associated with the conduct of business 
depletion depletion represents the cost of timber harvested and is charged to operations by applying a depletion rate to volume harvested during the period 
the depletion rate is calculated on january st of each year by dividing the partnership s cost of merchantable timber by the volume of merchantable timber 
merchantable timber is defined as timber that is equal to or greater than years of age 
to calculate the depletion rate the partnership has determined that a combined pool representing costs and volume of both the hood canal and columbia tree farms is the most appropriate method to use 
inventory volumes take into account the applicable state and federal regulatory limits on timber harvests as applied to the partnership s properties  including the new forests and fish law that supplements washington state s forest practice regulations to provide for expanded riparian management zones  wildlife leave trees  and other harvest restrictions 
timber inventory volume is accounted for by the partnership s standing timber inventory system  which utilizes annual statistical sampling of the timber cruising with annual adjustments made for estimated growth and the depletion of areas harvested 
the standing inventory system is subject to two processes each year to monitor accuracy 
the first is the annual cruise process and the second is a comparison of a volume actually extracted by harvest to b inventory in the standing inventory system at the time of the harvest 
a cruise represents a physical measurement of timber on a specific set of acres 
the cruise process is completed when the physical measurement totals are compared to the inventory in the standing inventory system 
only productive acres with timber that is at least years old are selected to cruise 
the partnership cruised of its productive acres with year old or greater timber in and plans to continue to cruise for at least the next few years 
specific acres are first selected for cruising with a bias towards those acres that have gone the longest without a cruise and  second  with a bias towards those acres that have been growing the longest 
as the cruise is being performed  only those trees with a breast height diameter approximately feet from the ground of at least inches are measured for inclusion in the inventory 
a change in estimated timber inventory volume would have changed depletion expense by  environmental remediation the environmental remediation liability represents estimated payments to be made to remedy and monitor certain areas in and around the townsite of port gamble 
port gamble is a historic town that was owned and operated by p t  a related party  until when the townsite and other assets were spun off to the partnership 
p t continued to operate the townsite until and leased the mill site at port gamble through january  at which point p t signed an agreement with the partnership dividing the responsibility for environmental remediation of port gamble between the two parties 
the environmental remediation liability on the partnership s books is based upon an estimate of the partnership s portion of the clean up costs under this agreement with p t 
during the environmental liability increased  as a result of costs to complete the partnership s share exceeding the original estimate 
while the majority of the partnership s portion of the clean up efforts is complete  there remains the possibility that the remaining remediation or monitoring activities may exceed estimates  resulting in an additional environmental remediation charge 
management will continue to monitor the remaining liability against estimates to complete to determine if an adjustment to the environmental remediation liability is necessary to accurately represent management s estimate of remaining cost to complete the project 
deferred tax assets the partnership has a united states subsidiary corporation that has million of deferred tax assets as of december  the majority of this balance represents net operating loss carryforwards resulting from the liquidation of our subsidiary in canada 
management evaluates the likelihood of earning taxable income to absorb net operating loss carryforwards each reporting period to determine if deferred tax assets are likely to be utilized 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk as of december   the partnership had million of fixed rate debt outstanding with a fair value of approximately million based on the current interest rates for similar financial instruments 
a change in the interest rate on fixed rate debt will affect the fair value of the debt  whereas a change in the interest rate on variable rate debt will affect interest expense and cash flows 
a hypothetical change in prevailing interest rates would change the fair value of the partnership s fixed rate long term debt obligations by million 
since the partnership s currently outstanding debt is fixed rate  net income and cash flows are not affected when market interest rates change
