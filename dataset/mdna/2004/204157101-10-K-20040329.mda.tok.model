unless otherwise stated  company refers to this consolidated entity 
it should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and the other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report 
forward looking statements this annual report on form k contains statements that constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
those forward looking statements include statements regarding the intent  belief or current expectations of the company and its management 
any such forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties  and actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
such risks and uncertainties include changes in the interest rate environment reducing interest rate margins or increasing interest rate risk reduction in our earnings by losses on loans deterioration in general economic conditions the regulation of the banking industry dependence on real estate risks of natural disasters increased competitive pressure among financial services companies operational risks legislative or regulatory changes adversely affecting the business in which the company engages the availability of sources of liquidity at a reasonable cost other risks and uncertainties that may be detailed herein overview of earnings performance in  the net income of the company was million  or  per basic and diluted shares 
this represents a million increase in net income over the significant factors impacting net income for compared to were the decision in to exit both the high loan to value hltv and the high yielding short term consumer stcl lending businesses impacted the company both positively  with overall improved credit quality and a related reduction to the allowance for loan losses  and negatively  with a reduction to net interest and non interest income during shifts in the mortgage business  which were positive until rising rates in the fall of increased prepayments in the securitized loan portfolio that decreased the volume of interest earning assets and accelerated amortization of related deferred loan costs reduction in expenses due to continued cost control efforts as well as the changes to business lines made in the impact to the company from these items  and others of both a positive and negative nature  will be discussed in more detail as they pertain to the company s performance for throughout the analysis sections of this report 
external factors that may affect future results of operations economic conditions nationally  the banking industry and the company have been affected by the steady growth in the economy and the actions of the federal reserve board to manage this growth by cutting interest rates to the lowest levels in over years 
the changes in interest rates have impacted the company as market rates for loans  investments and deposits have remained near an all time low for a substantial period 
gnb serves three primary regions 
the tri counties region which consists of san luis obispo  santa barbara and ventura counties in the state of california  the sba western region where gnb originates sba loans california  washington  oregon and colorado and the sba southeast region georgia  florida  tennessee  alabama  north carolina and south carolina 
the forecast for the tri counties area is generally positive for the coming years  but california has its own unique problems  as budget  and certain health insurance related matters have discouraged business investment in california and slowed economic growth 
gnb s sba western region has experienced modest growth 
non planned retail expenditures should remain stable with modest growth forecasted 
in addition  no significant economic growth is anticipated for the immediate future 
the economy relative to our sba southeast region continues to remain sluggish 
also continuing to impact the company is the nation s lingering slow recovery in the tourism and hospitality sectors from the tragedy of september  regulatory considerations the financial services industry is heavily regulated 
the company is subject to federal and state regulation designed to protect the deposits of consumers  not to benefit shareholders 
these regulations include the following the amount of capital the company must maintain the types of activities in which it can engage the types and amounts of investments it can make the locations of its offices insurance of the company s deposits and the premiums paid for this insurance how much cash the company must set aside as reserves for deposits the regulations impose significant limitations on operations and may be changed at any time  possibly causing future results to vary significantly from past results 
government policy and regulation  particularly as implemented through the federal reserve system  significantly affects credit conditions 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations supervision and regulation 
bank regulations could discourage changes in the company s ownership bank regulations could delay or discourage a potential acquirer who might have been willing to pay a premium price to acquire a large block of common stock 
that possibility could decrease the value of the company s common stock and the price that a stockholder will receive if shares are sold in the future 
before anyone can buy enough voting stock to exercise control over a bank holding company like cwbc  bank regulators must approve the acquisition 
a stockholder must apply for regulatory approval to own percent or more of the company s common stock  unless the stockholder can show that they will not actually exert control over the company 
regardless  no stockholder can own more than percent of the company s common stock without applying for regulatory approval 
the price of the company s common stock may change rapidly and significantly the market price of the company s common stock could change rapidly and significantly at any time 
the market price of the company s common stock has fluctuated in recent years 
between january  and december   the market price of its common stock ranged from a low of per share to a high of per share 
fluctuations may occur  among other reasons  in response to short term or long term operating results regulatory action or adverse publicity perceived value of the company s loan portfolio trends in the company s nonperforming assets announcements by competitors economic changes general market conditions perceived strength of the banking industry in general legislative and regulatory changes the trading price of the company s common stock may continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to the factors set forth above and other factors  many of which are beyond the company s control 
the stock market can experience extreme price and trading volume fluctuations that often are unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of individual companies 
the company believes that investors should consider the likelihood of these market fluctuations before investing in the company s common stock 
dependence on real estate approximately of the loan portfolio of the company is secured by various forms of real estate  including residential and commercial real estate 
a decline in current economic conditions or rising interest rates could have an adverse effect on the demand for new loans  the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans and the value of real estate and other collateral securing loans 
the real estate securing the company s loan portfolio is concentrated in california 
if real estate values decline significantly  especially in california  the change could harm the financial condition of the company s borrowers  the collateral for its loans will provide less security and the company would be more likely to suffer losses on defaulted loans 
curtailment of government guaranteed loan programs could affect an important segment of the company s business a major segment of the company s business consists of originating and selling government guaranteed loans  in particular those guaranteed by the sba 
from time to time  the government agencies that guarantee these loans reach their internal limits and cease to guarantee loans 
in addition  these agencies may change their rules for loans or congress may adopt legislation that would have the effect of discontinuing or changing the programs 
non governmental programs could replace government programs for some borrowers  but the terms might not be equally acceptable 
therefore  if these changes occur  the volume of loans to small business  industrial and agricultural borrowers of the types that now qualify for government guaranteed loans could decline 
also  the profitability of these loans could decline 
as of january  the sba implemented a maximum loan size of  in its a loan program due to a perceived shortfall in the program s fiscal authorized funding  which they anticipate may not meet funding demands 
ongoing discussions of potential resolutions to the budget deficit include shrinking the guaranteed percentage on loans and higher fees to lenders 
as the funding and sale of the guaranteed portion of a loans is a significant portion of the company s business  the long term resolution to the funding for the a loan program may have an unfavorable impact on the company s future performance and results of operations 
environmental laws could force the company to pay for environmental problems when a borrower defaults on a loan secured by real property  the company generally purchases the property in foreclosure or accepts a deed to the property surrendered by the borrower 
the company may also take over the management of commercial properties when owners have defaulted on loans 
while gnb has guidelines intended to exclude properties with an unreasonable risk of contamination  hazardous substances may exist on some of the properties that it owns  manages or occupies 
the company faces the risk that environmental laws could force it to clean up the properties at the company s expense 
it may cost much more to clean a property than the property is worth 
the company could also be liable for pollution generated by a borrower s operations if the company took a role in managing those operations after default 
resale of contaminated properties may also be difficult 
earnings performance in  the net income of the company was million  or  per basic and diluted shares 
return on average assets and average equity were and in  compared with and for during  the company continued to be positively impacted by its decision in to reduce risk and exit the high yield stcl and hltv lending businesses 
low interest rates  shifts in the mortgage business  and the continued rapid paydown in the securitized loan portfolio also contributed to the results both positively  on provision for loan losses and negatively  to net interest margin 
the provision for loan losses decreased by million from million for to million for the exit from stcl in accounted for million of this decline 
the other significant reason for this decrease was the million reduction in the sba loan provision from to the company strengthened its sba credit underwriting standards at the end of that has resulted in a continued decline in problem loans in the sba portfolio 
the securitized loan loss provision also experienced a decline for from of  as a result of the reduced principal balances 
the net result in interest income after provision for loan losses was a  or million  decline from million for the year ended december  to million for the company has diligently worked to replace the high yield assets it lost 
the company s net income declined million from to the primary reasons for this decline were the million net proceeds from a legal settlement the company received in as well as the costs in associated with the company s decision to exit the hltv and stcl lending businesses and consolidate the mortgage and sba lending offices  and included million in asset writedowns 
changes in interest income and interest expense net interest income is the difference between the interest and fees earned on loans and investments and the interest expense paid on deposits and other liabilities 
the amount by which interest income will exceed interest expense depends on the volume or balance of earning assets compared to the volume or balance of interest bearing deposits and liabilities and the interest rate earned on those interest earning assets compared to the interest rate paid on those interest bearing liabilities 
net interest margin is net interest income expressed as a percentage of average earning assets 
it is used to measure the difference between the average rate of interest earned on assets and the average rate of interest that is paid on liabilities used to fund those assets 
to maintain its net interest margin  the company must manage the relationship between interest earned and paid

the decrease in loan interest from the securitized portfolio is a result of the million net decrease in the portfolio during this decrease in the securitized loan portfolio also indirectly accounted for of the million decline in interest expense as the related bonds paid down by million  or 
the remaining decrease in interest expense is the result of declines in average effective rates on interest bearing deposits of on time certificates of deposits and on interest bearing demand and savings deposits 
total interest income decreased from million in to million in total interest expense decreased from million in to million in the decrease in both interest income and interest expense was primarily due to a decline in interest rates  the sale of palomar which is included in the income statement for for seven and one half months only  and  a prepayment rate of approximately experienced in gnb s securitized loan portfolio 
in addition  the company was moderately asset sensitive during this period of declining interest rates

the company s income from managing assets consists of the difference between the interest income received from its loan portfolio and investments and the interest expense paid on its liabilities  primarily interest paid on deposits 
this difference or spread is net interest income 
net interest income  when expressed as a percentage of average total interest earning assets  is referred to as net interest margin on interest earning assets 
the company s net interest income is affected by the change in the level and the mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  referred to as volume changes 
the company s net yield on interest earning assets is also affected by changes in the yields earned on assets and rates paid on liabilities  referred to as rate changes 
interest rates charged on the company s loans are affected principally by the demand for such loans  the supply of money available for lending purposes  competitive factors and general economic conditions such as federal economic policies  legislative tax policies and governmental budgetary matters

loan portfolio the company s largest categories of loans held in the portfolio are commercial loans  real estate loans  sba loans  installment loans including manufactured housing and second mortgage loans 
loans are carried at face amount  net of payments collected  the allowance for loan losses  deferred loan fees costs and discounts on loans purchased 
interest on all loans is accrued daily  primarily on a simple interest basis 
it is the company s policy to place a loan on nonaccrual status when the loan is days past due 
thereafter  previously recorded interest is reversed and interest income is typically recognized on a cash basis 
the rates charged on variable rate loans are set at specific increments 
these increments vary in relation to the company s published prime lending rate or other appropriate indices 
at december   approximately of the company s loan portfolio was comprised of variable interest rate loans 
at december  and  variable rate loans comprised approximately and  respectively  of the company s loan portfolio 
management monitors the maturity of loans and the sensitivity of loans to changes in interest rates

commercial loans in addition to traditional term commercial loans made to business customers  gnb grants revolving business lines of credit 
under the terms of the revolving lines of credit  gnb grants a maximum loan amount  which remains available to the business during the loan term 
as part of the loan requirements  the business agrees to maintain its primary banking relationship with gnb 
gnb does not extend material loans of this type in excess of one year 
real estate loans real estate loans are primarily made for the purpose of purchasing  improving or constructing single family residences  commercial or industrial properties 
the majority of the company s mortgage loans are collateralized by liens on single family homes 
a majority of these loans are sold servicing released into the secondary market 
a substantial portion of the company s real estate construction loans are first and second trust deeds on the construction of owner occupied single family dwellings 
the company also makes real estate construction loans on commercial properties 
these consist of first and second trust deeds collateralized by the related real property 
construction loans are generally written with terms of six to twelve months and usually do not exceed a loan to appraised value of 
commercial and industrial real estate loans are secured by nonresidential property 
office buildings or other commercial property primarily secure these loans 
loan to appraised value ratios on nonresidential real estate loans are generally restricted to of appraised value of the underlying real property 
unguaranteed portion of sba loans under the sba a loan program  the company is required to retain a minimum of of the unguaranteed portion of loans it originates and sells into the secondary market 
at december   the company had million in unguaranteed sba loans 
manufactured housing loans the mortgage loan center originates loans secured by manufactured housing primarily located in parks along the central coast of california 
at december   the bank had million in its portfolio 
the loans are serviced internally and are generally written for terms of to years with balloon payments ranging from to years 
other installment loans installment loans consist of automobile  small equity lines of credit  loans secured by manufactured housing and general purpose loans made to individuals 
these loans are primarily fixed rate 
included in this category as of december  is approximately million of the company s short term consumer lending product  which consists of day loans to individuals 
no such new loans were originated in and no loans of this type were in the company s loan portfolio as of december  second mortgage loans the company originated second mortgage loans with loan to value ratios as high as 
in and  the company transferred million and million of these loans  respectively  to special purpose trusts trusts 
the trusts then sold bonds to third party investors  which were secured by the transferred loans 
the bonds are held in a trust independent of the company  the trustee of which oversees the distribution to the bondholders 
the mortgage loans are serviced by a third party servicer  who receives a stated servicing fee 
there is an insurance policy on the subordinate bonds that guarantees the payment of the bonds 
as part of the securitization agreements  the company received an option to repurchase the bonds when the aggregate principal balance of the mortgage loans sold declined to or less of the original balance of mortgage loans securitized 
because the company has a call option to reacquire the loans transferred and did not retain the servicing rights  the company was deemed to not have surrendered effective control over the loans transferred 
therefore  the securitizations are accounted for as secured borrowings with a pledge of collateral 
accordingly  the company consolidates the trusts and the financial statements of the company include the loans transferred and the related bonds issued 
the securitized loans are classified as held for investment 
at december  and  the net balance of the securitized loan portfolio was million and million  respectively 
the related net bond balances were million and million at december  and  respectively 
loan commitments outstanding the company s loan commitments outstanding at the dates indicated are summarized below december  in thousands commercial      real estate      sba      installment loans      standby letters of credit total commitments      the company makes loans to borrowers in a number of different industries 
other than manufactured housing  no single industry comprises or more of the company s loan portfolio 
at december   manufactured housing comprised of the company s loan portfolio 
commercial real estate loans and sba loans comprised over of the company s loan portfolio as of december  and  but consisted of diverse borrowers 
although the company does not have significant concentrations in its loan portfolio  the ability of the company s customers to honor their loan agreements is dependent upon  among other things  the general economy of the company s market areas

the relationship banking and the manufactured housing all increased by a total of  primarily due to loan growth  which partially offset the aforementioned decreases 
the securitized loan loss allowance changed primarily due to the significant principal balance payments in of million  or  as well as a decrease in net charge offs from the decrease in all for the sba loans is a result of a reduction of  in sba classified loans from million at december  to million at december  and a reduction in the related specific all reserve deemed necessary against these loans of  from to the sba portfolio has also experienced a decrease in net charge offs of  or  from million for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  loans charged off  net of recoveries  were million in  million in and million in the primary reason for the decline in net charge offs in was the significant paydown in the securitized loan portfolio and the exit from short term consumer lending 
the company has also experienced continued increases in the sba portfolio credit quality 
towards the end of  the company strengthened its underwriting standards in the sba program  which management believes has subsequently influenced the decline in problem loans in the sba portfolio 
in management s opinion  the balance of the allowance for loan losses was sufficient to absorb known and inherent probable losses in the loan portfolio as of december  the company recorded million as a provision for loan losses in  million in and million in the primary reason for the decrease in provision expense is the company s change in portfolio mix to perceived less risky loans 
the company exited the hltv and stcl markets and the securitized loan portfolio paid down by approximately 
a loan is considered impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that the company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest under the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status  collateral value and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments 
loans that experience insignificant payment delays or payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired 
management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case by case basis 
when determining the possibility of impairment  management considers the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower  including the length of the delay  the reasons for the delay  the borrower s prior payment record and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed 
for collateral dependent loans  the company uses the fair value of collateral method to measure impairment 
all other loans  except for securitized  are measured for impairment based on the present value of future cash flows 
impairment is measured on a loan by loan basis for all loans in the portfolio except for the securitized loans  which are evaluated for impairment on a collective basis 
the recorded investment in loans that are considered to be impaired is as follows year ended december  in thousands impaired loans without specific valuation allowances  impaired loans with specific valuation allowances      specific valuation allowance related to impaired loans     impaired loans  net      average investment in impaired loans      the following schedule reflects recorded investment at the dates indicated in certain types of loans year ended december  in thousands nonaccrual loans     sba guaranteed portion of loans included above     nonaccrual loans  net      troubled debt restructured loans  loans through days past due with interest accruing      interest income recognized on impaired loans  interest foregone on nonaccrual loans and troubled debt restructured loans outstanding    gross interest income on impaired loans    gross up information for comparison not readily available 
the accrual of interest is discontinued when substantial doubt exists as to collectibility of the loan  generally at the time the loan is days delinquent 
any unpaid but accrued interest is reversed at that time 
thereafter  interest income is no longer recognized on the loan 
as such  interest income may be recognized on impaired loans to the extent they are not past due by days 
interest on nonaccrual loans is accounted for on the cash basis or cost recovery method  until qualifying for return to accrual 
loans are returned to accrual status when all of the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured 
all of the nonaccrual loans are impaired 
total impaired loans decreased by million  or  in the specific valuation allowances allocated to impaired loans also decreased  which resulted in a net decrease in impaired loans of  or 
financial difficulties encountered by certain borrowers may cause the company to restructure the terms of their loan to facilitate loan repayment 
a troubled debt restructured loan tdr would generally be considered impaired 
the balance of impaired loans disclosed above includes all tdrs that  as of december   and  are considered impaired 
total tdrs decreased by  or  from  to  as of december  and  respectively 
the company s net nonaccrual loans also decreased from december  to december  this decrease is primarily a result in the improvements in credit quality experienced in the sba loan portfolio

mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations are distributed in total based on average expected maturities 
interest only strips and servicing assets as of december  and  the company held interest only strips in the amount of million and million  respectively 
these interest only strips represent the present value of the right to the estimated net cash flows generated by sba loans sold 
net cash flows consist of the difference between a interest at the stated rate paid by borrowers and b the sum of i pass through interest paid to third party investors and ii contractual servicing fees 
the company also held servicing assets related to sba loans sales of million and million at december  and  respectively 
for loans sold subsequent to march   the initial servicing assets and resulting gain on sale were calculated based on the difference between the best actual par and premium bids on an individual loan basis 
the servicing asset balances are subsequently amortized over the estimated life of the loans using an estimated prepayment rate of 
quarterly  the servicing asset and i o strip assets are analyzed for impairment 
in  the company recorded a million impairment charge related to the valuation of the servicing assets and i o strips 
the interest only strips are accounted for as investments in debt securities classified as trading securities 
accordingly  the company marks them to fair value with the resulting increase or decrease recorded through operations in the current period 
at december   all of the servicing assets are related to sba loan sales 
as of december  and prior to april   the company utilized a cpr assumption of  which is the weighted average actual prepayment speed experienced by all serviced loans that have been in the portfolio for more than two years 
this prepayment speed assumption is applied to all loans including those that have been in the portfolio for less than two years 
during the same period  the company used discount rates of to 
liquidity management the company has established policies as well as analytical tools to manage liquidity 
proper liquidity management ensures that sufficient funds are available to meet normal operating demands in addition to unexpected customer demand for funds  such as high levels of deposit withdrawals or increased loan demand  in a timely and cost effective manner 
the most important factor in the preservation of liquidity is maintaining public confidence that facilitates the retention and growth of core deposits 
ultimately  public confidence is gained through profitable operations  sound credit quality and a strong capital position 
the company s liquidity management is viewed from both a long term and short term perspective as well as from an asset and liability perspective 
management monitors liquidity through regular reviews of maturity profiles  funding sources and loan and deposit forecasts to minimize funding risk 
the company has asset liability committees alco at the board and bank management level to review asset liability management and liquidity issues 
the company maintains strategic liquidity and contingency plans 
periodically  the company has significantly used short term time certificates from other financial institutions to meet projected liquidity needs 
recently  the company has invested more resources in the purchase of government guaranteed investment securities and obtained a financing arrangement  repurchase agreements repos that allow it to pledge these securities as collateral for short term borrowing in case of increased liquidity needs 
repos give the company improved flexibility in managing its liquidity resources 
as of december   the company had million of outstanding repos  with interest rates of to  all of which mature within one year 
the company has recently been approved for membership in the federal home loan bank fhlb  which will allow for certain loans to be pledged as collateral to use as an additional  and generally less expensive  funding source 
the company also has obtained from another financial institution a million federal funds purchased borrowing line 
the company  through the bank  also has the ability as a member of the federal reserve system  to borrow at the discount window up to of what is pledged at the federal reserve bank 
on january   the reserve bank replaced the existing discount window program with new primary and secondary credit programs 
gnb qualifies for primary credit as it has been deemed to be in sound financial condition 
the rate on primary credit will be basis points less than the secondary credit rate and will generally be granted on a no questions asked basis at a rate that initially will be at basis points above the federal open market committee s fomc target federal funds rate currently at 
as the rate is currently not attractive  it is unlikely it will be used as a regular source of funding  but is noted as available as an alternative funding source 
the company has not experienced disintermediation and does not believe this is a potentially probable occurrence 
gnb s core deposits excluding certificates of deposit grew by approximately million during the liquidity ratio of the company has steadily increased and was  and at december  and and  respectively 
the liquidity ratio consists of cash and due from banks  deposits in other financial institutions  available for sale investments  federal funds sold and loans held for sale  divided by total assets 
cwbc s routine funding requirements primarily consist of certain operating expenses 
normally  cwbc obtains funding to meet its obligations from dividends collected from its subsidiaries and has the capability to issue debt securities 
federal banking laws regulate the amount of dividends that may be paid by banking subsidiaries without prior approval 
interest rate risk the company is exposed to different types of interest rate risks 
these risks include lag  repricing  basis and prepayment risk 
lag risk lag risk results from the inherent timing difference between the repricing of the company s adjustable rate assets and liabilities 
for instance  certain loans tied to the prime rate index may only reprice on a quarterly basis 
however  at a community bank such as gnb  when rates are rising  funding sources tend to reprice more slowly than the loans 
therefore  for gnb  the effect of this timing difference is generally favorable during a period of rising interest rates and unfavorable during a period of declining interest rates 
this lag can produce some short term volatility  particularly in times of numerous prime rate changes 
the last prime rate change was effected on june  repricing risk repricing risk is caused by the mismatch in the maturities repricing periods between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
if gnb was perfectly matched  the net interest margin would expand during rising rate periods and contract during falling rate periods 
this is so since loans tend to reprice more quickly than do funding sources 
typically  since gnb is somewhat asset sensitive  this would also tend to expand the net interest margin during times of interest rate increases 
basis risk item pricing tied to different indices may tend to react differently  however  all gnb s variable products are priced off the prime rate 
prepayment risk prepayment risk results from borrowers paying down off their loans prior to maturity 
prepayments on fixed rate products increase in falling interest rate environments and decrease in rising interest rate environments 
since a majority of gnb s loan originations are adjustable rate and set based on prime  and there is little lag time on the reset  gnb does not experience significant prepayments 
however  gnb does have more prepayment risk on its securitized and manufactured housing loans and its mortgage backed investment securities 
offsetting the prepayment risk on the securitized loans are the related bonds payable  which were issued at a fixed rate 
when the bonds payable prepay  given the current interest rate environment  this reduces gnb s interest expense as a higher  fixed rate is  in effect  traded for a lower  variable rate funding source 
management of interest rate risk to mitigate the impact of changes in market interest rates on the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the amounts and maturities are actively managed 
short term  adjustable rate assets are generally retained as they have similar repricing characteristics as our funding sources 
gnb sells mortgage products and a portion of its sba loan originations 
while the company has some interest rate exposure in excess of five years  it has internal policy limits designed to minimize risk should interest rates rise 
currently  the company does not use derivative instruments to help manage risk  but will consider such instruments in the future if the perceived need should arise 
loan sales the company s ability to originate  purchase and sell loans is also significantly impacted by changes in interest rates 
increases in interest rates may also reduce the amount of loan and commitment fees received by gnb 
a significant decline in interest rates could also decrease the size of the gnb s servicing portfolio and the related servicing income by increasing the level of prepayments 
operational risk operational risk represents the risk of loss resulting from the company s operations  including but not limited to  the risk of fraud by employees or persons outside the company  the execution of unauthorized transactions by employees  transaction processing errors and breaches of internal control system and compliance requirements 
this risk of loss also includes the potential legal actions that could arise as a result of an operational deficiency or as a result of noncompliance with applicable regulatory standards  adverse business decisions or their implementation and customer attrition due to potential negative publicity 
operational risk is inherent in all business activities and the management of this risk is important to the achievement of the company s objectives 
in the event of a breakdown in the internal control system  improper operation of systems or improper employee actions  the company could suffer financial loss  face regulatory action and suffer damage to its reputation 
the company manages operational risk through a risk management framework and its internal control processes 
the framework involves business units  corporate risk management personnel and executive management 
under this framework  the business units have direct and primary responsibility and accountability for identifying  controlling and monitoring operational risk 
business unit managers maintain a system of controls with the objective of providing proper transaction authorization and execution  proper system operations  safeguarding of assets from misuse or theft and ensuring the reliability of financial and other data 
business unit managers ensure that the controls are appropriate and are implemented as designed 
business continuation and disaster recovery planning is also critical to effectively manage operational risks 
the company s internal audit function currently outsourced to a third party validates the system of internal controls through risk based regular and ongoing audit procedures and reports on the effectiveness of internal controls to executive management and the audit committee of the board 
while the company believes that it has designed effective methods to minimize operational risks  there is no absolute assurance that business disruption or operational losses would not occur in the event of disaster

however  management does not believe that deposit levels are significantly influenced by seasonal factors 
the company manages its money desk in accordance with its liquidity and strategic planning 
such deposits increased by million during as the company s general funding needs increased due to the increase in loan originations 
the company can obtain funds when necessary in a short timeframe  however  it is more expensive as there is substantial competition for these deposits 
contractual obligations the company has contractual obligations that include long term debt  deposits  operating leases and purchase obligations for service providers

bank holding company liquidity the company is a legal entity  separate and distinct from gnb 
although it has the ability to raise capital on its own behalf or borrow from external sources  the company may also obtain additional funds through dividends paid by  and fees for services provided to  gnb 
however  regulatory constraints may restrict or totally preclude gnb from paying dividends to the company 
see limitations on dividend payments 
the frb s policy regarding dividends provides that a bank holding company should not pay cash dividends exceeding its net income or which can only be funded in ways  such as by borrowing  that weaken the bank holding company s financial health or its ability to act as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary banks 
the frb also possesses enforcement powers over bank holding companies and their non bank subsidiaries to prevent or remedy actions that represent unsafe or unsound practices or violations of applicable statutes and regulations 
transactions with affiliates the company and any subsidiaries it may purchase or organize are deemed to be affiliates of the bank subsidiary within the meaning of sections a and b of the federal reserve act  herein referred to as the fra  as amended 
pursuant thereto  loans by gnb to affiliates  investments by gnb in affiliates stock and taking affiliates stock as collateral for loans to any borrower will be limited to of gnb s capital  in the case of any one affiliate  and will be limited to of gnb s capital in the case of all affiliates 
in addition  such transactions must be on terms and conditions that are consistent with safe and sound banking practices 
specifically  a bank and its subsidiaries generally may not purchase from an affiliate a low quality asset  as defined in the fra 
such restrictions also prevent a bank holding company and its other affiliates from borrowing from a banking subsidiary of the bank holding company unless the loans are secured by marketable collateral of designated amounts 
the company and gnb are also subject to certain restrictions with respect to engaging in the underwriting  public sale and distribution of securities 
see supervision and regulation of the bank subsidiary significant legislation 
limitations on businesses and investment activities under the bhca  a bank holding company must obtain the frb s approval before directly or indirectly acquiring more than ownership or control of any voting shares of another bank or bank holding company acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of another bank merging or consolidating with another bank holding company the frb may allow a bank holding company to acquire banks located in any state of the united states without regard to whether the acquisition is prohibited by the law of the state in which the target bank is located 
in approving interstate acquisitions  however  the frb must give effect to applicable state laws limiting the aggregate amount of deposits that may be held by the acquiring bank holding company and its insured depository institutions in the state in which the target bank is located  provided that those limits do not discriminate against out of state depository institutions or their holding companies  and state laws which require that the target bank have been in existence for a minimum period of time  not to exceed five years  before being acquired by an out of state bank holding company 
in general  the bhca prohibits a bank holding company from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than of the voting securities of a company that is not a bank or a bank holding company 
however  with frb consent  a bank holding company may own subsidiaries engaged in certain businesses that the frb has determined to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto 
the company  therefore  is permitted to engage in a variety of banking related businesses 
some of the activities that the frb has determined  pursuant to its regulation y  to be related to banking are making or acquiring loans or other extensions of credit for its own account or for the account of others servicing loans and other extensions of credit operating a trust company in the manner authorized by federal or state law under certain circumstances leasing personal and real property or acting as agent  broker  or adviser in leasing such property in accordance with various restrictions imposed by frb regulations acting as investment or financial advisor providing management consulting advice under certain circumstances providing support services  including courier services and printing and selling micr encoded items acting as a principal  agent or broker for insurance under certain circumstances making equity and debt investments in corporations or projects designed primarily to promote community welfare or jobs for residents providing financial  banking or economic data processing and data transmission services owning  controlling or operating a savings association under certain circumstances selling money orders  travelers checks and us savings bonds providing securities brokerage services  related securities credit activities pursuant to regulation t and other incidental activities underwriting and dealing in obligations of the united states  general obligations of states and their political subdivisions and other obligations authorized for state member banks under federal law generally  the bhca does not place territorial restrictions on the domestic activities of non bank subsidiaries of bank holding companies 
federal law prohibits a bank holding company and any subsidiary banks from engaging in certain tie in arrangements in connection with the extension of credit 
thus  for example  gnb may not extend credit  lease or sell property  or furnish any services  or fix or vary the consideration for any of the foregoing on the condition that the customer must obtain or provide some additional credit  property or services from or to gnb other than a loan  discount  deposit or trust service the customer must obtain or provide some additional credit  property or service from or to the company or gnb the customer may not obtain some other credit  property or services from competitors  except reasonable requirements to assure soundness of credit extended in  the gramm leach bliley act glb was enacted 
glb significantly changed the regulatory structure and oversight of the financial services industry 
glb permits banks and bank holding companies to engage in previously prohibited activities under certain conditions 
also  under certain conditions  banks and bank holding companies may affiliate with other financial service providers such as insurance companies and securities firms 
consequently  a qualifying bank holding company  called a financial holding company fhc  can engage in a full range of financial activities  including banking  insurance and securities activities  as well as merchant banking and additional activities that are beyond those traditionally permitted for bank holding companies 
moreover  various non bank financial service providers who were previously prohibited from engaging in banking can now acquire banks while also offering services such as securities underwriting and underwriting and brokering insurance products 
glb also expands passive investment activities by fhcs  permitting them to indirectly invest in any type of company  financial or non financial  through merchant banking activities and insurance company affiliations 
see supervision and regulation of the bank subsidiary significant legislation 
capital adequacy bank holding companies must maintain minimum levels of capital under the frb s risk based capital adequacy guidelines 
if capital falls below minimum guideline levels  a bank holding company  among other things  may be denied approval to acquire or establish additional banks or non bank businesses 
the frb s risk based capital adequacy guidelines for bank holding companies and state member banks  discussed in more detail below see supervision and regulation of the bank subsidiary risk based capital guidelines  assign various risk percentages to different categories of assets and capital is measured as a percentage of those risk assets 
under the terms of the guidelines  bank holding companies are expected to meet capital adequacy guidelines based both on total risk assets and on total assets  without regard to risk weights 
the risk based guidelines are minimum requirements 
higher capital levels will be required if warranted by the particular circumstances or risk profiles of individual organizations 
for example  the frb s capital guidelines contemplate that additional capital may be required to take adequate account of  among other things  interest rate risk  the risks posed by concentrations of credit or risks associated with nontraditional banking activities or securities trading activities 
moreover  any banking organization experiencing or anticipating significant growth or expansion into new activities  particularly under the expanded powers of glb  may be expected to maintain capital ratios  including tangible capital positions  well above the minimum levels 
limitations on dividend payments the company is entitled to receive dividends when and as declared by gnb s board  out of funds legally available for dividends  as specified and limited by the occ s regulations 
pursuant to the occ s regulations  funds available for a national bank s dividends are restricted to the lesser of the bank s i retained earnings  or ii net income for the current and past two fiscal years less any dividends paid during that period  unless approved by the occ 
furthermore  if the occ determines that a dividend would cause a bank s capital to be impaired or that payment would cause it to be undercapitalized  the occ can prohibit payment of a dividend notwithstanding that funds are legally available 
since gnb is an fdic insured institution  it is also possible  depending upon its financial condition and other factors  that the fdic could assert that the payment of dividends or other payments might  under some circumstances  constitute an unsafe or unsound practice and  thus  prohibit those payments 
as a california corporation  the company s ability to pay dividends is subject to the dividend limitations of the california corporations code ccc 
section of the ccc allows the company to pay a dividend to its shareholders only to the extent that the company has retained earnings and  after the dividend  the company meets the following criteria its assets exclusive of goodwill and other intangible assets would be times its liabilities exclusive of deferred taxes  deferred income and other deferred credits  and its current assets would be at least equal to its current liabilities 
supervision and regulation of the bank subsidiary general banking is a complex  highly regulated industry 
the primary goals of the regulatory scheme are to maintain a safe and sound banking system  protect depositors and the fdic s insurance fund and facilitate to conduct of sound monetary policy 
in furtherance of these goals  congress and the states have created several largely autonomous regulatory agencies and enacted numerous laws that govern banks  bank holding companies and financial services industry 
consequently  gnb s growth and earnings performance can be affected not only by management decisions and general economic conditions  but also by the requirements of applicable state and federal statutes  regulations and the policies of various governmental regulatory authorities  including the occ  fdic and frb 
the system of supervision and regulation applicable to gnb governs most aspects of gnb s business  including the scope of permissible business investments reserves that must be maintained against deposits capital levels that must be maintained the nature and amount of collateral that may be taken to secure loans the establishment of new branches mergers and consolidations with other financial institutions the payment of dividends gnb  as a national banking association member  is also a member of the federal reserve system  and is subject to regulation  supervision and regular examination by the occ  fdic and frb 
gnb s deposits are insured by the fdic up to the maximum extent provided by law 
the regulations of these agencies govern most aspects of the gnb s business 
california law exempts all banks from usury limitations on interest rates 
the following summarizes the material elements of the regulatory framework that applies to gnb 
it does not describe all of the statutes  regulations and regulatory policies that are applicable 
also  it does not restate all of the requirements of the statutes  regulations and regulatory policies that are described 
consequently  the following summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the applicable statutes  regulations and regulatory policies may have material effect on gnb s business 
significant legislation in  glb was signed into law  significantly changing the regulatory structure and oversight of the financial services industry 
glb repealed the provisions of the glass steagall act that restricted banks and securities firms from affiliating 
it also revised the bhca to permit an fhc to engage in a full range of financial activities  including banking  insurance  securities and merchant banking activities 
it also permits fhcs to acquire many types of financial firms without the frb s prior approval 
glb thus provides expanded financial affiliation opportunities for existing bank holding companies and permits other financial service providers to acquire banks and become bank holding companies without ceasing any existing financial activities 
previously  a bank holding company could only engage in activities that were closely related to banking 
this limitation no longer applies to bank holding companies that qualify to be treated as fhc s 
to qualify as an fhc  a bank holding company s subsidiary depository institutions must be well capitalized  well managed and have at least a satisfactory community reinvestment act  herein referred to as cra  examination rating 
non qualifying bank holding companies are limited to activities that were permissible under the bhca as of november  glb changed the powers of national banks and their subsidiaries and made similar changes in the powers of state chartered banks and their subsidiaries 
national banks may now underwrite  deal in and purchase state and local revenue bonds 
subsidiaries of national banks may now engage in financial activities that the bank cannot itself engage in  except for general insurance underwriting and real estate development and investment 
for a subsidiary of a national bank to engage in these new financial activities  the national bank and its depository institution affiliates must be well capitalized  have at least satisfactory general  managerial and cra examination ratings and meet other qualification requirements relating to total assets  subordinated debt  capital  risk management and affiliate transactions 
subsidiaries of state chartered banks can exercise the same powers as national bank subsidiaries if they satisfy the same qualifying rules that apply to national banks  except that state chartered banks do not have to satisfy the managerial and debt rating requirements applicable to national banks 
glb also reformed the overall regulatory framework of the financial services industry 
to implement its underlying purposes  glb preempted conflicting state laws that would restrict the types of financial affiliations that are authorized or permitted under glb  subject to specified exceptions for state insurance laws and regulations 
with regard to securities laws  effective may   glb removed the current blanket exemption for banks from being considered brokers or dealers under the securities exchange act of and replaced it with a number of more limited exemptions 
thus  previously exempted banks may become subject to the broker dealer registration and supervision requirements of the securities exchange act of the exemption that prevented bank holding companies and banks that advised mutual funds from being considered investment advisers under the investment advisers act of was also eliminated 
separately  glb imposes customer privacy requirements on any company engaged in financial activities 
under these requirements  a financial company is required to protect the security and confidentiality of customer nonpublic personal information 
also  for customers that obtain a financial product such as a loan for personal  family or household purposes  a financial company is required to disclose its privacy policy to the customer at the time the relationship is established and annually thereafter  including its policies concerning the sharing of the customer s nonpublic personal information with affiliates and third parties 
if an exemption is not available  a financial company must provide consumers with a notice of its information sharing practices that allows the consumer to reject the disclosure of its nonpublic personal information to third parties 
third parties that receive such information are subject to the same restrictions as the financial company on the reuse of the information 
a financial company is prohibited from disclosing an account number or similar item to a third party for use in telemarketing  direct mail marketing or other marketing through electronic mail 
risk based capital guidelines general 
the federal banking agencies have established minimum capital standards known as risk based capital guidelines 
these guidelines are intended to provide a measure of capital that reflects the degree of risk associated with a bank s operations 
the risk based capital guidelines include both a new definition of capital and a framework for calculating the amount of capital that must be maintained against a bank s assets and off balance sheet items 
the amount of capital required to be maintained is based upon the credit risks associated with the various types of a bank s assets and off balance sheet items 
a bank s assets and off balance sheet items are classified under several risk categories  with each category assigned a particular risk weighting from to 
the bank s risk based capital ratio is calculated by dividing its qualifying capital numerator by the combined risk weights of its assets and off balance sheet items denominator 
a bank s total qualifying capital consists of two types of capital components core capital elements  known as tier capital  and supplementary capital elements  known as tier capital 
the tier component of a bank s qualifying capital must represent at least of total qualifying capital and may consist of the following items that are defined as core capital elements common stockholders equity and qualifying non cumulative perpetual preferred stock including related surplus minority interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries the tier component of a bank s total qualifying capital may consist of the following items a portion of the allowance for loan and lease losses certain types of perpetual preferred stock and related surplus certain types of hybrid capital instruments and mandatory convertible debt securities a portion of term subordinated debt and intermediate term preferred stock  including related surplus risk weighted assets and off balance sheet items 
assets and credit equivalent amounts of off balance sheet items are assigned to one of several broad risk classifications  according to the obligor or  if relevant  the guarantor or the nature of the collateral 
the aggregate dollar value of the amount in each risk classification is then multiplied by the risk weight associated with that classification 
the resulting weighted values from each of the risk classifications are added together 
this total is the bank s total risk weighted assets 
a two step process determines risk weights for off balance sheet items  such as unfunded loan commitments  letters of credit and recourse arrangements 
first  the credit equivalent amount of the off balance sheet items is determined  in most cases by multiplying the off balance sheet item by a credit conversion factor 
second  the credit equivalent amount is treated like any balance sheet asset and is assigned to the appropriate risk category according to the obligor or  if relevant  the guarantor or the nature of the collateral 
this result is added to the bank s risk weighted assets and comprises the denominator of the risk based capital ratio 
minimum capital standards 
the supervisory standards set forth below specify minimum capital ratios based primarily on broad risk considerations 
the risk based ratios do not take explicit account of the quality of individual asset portfolios or the range of other types of risks to which banks may be exposed  such as interest rate  liquidity  market or operational risks 
for this reason  banks are generally expected to operate with capital positions above the minimum ratios 
all banks are required to meet a minimum ratio of qualifying total capital to risk weighted assets of 
at least must be in the form of tier capital  net of goodwill 
the maximum amount of supplementary capital elements that qualifies as tier capital is limited to of tier capital  net of goodwill 
in addition  the combined maximum amount of term subordinated debt and intermediate term preferred stock that qualifies as tier capital for risk based capital purposes is limited to of tier capital 
the maximum amount of the allowance for loan and lease losses that qualifies as tier capital is limited to of gross risk weighted assets 
the allowance for loan and lease losses in excess of this limit may  of course  be maintained  but would not be included in a bank s risk based capital calculation 
the federal banking agencies also require all banks to maintain a minimum amount of tier capital to total assets  referred to as the leverage ratio 
for a bank rated in the highest of the five categories used by regulators to rate banks  the minimum leverage ratio of tier capital to total assets is 
for all banks not rated in the highest category  the minimum leverage ratio must be at least to 
these uniform risk based capital guidelines and leverage ratios apply across the industry 
regulators  however  have the discretion to set minimum capital requirements for individual institutions  which may be significantly above the minimum guidelines and ratios 
other factors affecting minimum capital standards the federal banking agencies have established certain benchmark ratios of loan loss reserves to be held against classified assets 
the benchmark by federal banking agencies is the sum of of assets classified loss of assets classified doubtful of assets classified substandard and estimated credit losses on other assets over the upcoming months the federal risk based capital rules adopted by banking agencies take into account bank s concentrations of credit and the risks of engaging in non traditional activities 
concentrations of credit refers to situations where a lender has a relatively large proportion of loans involving a single borrower  industry  geographic location  collateral or loan type 
non traditional activities are considered those that have not customarily been part of the banking business  but are conducted by a bank as a result of developments in  for example  technology  financial markets or other additional activities permitted by law or regulation 
the regulations require institutions with high or inordinate levels of risk to operate with higher minimum capital standards 
the federal banking agencies also are authorized to review an institution s management of concentrations of credit risk for adequacy and consistency with safety and soundness standards regarding internal controls  credit underwriting or other operational and managerial areas 
the federal banking agencies also limit the amount of deferred tax assets that are allowable in computing a bank s regulatory capital 
deferred tax assets that can be realized for taxes paid in prior carryback years and from future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences are generally not limited 
however  deferred tax assets that can only be realized through future taxable earnings are limited for regulatory capital purposes to the lesser of the amount that can be realized within one year of the quarter end report date  or of tier capital the amount of any deferred tax in excess of this limit would be excluded from tier capital  total assets and regulatory capital calculations 
the federal banking agencies have also adopted a joint agency policy statement that provides that the adequacy and effectiveness of a bank s interest rate risk management process and the level of its interest rate exposure is a critical factor in the evaluation of the bank s capital adequacy 
a bank with material weaknesses in its interest rate risk management process or high levels of interest rate exposure relative to its capital will be directed by the federal banking agencies to take corrective actions 
financial institutions which have significant amounts of their assets concentrated in high risk loans or nontraditional banking activities  and who fail to adequately manage these risks  may be required to set aside capital in excess of the regulatory minimums 
prompt corrective action the federal banking agencies possess broad powers to take prompt corrective action pca to resolve the problems of insured banks 
each federal banking agency has issued regulations defining five capital categories well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized 
under the regulations  a bank shall be deemed to be well capitalized if it has a total risk based capital ratio of or more  has a tier risk based capital ratio of or more  has a leverage capital ratio of or more and is not subject to specified requirements to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure adequately capitalized if it has a total risk based capital ratio of or more  a tier risk based capital ratio of or more and a leverage capital ratio of or more under certain circumstances and does not meet the definition of well capitalized undercapitalized if it has a total risk based capital ratio that is less than  a tier risk based capital ratio that is less than  or a leverage capital ratio that is less than under certain circumstances significantly undercapitalized if it has a total risk based capital ratio that is less than  a tier risk based capital ratio that is less than or a leverage capital ratio that is less than  and critically undercapitalized if it has a ratio of tangible equity to total assets that is equal to or less than banks are prohibited from paying dividends or management fees to controlling persons or entities if  after making the payment  the bank would be undercapitalized  that is  the bank fails to meet the required minimum level for any relevant capital measure 
asset growth and branching restrictions apply to undercapitalized banks 
banks classified as undercapitalized are required to submit acceptable capital plans guaranteed by its holding company  if any 
broad regulatory authority was granted with respect to significantly undercapitalized banks  including forced mergers  growth restrictions  ordering new elections for directors  forcing divestiture by its holding company  if any  requiring management changes and prohibiting the payment of bonuses to senior management 
even more severe restrictions are applicable to critically undercapitalized banks  those with capital at or less than 
restrictions for these banks include the appointment of a receiver or conservator after days  even if the bank is still solvent 
all of the federal banking agencies have promulgated substantially similar regulations to implement this system of pca 
a bank  based upon its capital levels  that is classified as well capitalized  adequately capitalized or undercapitalized may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if the appropriate federal banking agency  after notice and opportunity for hearing  determines that an unsafe or unsound condition  or an unsafe or unsound practice  warrants such treatment 
at each successive lower capital category  an insured bank is subject to more restrictions 
the federal banking agencies  however  may not treat an institution as critically undercapitalized unless its capital ratios actually warrant such treatment 
deposit insurance assessments the fdic has implemented a risk based assessment system in which the deposit insurance premium relates to the probability that the deposit insurance fund will incur a loss 
the fdic sets semi annual assessments in an amount necessary to maintain or increase the reserve ratio of the insurance fund to at least of insured deposits or a higher percentage as determined to be justified by the fdic 
under the risk based assessment system adopted by the fdic  banks are categorized into one of three capital categories  well capitalized  adequately capitalized and undercapitalized 
assignment of a bank into a particular capital category is based on supervisory evaluations by its primary federal regulator 
after being assigned to a particular capital category  a bank is classified into one of three supervisory categories 
the three supervisory categories are group a financially sound with only a few minor weaknesses group b demonstrates weaknesses that could result in significant deterioration group c poses a substantial probability of loss the capital ratios used by the fdic to define well capitalized  adequately capitalized and undercapitalized are the same as in the prompt corrective action regulations 
the assessment rates are summarized below  expressed in terms of cents per in insured deposits assessment rates supervisory group capital group group a group b group c well capitalized adequately capitalized undercapitalized gnb is currently risk rated a b  which translates to well capitalized  group b 
interstate banking and branching bank holding companies from any state may generally acquire banks and bank holding companies located in any other state  subject in some cases to nationwide and state imposed deposit concentration limits and limits on the acquisition of recently established banks 
banks also have the ability  subject to specific restrictions  to acquire by acquisition or merger branches located outside their home state 
the establishment of interstate branches is also possible in those states with laws that expressly permit it 
interstate branches are subject to many of the laws of the states in which they are located 
california law authorizes out of state banks to enter california by the acquisition of  or merger with  a california bank that has been in existence for at least five years  unless the california bank is in danger of failing or in certain other emergency situations 
interstate branching into california is  however  limited to the acquisition of an existing bank 
enforcement powers in addition to measures taken under the pca provisions  insured banks may be subject to potential enforcement actions by the federal regulators for unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their businesses  or for violation of any law  rule  regulation or condition imposed in writing by the regulatory agency or term of a written agreement with the regulatory agency 
enforcement actions may include the appointment of a conservator or receiver for the bank the issuance of a cease and desist order that can be judicially enforced the termination of the bank s deposit insurance the imposition of civil monetary penalties  the issuance of directives to increase capital  the issuance of formal and informal agreements the issuance of removal and prohibition orders against officers  directors and other institution affiliated parties the enforcement of such actions through injunctions or restraining orders based upon a judicial determination that the deposit insurance fund or the bank would be harmed if such equitable relief was not granted safety and soundness guidelines the federal banking agencies have adopted guidelines to assist in identifying and addressing potential safety and soundness concerns before capital becomes impaired 
these guidelines establish operational and managerial standards relating to internal controls  information systems and internal audit systems loan documentation credit underwriting asset growth compensation  fees and benefits additionally  the federal banking agencies have adopted safety and soundness guidelines for asset quality and for evaluating and monitoring earnings to ensure that earnings are sufficient for the maintenance of adequate capital and reserves 
if an institution fails to comply with a safety and soundness standard  the appropriate federal banking agency may require the institution to submit a compliance plan 
failure to submit a compliance plan or to implement an accepted plan may result in a formal enforcement action 
the federal banking agencies have issued regulations prescribing uniform guidelines for real estate lending 
the regulations require insured depository institutions to adopt written policies establishing standards  consistent with such guidelines  for extensions of credit secured by real estate 
the policies must address loan portfolio management  underwriting standards and loan to value limits that do not exceed the supervisory limits prescribed by the regulations 
consumer protection laws and regulations the bank regulatory agencies are focusing greater attention on compliance with consumer protection laws and their implementing regulations 
examination and enforcement have become more intense in nature and insured institutions have been advised to carefully monitor compliance with various consumer protection laws and their implementing regulations 
banks are subject to many federal consumer protection laws and their regulations  including community reinvestment act cra truth in lending act tila fair housing act fh act equal credit opportunity act ecoa home mortgage disclosure act hmda real estate settlement procedures act respa gramm leach bliley act cra is intended to encourage insured depository institutions  while operating safely and soundly  to help meet the credit needs of their communities 
cra specifically directs the federal bank regulatory agencies  in examining insured depository institutions  to assess their record of helping to meet the credit needs of their entire community  including low and moderate income neighborhoods  consistent with safe and sound banking practices 
cra further requires the agencies to take a financial institution s record of meeting its community credit needs into account when evaluating applications for  among other things  domestic branches  consummating mergers or acquisitions or holding company formations 
the federal banking agencies have adopted regulations that measure a bank s compliance with its cra obligations on a performance based evaluation system 
this system bases cra ratings on an institution s actual lending service and investment performance rather than the extent to which the institution conducts needs assessments  documents community outreach or complies with other procedural requirements 
the ratings range from a high of outstanding to a low of substantial noncompliance 
ecoa prohibits discrimination in any credit transaction  whether for consumer or business purposes  on the basis of race  color  religion  national origin  sex  marital status  age except in limited circumstances  receipt of income from public assistance programs or good faith exercise of any rights under the consumer credit protection act 
the federal interagency task force on fair lending issued a policy statement on discrimination in lending 
the policy statement describes the three methods that federal agencies will use to prove discrimination overt evidence of discrimination evidence of disparate treatment evidence of disparate impact if a creditor s actions have had the effect of discriminating  the creditor may be held liable even when there is no intent to discriminate 
fh act regulates many practices  including making it unlawful for any lender to discriminate against any person in its housing related lending activities because of race  color  religion  national origin  sex  handicap or familial status 
fh act is broadly written and has been broadly interpreted by the courts 
a number of lending practices have been found to be  or may be considered  illegal under fh act  including some that are not specifically mentioned in fh act itself 
among those practices that have been found to be  or may be considered  illegal under fh act are declining a loan for the purposes of racial discrimination making excessively low appraisals of property based on racial considerations pressuring  discouraging or denying applications for credit on a prohibited basis using excessively burdensome qualifications standards for the purpose or with the effect of denying housing to minority applicants imposing on minority loan applicants more onerous interest rates or other terms  conditions or requirements racial steering or deliberately guiding potential purchasers to or away from certain areas because of race tila is designed to ensure that credit terms are disclosed in a meaningful way so that consumers may compare credit terms more readily and knowledgeably 
as a result of tila  all creditors must use the same credit terminology and expressions of rates  the annual percentage rate  the finance charge  the amount financed  the total payments and the payment schedule 
hmda grew out of public concern over credit shortages in certain urban neighborhoods 
one purpose of hmda is to provide public information that will help show whether financial institutions are serving the housing credit needs of the neighborhoods and communities in which they are located 
hmda also includes a fair lending aspect that requires the collection and disclosure of data about applicant and borrower characteristics as a way of identifying possible discriminatory lending patterns and enforcing anti discrimination statutes 
hmda requires institutions to report data regarding applications for one to four family real estate loans  home improvement loans and multifamily loans  as well as information concerning originations and purchases of those types of loans 
federal bank regulators rely  in part  upon data provided under hmda to determine whether depository institutions engage in discriminatory lending practices 
respa requires lenders to provide borrowers with disclosures regarding the nature and costs of real estate settlements 
also  respa prohibits certain abusive practices  such as kickbacks  and places limitations on the amount of escrow accounts 
glb required disclosure of the bank s privacy policy at the time the customer relationship is established and annually thereafter 
under the provisions of glb  financial institutions must put systems in place to safeguard the non public personal information of its customers 
violations of these various consumer protection laws and regulations can result in civil liability to the aggrieved party  regulatory enforcement including civil money penalties and even punitive damages 
other aspects of banking law gnb is also subject to federal and state statutory and regulatory provisions covering  among other things  security procedures  currency and foreign transactions reporting  insider and affiliated party transactions  management interlocks  electronic funds transfers  funds availability and truth in savings 
there are also a variety of federal statutes that regulate acquisitions of control and the formation of bank holding companies 
impact of monetary policies banking is a business that depends on rate differentials 
in general  the difference between the interest rate paid by a bank on its deposits and its other borrowings and the interest rate earned on its loans  securities and other interest earning assets comprises the major source of gnb s earnings 
these rates are highly sensitive to many factors which are beyond gnb s control and  accordingly  the earnings and growth of gnb are subject to the influence of economic conditions generally  both domestic and foreign  including inflation  recession and unemployment and also to the influence of monetary and fiscal policies of the united states and its agencies  particularly the frb 
the frb implements national monetary policy  such as seeking to curb inflation and combat recession  by open market dealings in us government securities adjusting the required level of reserves for financial institutions subject to reserve requirements placing limitations upon savings and time deposit interest rates adjusting the discount rate applicable to borrowings by banks which are members of the frb the actions of the frb in these areas influence the growth of bank loans  investments and deposits and also affect interest rates 
since january  the frb has decreased interest rates numerous times 
the nature and timing of any future changes in the frb s policies and their impact on the company and gnb cannot be predicted  however  depending on the degree to which our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities are rate sensitive  increases in rates would have a temporary effect of increasing our net interest margin  while decreases in interest rates would have the opposite effect 
in addition  adverse economic conditions could make a higher provision for loan losses a prudent course and could cause higher loan charge offs  thus adversely affecting our net income or other operating costs 
see interest rate risk page critical accounting policies the company s accounting policies are more fully described in note of the consolidated financial statements 
as disclosed in note  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 
the company believes that the following discussion addresses the company s most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments 
provision and allowance for loan losses the company maintains a detailed  systematic analysis and procedural discipline to determine the amount of the allowance for loan losses all 
the all is based on estimates and is intended to be adequate to provide for probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
this process involves deriving probable loss estimates that are based on individual loan loss estimation  migration analysis historical loss rates and management s judgment 
the company employs several methodologies for estimating probable losses 
methodologies are determined based on a number of factors  including type of asset  risk rating  concentrations  collateral value and the input of the special assets group  functioning as a workout unit 
the all calculation for the different major loan types is as follows sba all loans are reviewed and classified loans are assigned a specific allowance 
those not assigned to a watch list category are classified as pass 
a migration analysis is then used to calculate the required allowance on those pass loans 
relationship banking includes commercial and real estate mortgage loans originated by the two branch locations 
classified loans are assigned a specific allowance 
a migration analysis is then used to calculate the required allowance on the remaining pass loans 
manufactured housing an allowance is prudently calculated on the basis of risk rating  which is a combination of delinquency  value of collateral on classified loans and perceived risk in the product line 
securitized loans the company considers this a homogeneous portfolio and calculates the allowance based on statistical information provided by the servicer 
charge off history is calculated based on three methodologies  a month and a month historical trend and by delinquency information 
the highest requirement of the three methods is used 
management reviews the all on a monthly basis and records an adjustment as deemed necessary 
the review of the adequacy of the allowance takes into consideration such factors as changes in the growth  size and composition of the loan portfolio  overall portfolio quality  review of specific problem loans  collateral  guarantees and economic conditions that may affect the borrowers ability to pay and and or the value of the underlying collateral 
these estimates depend on the outcome of future events and  therefore  contain inherent uncertainties 
the company s all is maintained at a level believed adequate by management to absorb known and inherent probable losses on existing loans 
a provision for loan losses is charged to expense 
the allowance is charged for losses when management believes that full recovery on the loan is unlikely 
generally  the company charges off any loan classified as a loss  portions of loans which are deemed to be uncollectible  overdrafts which have been outstanding for more than days  and  all other unsecured loans past due or more days 
subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the all 
interest only strips and servicing assets the company originates certain loans for the purpose of selling either a portion of  or the entire loan  into the secondary market 
sba loans can be sold into the secondary market 
servicing assets are recognized as separate assets when loans are sold with servicing retained 
servicing assets are amortized in proportion to  and over the period of  estimated future net servicing income 
also  at the time of the loan sale  it is the company s policy to recognize the related gain on the loan sale in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the company uses its prepayment experience and industry statistics in estimating the expected life of the loans 
quarterly  management evaluates servicing assets for impairment 
servicing assets are evaluated for impairment based on the fair value of the rights as compared to amortized cost on a loan by loan basis 
fair value is determined using discounted future cash flows calculated on a loan by loan basis and aggregated to the total asset level 
impairment to the asset is recorded if the aggregate fair value calculation drops below net book value of the asset 
additionally  on certain sba loan sales  the company has retained interest only i o strips  which represent the present value of excess net cash flows generated by the difference between a interest at the stated rate paid by borrowers and b the sum of i pass through interest paid to third party investors and ii contractual servicing fees 
prior to april   the company determined the present value of this estimated cash flow at the time each loan sale transaction closed  utilizing valuation assumptions as to discount rate  prepayment rate and default rate appropriate for each particular transaction 
for loans sold after march   the initial servicing assets and resulting gain on sale were calculated based on the difference between the best actual par and premium bids on an individual loan basis 
this same methodology would apply to the initial valuation of any new i o strip assets 
as the company did not sell any loans for par during  there were no additions to the i o strips using the new assumptions 
periodically  the company verifies the reasonableness of its valuation estimates by comparison to the results of an independent third party valuation analysis 
the i o strips are classified as trading securities 
accordingly  the company records the i o s strips at fair value with the resulting increase or decrease in fair value being recorded through operations in the current period 
for the years ended december   and  net decreases in fair value of   and  respectively  are included in the income statement as reductions to loan servicing income 
securitized loans and bonds payable in and  respectively  the company transferred million and million in loans to special purpose trusts trusts 
the transfers have been accounted for as secured borrowings with a pledge of collateral and  accordingly  the mortgage loans and related bonds issued are included on the company s balance sheet 
such loans are accounted for in the same manner as loans held to maturity 
deferred debt issuance costs and bond discount related to the bonds are amortized on a method that approximates the level yield basis over the estimated life of the bonds 
other real estate owned and impaired loans the fair value of other real estate owned or collateral supporting impaired loans is determined from appraisals obtained from independent appraisers 
the company must also estimate the costs to dispose of the property 
this is generally done based on experience with similar properties 
subsequent to foreclosure  management periodically performs a new valuation and the asset is carried at the lower of carrying amount or fair value 
operating expenses or income  and gains or losses on disposition of such properties  are charged to current operations 
stock options when the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  it elected to continue to use the method of accounting for stock options that did not require recognition of compensation expense at the time options are granted 
instead  as required by sfas  pro forma amounts of compensation expense and the pro forma impact on net income and earnings per share are disclosed each year as if the company had recognized compensation expense 
the pro forma compensation expense is calculated using the black scholes model for pricing 
for the year  the alternative method of accounting for stock options would have reduced net income by  or 
per share  fully diluted 
new accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
which addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities vies either that do not have sufficient equity investment at risk to permit the entity to refinance its activities without additional subordinated financial support  or in which the equity investors lack an essential characteristic of a controlling financial interest 
in december  fasb completed deliberations of proposed modifications to fin revised interpretations resulting in multiple effective dates based on the nature as well as the creation date of the vie 
vies created after january   but prior to january   may be accounted for either based on the original interpretation or the revised interpretations 
however  the revised interpretations must be applied no later than the first quarter of fiscal year the adoption of fin as revised is not anticipated to have an impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
fin changed current practice in the accounting for  and disclosure of  guarantees 
guarantees meeting the characteristics described and not included in a long list of exceptions are required to be initially recorded at fair value  which is different from the general current practice of recording a liability only when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable  as those terms are defined in fasb statement no 
 accounting for contingencies 
fin also requires a guarantor to make significant new disclosures for virtually all guarantees 
fin disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ended after december   while the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  and existing guarantees for the interim period beginning july  management does not believe that the impact of the adoption of this pronouncement will have a material impact on the company or its financial statements 
regulatory matters from october until october  gnb was operating under a consent order with the occ 
in addition  from march until november  the company was operating under a memorandum of understanding with the frb 
under these agreements  both gnb and the company were precluded from certain activities 
among other things  the company will now be able to pay dividends without prior approval from the frb  gnb is no longer subject to specialr risk based capital guidelines  gnb may now pursue new products without prior approval of the occ  gnb may accept broker deposits and is no longer subject to interest rate caps on deposits 
also  the termination of these agreements will result in certain expense savings

all material intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated 
the following are descriptions of the most significant of those policies nature of operations the company s primary operations are related to commercial banking and financial services through gnb which include the acceptance of deposits and the lending and investing of money 
the company also engages in electronic banking services 
the company s customers consist of small to mid sized businesses  as well as individuals 
the company also originates and sells u 
s 
small business administration sba and first and second mortgage loans through its normal operations and loan production offices 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities as well as disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
these estimates and assumptions also affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
although management believes these estimates to be reasonably accurate  actual results may differ 
certain amounts in the and financial statements have been reclassified to be comparable with classifications in the business segments reportable business segments are determined using the management approach and are intended to present reportable segments consistent with how the chief operating decision maker organizes segments within the company for making operating decisions and assessing performance 
as of december  and  the company had only one reportable business segment 
reserve requirements all depository institutions are required by law to maintain reserves on transaction accounts and non personal time deposits in the form of cash balances at the federal reserve bank frb 
these reserve requirements can be offset by cash balances held at gnb 
at december  and  gnb s cash balance was sufficient to offset the frb requirement 
investment securities the company currently holds securities classified as both available for sale afs and held to maturity htm 
securities classified as htm are accounted for at amortized cost as the company has the positive intent and ability to hold them to maturity 
securities not classified as htm are considered afs and are carried at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of any applicable income taxes 
realized gains or losses on the sale of afs securities  if any  are determined on a specific identification basis 
purchase premiums and discounts are recognized in interest income using the effective interest method over the terms of the related securities  or to earlier call dates  if appropriate 
declines in the fair value of afs or htm securities below their cost that are deemed to be other than temporary  if any  are reflected in earnings as realized losses 
there is no recognition of unrealized gains or losses for htm securities 
interest only strips and servicing assets the guaranteed portion of certain sba loans can be sold into the secondary market 
servicing assets are recognized as separate assets when loans are sold with servicing retained 
servicing assets are amortized in proportion to  and over the period of  estimated future net servicing income 
also  at the time of the loan sale  it is the company s policy to recognize the related gain on the loan sale in accordance with gaap 
the company uses industry prepayment statistics and its own prepayment experience in estimating the expected life of the loans 
management periodically evaluates servicing assets for impairment 
servicing assets are evaluated for impairment based upon the fair value of the rights as compared to amortized cost on a loan by loan basis 
fair value is determined using discounted future cash flows calculated on a loan by loan basis and aggregated to the total asset level 
impairment to the asset is recorded if the aggregate fair value calculation drops below net book value of the asset 
additionally  on certain sba loan sales  the company has retained interest only i o strips  which represent the present value of excess net cash flows generated by the difference between a interest at the stated rate paid by borrowers and b the sum of i pass through interest paid to third party investors and ii contractual servicing fees 
prior to april   the company determined the present value of this estimated cash flow at the time each loan sale transaction closed  utilizing valuation assumptions as to discount rate  prepayment rate and default rate f appropriate for each particular transaction 
for loans sold after march   the initial servicing assets and resulting gain on sale were calculated based on the difference between the best actual par and premium bids on an individual loan basis 
this same methodology would apply to the initial valuation of any new i o strip assets 
as the company did not sell any loans for par during  there were no additions to the i o strips using the new assumptions 
periodically  the company verifies the reasonableness of its valuation estimates by comparison to the results of an independent third party valuation analysis 
the i o strips are classified as trading securities 
accordingly  the company records the i o s strips at fair value with the resulting increase or decrease in fair value being recorded through operations in the current period 
for the years ended december   and  net decreases in fair value of   and  respectively  are included in the income statement as reductions to loan servicing income 
loans held for sale loans which are originated and intended for sale in the secondary market are carried at the lower of cost or estimated fair value determined on an aggregate basis 
valuation adjustments  if any  are recognized through a valuation allowance by charges to lower of cost or market provision 
loans held for sale are primarily comprised of sba loans  second mortgage loans and residential mortgage loans 
for the year ended december   the company recorded a lower of cost or market provision of  the company did not incur a lower of cost or market provision in the years ended december  and loans held for investment loans are carried at amounts advanced to the borrowers less the payments collected 
interest on loans is accrued daily on a simple interest basis 
the accrual of interest is discontinued when substantial doubt exists as to collectibility of the loan  generally at the time the loan is days delinquent  unless the credit is well secured and in process of collection 
any unpaid but accrued interest is reversed at that time 
thereafter  interest income is no longer recognized on the loan 
interest on non accrual loans is accounted for on the cash basis or cost recovery method  until qualifying for return to accrual 
loans are returned to accrual status when all of the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured 
impaired loans are identified as impaired when it is probable that interest and principal will not be collected according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
all of the company s nonaccrual loans were also classified as impaired at december  and repurchase agreements securities sold under repurchase agreements are treated as collateralized financing transactions and carried at the amount at which the securities will be subsequently repurchased securitized loans and bonds payable in and  respectively  the company transferred million and million in loans to special purpose trusts trusts 
the transfers have been accounted for as secured borrowings and  accordingly  the mortgage loans and related bonds issued are included in the company s balance sheet 
such loans are accounted for in the same manner as loans held to maturity 
deferred debt issuance costs and bond discount related to the bonds are amortized on a method that approximates the level yield method over the estimated life of the bonds 
loan fees and costs loan origination fees  certain direct origination costs and purchase premiums and discounts are deferred and recognized as an adjustment to the loan yield over the life of the loan using the level yield method 
allowance for loan losses the company maintains a detailed  systematic analysis and procedural discipline to determine the amount of the allowance for loan losses all 
the all is based on estimates and is intended to be adequate to provide for probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
this process involves deriving probable loss estimates that are based on individual loan loss estimation  migration analysis historical loss rates and management s judgment 
the company employs several methodologies for estimating probable losses 
methodologies are determined based on a number of factors  including type of asset  risk rating  concentrations  collateral value and the input of the special assets group  functioning as a workout unit 
other real estate owned other real estate owned oreo is real estate acquired through foreclosure on the collateral property and is recorded at fair value at the time of foreclosure less estimated costs to sell 
any excess of loan balance over the fair value of the oreo is charged off against the allowance for loan losses 
subsequent to foreclosure  management periodically performs a new valuation and the asset is carried at the lower of carrying amount or fair value 
operating expenses or income  and gains or losses on disposition of such properties  are charged to current operations 
premises and equipment premises and equipment are stated at cost  less accumulated depreciation and amortization 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the terms of the leases or the estimated useful lives of the improvements  whichever is shorter 
generally  the estimated useful lives of other items of premises and equipment are as follows f building and improvements years furniture and equipment years electronic equipment and software years income taxes deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax effect of differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each period end based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
a valuation allowance is established for deferred tax assets if  based on weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets may not be realized 
income loss per share basic income loss per share is computed based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding during each year divided into net income loss 
diluted income per share is computed based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding during each year plus the dilutive effect  if any  of outstanding options divided into net income loss 
statement of cash flows for purposes of reporting cash flows  cash and cash equivalents include cash  due from banks  interest earning deposits in other financial institutions and federal funds sold 
federal funds sold are one day transactions with gnb s funds being returned the following business day 
stock based compensation gaap permits the company to use either of two methodologies to account for compensation cost in connection with employee stock options 
the first method requires issuers to record compensation expense over the period the options are expected to be outstanding prior to exercise  expiration or cancellation 
the amount of compensation expense to be recognized over this term is the fair value of the options at the time of the grant as determined by the black scholes valuation model 
black scholes computes fair value of the options based on the length of their term  the volatility of the stock price in past periods and other factors 
under this method  the issuer recognizes compensation expense regardless of whether or not the employee eventually exercises the options 
under the second methodology  if options are granted at an exercise price equal to the market value of the stock at the time of the grant  no compensation expense is recognized 
the company believes that this method better reflects the motivation for its issuance of stock options  as they are intended as incentives for future performance rather than compensation for past performance 
gaap requires that issuers electing the second method must present pro forma disclosure of net income loss and earnings per share as if the first method had been elected 
under the terms of the company s stock option plan  full time salaried employees may be granted qualified stock options or incentive stock options and directors may be granted nonqualified stock options 
options may be granted at a price not less than of the market value of the stock on the date of grant 
qualified options are generally exercisable in cumulative installments 
all options expire no later than ten years from the date of grant 
as of december   options were outstanding at prices ranging from to per share with  options exercisable and  options available for future grant

loan sales and servicing sba loan sales the company sells the guaranteed portion of selected sba loans into the secondary market  on a servicing retained basis  in exchange for a combination of a cash premium  servicing assets and or i o strips 
the company retains the unguaranteed portion of these loans and services the loans as required under the sba programs to retain specified yield amounts 
the sba program stipulates that the company retain a minimum of of the unguranteed portion of the loan balance 
the percentage of each unguaranteed loan in excess of can be periodically sold to a third party for a cash premium 
a portion of the yield is recognized as servicing fee income as it occurs and the remainder is capitalized as excess servicing and is included in the gain on sale calculation 
the fair value of the i o strips and servicing assets prior to april  was determined using a discount rate based on the term of the underlying loan instrument and a prepayment rate 
for loans sold after march   the initial values of the servicing assets and resulting gain on sale were calculated based on the difference between the best actual par and premium bids received for each individual loan

securitized loans the company originated and purchased second mortgage loans that allowed borrowers to borrow up to of their home s appraised value  when combined with the balance of the first mortgage loan  up to a maximum loan of  in and  the company transferred million and million  respectively  of these loans to two special purpose trusts 
these loans were both originated and purchased by the company 
the trusts  then sold bonds to third party investors that were secured by the transferred loans 
the loans and bonds are held in the trusts independent of the company  the trustee of which oversees the distributions to the bondholders 
the mortgage loans are serviced by a third party servicer  who receives a stated servicing fee 
there is an insurance policy on the bonds that guarantees the payment of the bonds 
the company did not surrender effective control over the loans transferred at the time of securitization 
accordingly  the securitizations are accounted for as secured borrowings and both the loans and bonds in the trusts are consolidated into the financial statements of the company

fair values of financial instruments the estimated fair values of financial instruments have been determined by the company using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies 
however  considerable judgment is required to interpret market data to develop estimates of fair value 
accordingly  the estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the company could realize in a current market exchange 
the use of different market assumptions and or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts

time deposits in other financial institutions the carrying amounts approximate fair value because of the relative short term nature of these instruments 
federal reserve stock the carrying value approximates the fair value because the stock can be sold back to the federal reserve at anytime 
investment securities the fair value is based on quoted market prices from security brokers or dealers 
interest only strips the fair value of the interest only strips has been determined by the discounted cash flow method  using market discount and prepayment rates 
loans the fair value of loans is estimated for portfolios of loans with similar financial characteristics  primarily fixed and adjustable rate interest terms 
the fair value of fixed rate mortgage loans is based upon discounted cash flows utilizing the rate that the company currently offers as well as anticipated prepayment schedules 
the fair value of adjustable rate loans is also based upon discounted cash flows utilizing discount rates that the company currently offers  as well as anticipated prepayment schedules 
servicing assets fair value is determined using discounted future cash flows calculated on a loan by loan basis and aggregated to the total asset level 
deposits the fair values of deposits are estimated based upon the type of deposit products 
demand accounts  which include savings and transaction accounts  are presumed to have equal book and fair values  since the interest rates paid on these accounts are based on prevailing market rates 
the estimated fair values of time deposits are determined by discounting the cash flows of segments of deposits that have similar maturities and rates  utilizing a yield curve that approximates the prevailing rates offered to depositors as of the measurement date 
f securities sold under agreements to repurchase the fair value is estimated using discounted cash flow analysis based on rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements 
bonds payable the fair value is estimated using discounted cash flow analysis based on rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements 
commitments to extend credit  commercial and standby letters of credit due to the proximity of the pricing of these commitments to the period end  the fair values of commitments are immaterial to the financial statements 
the fair value estimates presented herein are based on pertinent information available to management as of december  and although management is not aware of any factors that would significantly affect the estimated fair value amounts  such amounts have not been comprehensively revalued for purposes of these financial statements since those dates and  therefore  current estimates of fair value may differ significantly from the amounts presented herein 
regulatory matters the company on a consolidated basis and gnb are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that  if undertaken  could have a direct material effect on the company s and gnb s financial statements 
under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  the company and gnb must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the company s and gnb s assets  liabilities and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
the company s and gnb s capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components  risk weightings and other factors 
prompt corrective action provisions are not applicable to bank holding companies 
the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act fdicia contains rules as to the legal and regulatory environment for insured depository institutions  including reductions in insurance coverage for certain kinds of deposits  increased supervision by the federal regulatory agencies  increased reporting requirements for insured institutions and new regulations concerning internal controls  accounting and operations 
the prompt corrective action regulations of fdicia define specific capital categories based on the institutions capital ratios 
the capital categories  in declining order  are well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized 
to be considered well capitalized  an institution must have a core capital ratio of at least and a total risk based capital ratio of at least 
additionally  fdicia imposes tier i risk based capital ratio of at least to be considered well capitalized 
tier i risk based capital is  primarily  common stock and retained earnings  net of goodwill and other intangible assets 
quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the company and the bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios set forth in the following table of total and tier capital as defined in the regulations to risk weighted assets as defined and of tier capital as defined to average assets as defined

commitments and contingencies commitments in the normal course of business  the company is a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk to meet the financing needs of its customers 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby f letters of credit 
these instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet 
the company s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual notional amount of those instruments 
as of december  and  the company had commitments to extend credit of approximately million and million  respectively  including obligations to extend standby letters of credit of approximately  and  respectively 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
those guarantees are primarily issued to support private borrowing arrangements 
all guarantees are short term and expire within one year 
the company uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for extending loan facilities to customers 
the company evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on a case by case basis 
the amount of collateral obtained  if deemed necessary by the company upon extension of credit  is based on management s credit evaluation of the counterparty

management believes that the company is in compliance with these requirements 
the outstanding balance of the sold portion of such loans was approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
the company retains a substantial degree of risk relating to the servicing activities and retained interest in sold sba loans 
in addition  during the period of time that the loans are held for sale  the company is subject to various business risks associated with the lending business  including borrower default  foreclosure and the risk that a rapid increase in interest rates would result in a decline of the value of loans held for sale to potential purchasers 
in connection with its loan sales  the company enters agreements which generally require the company to repurchase or substitute loans in the event of a breach of a representation or warranty made by the company to the loan purchaser  any misrepresentation during the mortgage loan origination process or  in some cases  upon any fraud or early default on such mortgage loans
