item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview after the disposal of the investment subsidiary on october   as discussed below  the only business of the company is the apparel business 
the business is conducted through two wholly owned subsidiaries hampshire designers  which primarily designs and sells women s and men s sweaters  and item eyes  which designs and sells a broad line of women s woven and knit separates 
the company sells to approximately retail customers  primarily in the united states  including most major department stores  mass merchants  specialty retail stores and catalog companies 
the company s three major customers  each representing more than of sales  are jcpenney company  kohl s corporation and may department stores 
the company outsources the manufacture of its products  principally due to lower labor costs available through the company s international sources 
substantially all of the products sold by the company  including the products sold by item eyes  are supplied by international manufacturing sources 
women s sweaters are marketed under the company s own labels  designers originals and designers originals studio  licensed labels and private labels of its customers 
the company historically produced and marketed a classic styled sweater  however  demand has shifted over the past several years with the majority of growth occurring in fashion design and embellished sweaters and tops that can only be sourced internationally due to the extensive hand labor required to manufacture such garments 
sales of women s sweaters  including sweaters marketed by item eyes  accounted for approximately of the company s net sales in men s sweaters  accounting for approximately of net sales of the company in  are primarily manufactured through the company s international sources 
the products are marketed under company owned labels spring mercer and mercer street studio and under well known designer s labels including geoffrey beene  dockers and levi s 
during  the market demand for men s sweaters declined approximately from management believes this decline reflects the industry wide conditions which will reverse itself in the future 
item eyes produces only women s products 
the trend in product mix for item eyes over the past three years has been a decrease in the demand for blazers  which has been offset by an almost equal increase in the sale of sweaters 
in blazers represented approximately of item eyes net sales while the sweater category was insignificant 
sales of blazers by item eyes during decreased to less than of annual net sales while sweaters accounted for approximately of annual sales 
management believes the demand for blazers will increase as fashion trends change 
the company believes its greatest risk is the uncertainty arising from the scheduled elimination on december  of the quota system established by the world trade organization see discussion under governmental regulation and trade agreements above and the impact that the elimination of the quota system will have on international trade  particularly the apparel industry 
the uncertainty includes any action that may be taken by the united states government in the event that the quantity of imported apparel is determined to be a market disruption in the united states 
the results in were affected by the highly competitive conditions in the retail apparel market 
in the women s sweater business  both sales and earnings increased despite strong competition  but reduced gross margins in the men s sweater business and women s related separates business resulted in a decline in earnings 
the declining margins were in large part due to increased customer allowances  enabling customers to markdown products in the competitive market environment 
customer allowances  including provision for returned product and other adjustments  increased to in from in management analyzed these allowance requests from customers on a case by case basis and grants allowances where deemed important in the long term interest of the company s relationship with its customers 
the company expects pressure on margins to continue throughout as apparel retailers continue to recover from the economic downturn

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis management evaluates its estimates  including those related to the allowance for doubtful accounts  allowances for customer returns and adjustments and  inventory reserves 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form a basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  however  management believes that its estimates  including those for the above described items  are reasonable and that the actual results will not vary significantly from the estimated amounts 
the following critical accounting policies relate to the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements allowances for customer returns and adjustments the company maintains allowances for customer returns  trade discounts  customer chargebacks  and for sales and markdown allowances given to the customer  typically at the end of the selling seasons  which enable customers to markdown the retail sales prices of any remaining goods on hand 
the estimates for these allowances and discounts are based on a number of factors  including historical experience  aging of the trade accounts receivable  specific information obtained by the company on the financial condition and current credit worthiness of customers or other parties  and specific agreements with customers 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate and reduce the ability of the customers to make payments on their accounts  the company may be required to increase its allowances by recording additional bad debt reserves 
further  while the company believes that it has negotiated all substantial sales and markdown allowances with its customers for the season recently completed  additional allowances for the spring season are anticipated and have been provided for 
additional allowances may be requested by customers at the conclusion of the season 
likewise  should the financial condition of the company s customers or other parties improve and result in payments or favorable settlements of previously reserved amounts  the company may be required to record a reduction in recorded allowances 
inventory reserves the company analyzes out of season merchandise on an individual sku basis to determine reserves  if any  that may be required 
factors considered in evaluating the requirement for reserves include product styling  color  current fashion trends and quantities on hand 
many of the company s products are classics and remain saleable from one season to the next and therefore no reserves are generally required on these products 
an estimate is made of the market value  costs to dispose and a normal profit margin  of products whose value is determined to be impaired 
if these products are ultimately sold at less than estimated amounts  additional reserves may be required 
likewise  if these products are sold for more than estimated amounts  reserves may be reduced
