item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our business we design  manufacture and market automated systems for the collection  processing and surgical salvage of donor and patient blood  including the single use disposables used with our systems and related data management software 
our systems allow users to collect and process only the blood component s they target  red blood cells  platelets or plasma  increasing donor and patient safety as well as collection efficiencies 
our systems consist of proprietary disposable sets that operate on our specialized equipment 
our data management systems are used by blood collectors to improve the safety and efficiency of blood collection logistics by eliminating previously manual functions at commercial plasma and not for profit blood banks 
as a general practice we place our equipment at customers sites  with contractual requirements that customers purchase a certain number of disposables in a predetermined time frame 
this disposable revenue stream accounts for about of our total revenues 
during fiscal  we reorganized our business into two global product families donor and patient 
this reorganization redefined our customer and allowed us to expand our customer base to better position us for future growth 
product families our donor products include systems to collect plasma  platelets and red cells from blood donors 
we market our donor products primarily to blood collectors which include both for profit plasma collectors and not for profit blood banks 
our patient products include systems to collect during and after surgery  wash and filter unwanted substances from the blood prior to reinfusion to the surgical patient 
we market these patient products to hospitals and hospital service providers 
miscellaneous and service revenue includes revenue generated from equipment repairs performed under preventive maintenance contracts or emergency service billings  as well as revenue from our software division  fifth dimension d 
donor products plasma o plasma collection systems these systems are used by plasma collectors to collect the plasma component of a donor s whole blood 
the plasma is sold to fractionators for processing into therapeutic pharmaceuticals and vaccines 
automated plasma collection is a safe and cost effective improvement to manual non automated plasma collection which is time consuming  labor intensive  produces relatively poor yields  and poses risk to donors 
currently the vast majority of plasma collections worldwide are automated collections 
blood bank o platelet collection systems these systems are used by blood collectors to collect the platelet component of a donor s whole blood 
platelets are transfused to cancer patients whose platelets have been depleted as a result of chemotherapy 
before the advent of our platelet collection technology  the pooling or combination of platelets from six to eight different donors was necessary to prepare a single therapeutic dose for transfusion to a patient 
our mcs r line of products allows the collection of a sufficient number of platelets from only one donor to produce one or two therapeutic doses 
o cell processing systems these systems are used to freeze  thaw and wash red cells  which enables blood collectors to better manage their red cell inventories 
in a liquid state  red cells must be transfused within days whereas frozen red cells may be stored for up to ten years 
previous generation freezing technology required that red cells be transfused within hours after thawing  our acp r systems allow red cells to be transfused for up to days post thaw 
red cell o these systems are used to automate the collection of red cells from blood donors  improving the blood collector s operational efficiency by increasing the volume of red cells collected per donation event and eliminating manual processing 
just as important  these systems collect twice the volume of red cells than the traditional non automated collection method help blood systems address red cell shortages that commonly plague health care systems 
patient products surgical o surgical blood salvage systems these systems are used by hospitals for the collection of a patient s own blood during or after surgery for reinfusion to the patient  mitigating or eliminating the need for transfusion of donated blood 
we market cell saver r brand systems for higher blood loss procedures such as cardiovascular surgeries and the orthopat r brand system for lower blood loss orthopedic surgeries

net revenues    gross profit    of net revenues operating income    of net revenues provision for income tax    of net revenues net income    of net revenues earnings per share diluted net revenues for fiscal increased over fiscal the favorable effects of foreign exchange contributed of the increase with the remaining resulting from disposable volume increases in our red cell  blood bank and surgical product lines and targeted price increases  partly offset by volume decreases in our plasma product line 
the increase in miscellaneous and service revenue was more than offset by volume decreases in equipment revenue 
revenues for the current year were also positively impacted by the addition of the rd week in our fiscal year  resulting from the policy that we use to determine our fiscal year end 
higher sales  the positive effects of foreign exchange  and cost reductions resulted in a gross profit increase of versus fiscal operating income increased over fiscal due to gross profit improvements from sales increases  foreign exchange  cost reductions  and the net favorable impact resulting from the rd week in our fiscal year  which included both additional revenues and operating expenses 
net income increased as compared to last year 
this increase was a reflection of higher operating income partly offset by the increase in our income tax rate to this year versus last year due to a million tax refund recorded during fiscal market trends plasma market despite the continued increase in demand for plasma derived pharmaceuticals  three significant factors have and are expected to continue to cause volatility in the worldwide commercial plasma collection markets o the commercial plasma industry experienced significant consolidation among plasma collectors and fractionators 
continued consolidation is likely 
industry consolidation impacts us when a collector changes the total number of its collection centers  the total number of collections performed per center or changes the plasma collection system haemonetics or competitive technology used to perform some or all of those collections 
o an oversupply of source plasma has reduced the number of collection procedures performed annually worldwide 
this phenomenon affected us especially in the second half of fiscal year and is expected to continue to affect us in fiscal year however  we believe that the current oversupply of source plasma will be reduced in the next to months  allowing collection activity to return to levels that are consistent with the current demand for the therapeutic pharmaceuticals and vaccines 
o the newer plasma fractionation facilities make more efficient use of plasma in their production processes  utilizing less plasma to make similar quantities of pharmaceuticals and vaccines 
in april of  two of our non exclusive commercial plasma customers merged to form the combined zlb behring 
in may of  zlb behring announced plans to close of its combined collection centers  and to reduce its annual plasma collection volume by approximately one million litres 
zlb behring uses both our systems as well as those of a competitor to collect plasma 
we expect to lose approximately million of revenue that we had planned for zlb behring as a result of these reductions 
our largest us plasma customer  alpha therapeutic corporation alpha was acquired by baxter healthcare corporation baxter  effective october during fiscal year and for the first seven months of fiscal  alpha was our largest us customer of plasma collection disposables 
it had over  plasma collection devices loaned or leased from us 
our sales to alpha were governed by long term purchase and supply contracts that required alpha to purchase plasma collection disposables exclusively from haemonetics and to meet annual minimum purchase obligations for disposable kits  plasma anticoagulant solutions and plasma collection bottles 
the exclusivity provisions of the contracts lapse over time beginning in january and ending in january the minimum purchase requirements of the contracts lapse over time beginning in january and ending in january sales to alpha totaled million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
upon baxter s october  announcement of its acquisition of alpha s business  baxter closed of of the former alpha centers and sold the remaining three centers 
these three centers remain haemonetics customers 
baxter immediately stopped purchasing our plasma collection products disposable bowls  bottles and solutions 
we had no sales to alpha in the fourth quarter of fiscal compared to million in the same quarter last year 
for fiscal  the loss of alpha related revenues will result in decreased revenue in the us of approximately million 
provisions in our supply contracts signed with alpha included protections in case of a change in ownership 
in particular the contracts required that if alpha were sold  the buyer must assume the obligations of the contracts 
on january   we filed a claim for binding arbitration against baxter  seeking an arbitration award that compels baxter to honor its obligations to haemonetics in the contracts it assumed  or to pay us damages 
we have evaluated the likely future use and recoverability of certain disposables inventories and plasma collection devices that supported the alpha business  as well as an intangible asset related to our plasma collection bottle business 
in connection with this evaluation we established reserves of million in fiscal for inventories and devices in accordance with our excess and obsolescence policy 
blood bank market despite moderate increases in the demand for platelets in our major markets  improved collection efficiencies that increase the yield of platelets per collection event have resulted in a flat market for collection disposables 
several factors could affect the future demand for and collection of platelets including o an emerging practice to test platelets for bacteria may result in a need to collect more platelets  as the usable life of platelets collected up to days is generally shortened by up to one day as a result of the bacterial detection process 
the market may also shift towards platelets collected via automation as the test for bacteria would only need to be performed once  as opposed to six to eight times for each whole blood derived platelet collection 
o while the initial interest in pathogen reduction technology has abated there is still interest over a longer horizon in the technology in all regions  particularly japan 
o past outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars in china resulted in the cancellation or delay of elective surgeries and a reduction in willing donors due to concerns about the communication of sars in the region 
a recurrence could result in fewer platelet collections 
red cell market blood shortages  a need for greater operating efficiency  and a stringent regulatory environment continue to drive demand for our red cell product 
there are now two competitive products on the market one from gambro bct and one from baxter 
the baxter product was introduced in may of  but is only now beginning to be placed in the market and there has been little effect on our business from this competitive introduction 
we can not predict what effect competition will have on our business during fiscal year our business continues to grow as we gain new customers and expand our penetration at existing customer sites 
additionally  over the past year our profitability has been increased as more customers have migrated to our filtered disposable sets which support our customers good manufacturing processes by reducing manual processing 
we expect red cell growth to continue in fiscal year surgical market the part of the us surgical blood salvage market that is aimed at higher blood loss procedures is a mature market that is declining and may continue to decline due to improved surgical techniques minimizing blood loss and a decrease in the number of open heart bypass surgeries performed 
as technology improves as seen by the continuous improvements made to coronary stents and angioplasty the preference of surgeons may shift to minimally invasive surgical procedures  reducing the number of open heart surgeries performed 
the main driver of growth for us in this market is the lower blood loss orthopedic procedures served by our orthopat system 
in january  we renewed our agreement with zimmer holdings  inc zimmer  our exclusive us marketing partner which we believe will sustain our position in this market 
we sell the orthopat system direct in our other major markets 
results of operations fiscal as compared to fiscal net revenues by geography april  march  increase increase in thousands decrease decrease united states   international    net revenues    international operations and the impact of foreign exchange our principal operations are in the us  europe  japan and other parts of asia 
our products are marketed in more than countries around the world via a direct sales force as well as independent distributors 
approximately of our revenues during fiscal year were generated outside the us 
revenues in japan accounted for approximately and of total revenues for fiscal and  respectively 
the european region comprised approximately and of our total revenues for fiscal and  respectively 
these sales are primarily conducted in local currencies  specifically the japanese yen and the euro 
accordingly  our results of operations are significantly affected by changes in the value of the yen and the euro relative to the dollar 
the favorable effects of foreign exchange resulted in a increase in sales  greater than of the total increase in sales 
please see section entitled foreign exchange in this management s discussion for a more complete discussion how foreign currency affects our business and our strategy to manage this exposure

the favorable effects of foreign exchange resulted in a increase in revenues  with the remaining increase in revenues resulting primarily from volume increases and to a lesser extent pricing increases and other factors as detailed below 
plasma the favorable effects of foreign exchange resulted in a increase in plasma disposable revenue 
an entirely offsetting decrease in plasma disposables revenue resulted from reduced volumes in most markets  especially in the latter half of the year  most notably the loss of our largest us customer  alpha see market trends section above for a more detailed discussion of the us plasma market  partly offset by increases especially earlier in the year in europe as additional collection centers opened in the second half of fiscal  and volume increases in asia 
the volume increases in asia were due to market share gains as a result of superior quality over the competitive product and a temporary increase in fiscal demand for plasma derivatives as a result of the sars virus 
blood bank the favorable effects of foreign exchange resulted in a increase in blood bank disposable revenues as the majority of our platelet sales occur in europe and japan 
these regions also increased sales as we achieved market share gains due to enhancements to our platelet collection systems and our reputation for quality 
red cell adoption of our technology increased in fiscal as more blood collectors sought to increase the supply of red cells from a declining number of eligible donors  to reduce collection costs  and to improve operating quality and efficiency 
the growth in the us of higher priced filtered sets which include a filter to remove white blood cells from the collected blood also contributed to the revenue increase 
patient surgical the favorable effects of foreign exchange resulted in a increase in surgical disposable revenue 
the remaining increase in surgical disposable revenue of was primarily due to increases in our orthopat disposable products 
orthopat sales increased as us and european orthopedic surgeons continue to adopt surgical blood salvage as an effective alternative to patient pre donation and blood transfusions in hip and knee replacements and other orthopedic surgeries 
we recently announced signing a five year extension to our distribution agreement with zimmer  the distributor of our orthopat product in the us  which positions us for continued growth in this market 
our traditional surgical blood salvage business was down slightly year over year 
see discussion of the reasons for this in the market trends section 
other revenues april  march  increase increase in thousands decrease decrease miscellaneous service    equipment    total other revenues   our miscellaneous and service revenue includes revenue from repairs performed under preventative maintenance contracts or emergency service visits  spare part sales  various training programs and revenue from our software division  d 
miscellaneous and service revenue increased due to foreign exchange 
the remaining increase resulted from several factors  most notably i due to preventative maintenance contract increases in line with the increasing installed base of automated red cell collection devices  and ii due to increased software revenues from d of million 
the decrease in equipment revenue versus fiscal is primarily attributable to three factors i prior year sales of the acp system were positively impacted during its initial rollout to the us military  ii equipment revenue from our platelet collection device in japan was high in the prior year because of a sale to the japanese red cross jrc of equipment used previously by the jrc under a use plan arrangement due to a change in japanese regulatory requirements and iii equipment revenue from the sale of our plasma collection devices to new customers in europe during fiscal was not duplicated in the current fiscal year 
due to the variable nature of equipment sales  the level of equipment sales can not be easily forecasted 
gross profit april  march  increase increase in thousands decrease decrease gross profit    of net sales of the million increase in gross profit  approximately was a result of the favorable effects of currency 
the remaining increase was due primarily to the impact of our higher sales  which included targeted price increases 
other factors impacting our gross profit were offsetting and included million of cost savings from our customer oriented redesign for excellence core program offset by a million increase in our excess and obsolete provision and other cost increases 
operating expenses in thousands april  march  increase increase decrease decrease research and development    selling  general and administrative    total operating expenses    research and development the million decrease in research and development expense is related to lower costs as a result of the personnel reductions see note 
in fiscal  we reviewed our r d projects and plan to prioritize the completion of the development of the cardiopat  a platform for the cardiovascular market  enhancements to our mcs multi component platform for platelet collection and the red cell collector 
the cardiopat is scheduled for limited market release during the second half of fiscal year the mcs platelet collection system enhancements are scheduled for clinical trials by the end of fiscal year we expect ce marking of the red cell collector in the second half of fiscal selling  general and administrative approximately of the million increase in selling  general and administrative is due to foreign exchange 
the other significant components of the increase were million of severance costs recognized in fiscal related to our reorganization which reduced our worldwide workforce by see note and the additional week of expenses in fiscal rd week as compared to fiscal operating income april  march  increase increase in thousands decrease decrease operating income    of net sales the million increase in operating income is primarily a result of improving gross profit from sales increases and cost reductions and lower r d spending partly offset by increased selling  general and administrative expenses due to our recent reorganization 
foreign currency contributed approximately to the year over year improvement 
other income expense  net april  march  increase increase in thousands decrease decrease interest expense   interest income   other income  net   total other income expense  net   interest expense decreased due to lower average debt balances as nearly all of our long term debt is at fixed rates 
interest income decreased million from to  due primarily to lower investment yields on higher average cash investment balances 
other income  net decreased million from fiscal to fiscal due primarily to a million decrease in income earned from points on forward contracts in fiscal points on forward contracts are amounts  either expensed or earned  based on the interest rate differential between two foreign currencies in a forward hedge contract 
taxes the income tax provision  as a percentage of pretax income  was for fiscal and for fiscal the fiscal tax rate reflects a million income tax refund recorded during the third quarter of fiscal at present  we foresee our tax rate remaining at in fiscal fiscal as compared to fiscal net revenues by geography march  march  increase increase in thousands decrease decrease united states    international    net revenues    international operations and the impact of foreign exchange approximately of our revenues during fiscal year were generated outside the us 
revenues in japan accounted for approximately and of total revenues for fiscal and  respectively 
the european region comprised approximately and of our total revenues for fiscal and  respectively 
these sales are primarily conducted in local currencies  specifically the japanese yen and the euro 
accordingly our results of operations are significantly affected by changes in the value of the yen and the euro relative to the dollar 
for fiscal year  foreign exchange resulted in a decrease in sales

an offsetting increase of was attributable to primarily volume related increases in the red cell and plasma product lines plasma plasma disposable sales increases were related to increases in product sold in japan  asia  and europe partially offset by decreases in the us plasma market  which represents half of the market 
the us volume decrease was due to declining sales to one customer in fiscal as a result of industry consolidation 
blood bank foreign exchange resulted in a decrease in blood bank revenues 
the remaining decrease is attributable to reduced sales of our platelet and cell processing disposables 
overall  in fiscal there was a decrease in demand in our platelet markets in the us and europe as compared to fiscal additionally  fiscal year sales related to our acp system disposables were high due to the demand resulting from the events of september  red cell demand for red cell technology increased in the us as customers new and existing reacted to red cell shortages by introducing automation into their collection operations as a means to increase the number of units of blood collected from a declining number of eligible donors 
patient surgical worldwide surgical disposable revenues  including both our traditional cardiovascular surgical blood salvage business and our newer orthopat business  grew modestly 
foreign exchange had no significant impact on these results 
the factors impacting growth include o in the second half of fiscal year  we slowed down the manufacture and sale of orthopat products to our distributor as we implemented a quality enhancement program for the orthopat 
sales of the orthopat product accelerated in the second half of fiscal as we had completed enhancements and sales began to match end user usage 
o we experienced a modest reduction in volume in in our cardiovascular surgical blood salvage business

of this increase  million  or was due to increased software revenues from d 
the increase in equipment revenue versus fiscal is primarily attributable to three factors i fiscal sales of the acp system were positively impacted due to an initial rollout to the us military  ii equipment revenue from our platelet collection device in japan was high in fiscal because of a sale to the japanese red cross jrc of equipment used previously by the jrc under a use plan arrangement due to a change in japanese regulatory requirements and iii equipment revenue from the sale of our plasma collection devices to new customers in europe 
most of our equipment sales occur in markets outside the us in the us we generally place equipment with a customer in exchange for an agreement to purchase disposables or to pay a rental fee 
gross profit march  march  increase increase in thousands decrease decrease gross profit   of net sales the million decrease in gross profit was a result of the negative effects of foreign currency  which were offset by the additional contribution from the increase in sales and cost reductions

operating expenses march  march  increase increase in thousands decrease decrease research and development   selling  general and administrative    acquired research and development   total operating expenses    research and development spending on research and development projects declined slightly in fiscal year these small decreases were offset by increases in expenses reported due to foreign exchange 
selling  general and administrative the increase in spending is related to increases in selling  marketing  and field support expenses to support the higher volumes of sales  a full fiscal year of expenses from d  which we acquired in q of fiscal year  and increases in expenses reported due to foreign exchange 
acquired research and development in the third quarter of fiscal year  we paid baxter million for the right to integrate the new pathogen reduction technology which baxter was developing into our platelet collection devices after the technology receives regulatory approval 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we made an additional million milestone payment to baxter as baxter acquired its initial regulatory approvals in the european market 
because this technology has achieved commercial viability  this payment was capitalized as developed technology  and will be amortized over its useful life 
operating income march  march  increase increase in thousands decrease decrease operating income    of net sales operating income for fiscal year increased million from fiscal year but decreased to of sales in fiscal year from in fiscal year the million increase in operating income was a result of three factors favorably impacting our operations partially offset by two negative factors  as follows the reduction in acquired research and development  revenue driven gross profit improvements  and cost reductions generated by the core program  increased selling  general and administrative spending and the negative effect of foreign currency 
other income expense  net march  march  increase increase in thousands decrease decrease interest expense   interest income    other income  net   total other income  net   interest expense for fiscal year was relatively flat compared to fiscal year nearly all of our long term debt is at fixed rates 
interest income decreased million from to  due primarily to lower average balances of cash invested and lower investment yields 
other income  net increased million from fiscal year to fiscal year due to foreign exchange transaction gains in fiscal year as compared to transaction losses in fiscal year and income recorded to reflect an anticipated payment for a customer contract termination 
these increases in other income were offset in large part by decreases in income earned from points on forward contracts in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year points on forward contracts are amounts  either expensed or earned  based on the interest rate differential between two foreign currencies in a forward hedge contract 
taxes the provision for income tax as a percentage of pretax income was for fiscal year down from for fiscal year the decrease in fiscal year effective tax rate and tax expense resulted from an anticipated income tax refund

critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are summarized in note of our financial statements 
while all of these significant accounting policies impact our financial condition and results of operations  we view certain of these policies as critical 
policies determined to be critical are those policies that have the most significant impact on our financial statements and require management to use a greater degree of judgment and or estimates 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
the accounting policies identified as critical are as follows revenue recognition we recognize revenues in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as outlined in sab no 
which requires that four basic criteria be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  product delivery  including customer acceptance  has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we believe that our revenue recognition policy is critical because revenue is a very significant component of our results of operations 
with our acquisition of fifth dimension information systems  inc fifth dimension in january  we have recorded software sales in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended  and in instances where services are essential to the functionality of the software  which represents the majority of fifth dimensions software sales  revenue is recognized in accordance with sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
in accordance sop  when the services are essential to the functionality of the software  or payment of the license fees are dependent upon the performance of the services  the software license  configuration  training and implementation fees are recognized under the contract method of accounting using labor hours to measure the completion percentage 
in order to apply the contract method of accounting  management is required to estimate the number of hours needed to complete a particular project 
as a result  recognized revenues and profits are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of the actual cost to purchase and or manufacture or the current estimated market value of the inventory 
on a quarterly basis  inventory quantities on hand are reviewed and an analysis of the provision for excess and obsolete inventory is performed based primarily on our estimates of product demand and production requirements for the next twenty four months 
a change in the estimated timing or amount of demand for our products could result in additional provisions for excess inventory quantities on hand 
any significant unanticipated changes in demand could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and reported operating results 
goodwill and other intangible assets purchase accounting requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the fair market value of the assets and liabilities purchased  with the excess value  if any  being classified as goodwill 
in addition  as described in notes and of our financial statements  as a result of our acquisitions  values were assigned to intangible assets for patented and unpatented technologies and customer contracts and related relationships 
for those assets with finite lives  useful lives were assigned to these intangibles and they will be amortized over their remaining life 
we review our intangible assets and their related useful lives at least once a year to determine if any adverse conditions exist that would indicate the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable 
this review is called an impairment assessment 
we conduct more frequent impairment assessments if certain conditions exist  including a change in the competitive landscape  any internal decisions to pursue new or different technology strategies  a loss of a significant customer  or a significant change in the market place including changes in the prices paid for our products or changes in the size of the market for our products 
an impairment results if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the sum of the future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and disposition of the asset 
the amount of the impairment would be determined by comparing the carrying value to the fair value of the asset 
fair value is generally determined by calculating the present value of the estimated future cash flows using an appropriate discount rate 
the projection of the future cash flows and the selection of a discount rate require significant management judgment 
the key variables that management must estimate include sales volume  prices  inflation  product costs  capital expenditures and sales and marketing costs 
for developed technology patents and other technology that have not been deployed we also must estimate the likelihood of both pursuing a particular strategy and the level of expected market adoption 
significant judgment is involved in making these estimates 
future write downs may be required if the value of the assets become impaired 
property  plant and equipment property  plant and equipment are depreciated over their useful lives 
useful lives are based on our estimate of the period that the assets will generate revenue 
any change in conditions that would cause us to change our estimate as to the useful lives of a group or class of assets may significantly impact our depreciation expense on a prospective basis 
haemonetics equipment includes devices that we have loaned to our customers under contractual arrangements that allow them to use the device in exchange for rental payments or the purchase of disposables 
in addition to periodically reviewing the useful lives of these devices  we also periodically perform reviews to determine if a group of these devices is impaired 
to conduct these reviews we must estimate the future amount and timing of demand for these devices 
changes in expected demand can result in additional depreciation expense  which is classified as cost of goods sold 
any significant unanticipated changes in demand could have a significant impact on the value of equipment and our reported operating results 
income taxes in preparing our consolidated financial statements  income tax expense is calculated for all jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating actual current taxes due plus assessing temporary differences arising from differing treatment for tax and accounting purposes that are recorded as deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets are periodically evaluated to determine their recoverability 
a valuation allowance is established and a corresponding additional income tax expense is recorded in our statement of operations if their recovery is not likely 
the provision for income taxes could also be materially impacted if actual taxes due differ from our earlier estimates 
as of april   no valuation allowance existed on our balance sheet 
the total net deferred tax asset as of april  was million 
we file income tax returns in all jurisdictions in which we operate 
we established reserves to provide for additional income taxes that may be due in future years as these previously filed tax returns are audited 
these reserves have been established based on management s assessment as to the potential exposure attributable to permanent differences and interest applicable to both permanent and temporary differences 
all tax reserves are analyzed periodically and adjustments made as events occur that warrant modification

the majority of our operating expense spending does not require any advance commitment 
contingent commitments the acquisition of fifth dimension  which occurred on january   involves potential earn out payments of up to million based on fifth dimension reaching certain performance milestones prior to fiscal the first milestone payment  in the amount of million was earned and accrued as of the end of our fiscal this payment was allocated to goodwill and paid in the first quarter of fiscal we anticipate making an additional milestone payment in the first half of fiscal year the acquisition of the right to integrate a new pathogen reduction technology into our platelet collection devices includes certain incremental milestone payments based on the receipt of regulatory approvals in the us  europe and japan 
the total amount of these potential milestone payments is million 
in the third quarter of fiscal  baxter received initial regulatory approval in the european market 
in connection with this approval  we made an initial million milestone payment to baxter during the fourth quarter of fiscal despite expectations  the remaining european approvals were not obtained during fiscal when the approvals are obtained  we anticipate making an additional milestone payment of million to baxter 
these payments will be recorded as other technology  an intangible asset  and amortized over their useful lives 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a significant impact on our results of operations for the periods presented 
historically  we believe we have been able to minimize the effects of inflation by improving our manufacturing and purchasing efficiency  by increasing employee productivity and by adjusting the selling prices of new products we introduce 
foreign exchange approximately of our sales are generated outside the us in local currencies  yet our reporting currency is the us dollar 
our primary foreign currency exposures in relation to the us dollar are the japanese yen and the euro 
foreign exchange risk arises because we engage in business in foreign countries in local currency 
exposure is partially mitigated by producing and sourcing product in local currency and expenses incurred by local sales offices 
however  whenever the us dollar strengthens relative to the other major currencies  there is an adverse affect on our results of operations and alternatively  whenever the us dollar weakens relative to the other major currencies there is a positive effect on our results of operations 
it is our policy to minimize for a period of time  the unforeseen impact on our financial results of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates by using derivative financial instruments known as forward contracts to hedge the anticipated cash flows from forecasted foreign currency denominated sales 
hedging through the use of forward contracts does not eliminate the volatility of foreign exchange rates  but because we generally enter into forward contracts one year out  rates are fixed for a one year period  thereby facilitating financial planning and resource allocation 
we enter into forward contracts that mature one month prior to the anticipated timing of the forecasted foreign currency denominated sales 
these contracts are designated as cash flow hedges intended to lock in the expected cash flows of forecasted foreign currency denominated sales at the available spot rate 
actual spot rate gains and losses on these contracts are recorded in sales  at the same time the underlying transactions being hedged are recorded 
we compute a composite rate index for purposes of measuring  comparatively  the change in foreign currency hedge spot rates from the hedge spot rates of the corresponding period in the prior year 
the relative value of currencies in the index is weighted by sales in those currencies 
the composite was set at based upon the weighted rates at march  the composite rate is presented in the period corresponding to the maturity of the underlying forward contracts 
the favorable or unfavorable changes are in comparison to the same period of the prior year 
a favorable change is presented when we will obtain relatively more us dollars for each of the underlying foreign currencies than we did in the prior period 
an unfavorable change is presented when we obtain relatively fewer us dollars for each of the underlying foreign currencies than we did in the prior period 
these indexed hedge rates impact sales  and as a result also gross profit  operating income and net income  in our financial statements 
the final impact of currency fluctuations on the results of operations is dependent on the local currency amounts hedged and the actual local currency results

these statements are based on our current expectations and estimates as to prospective events and circumstances about which we can give no firm assurance 
further  any forward looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made  and we undertake no obligation to update any forward looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which such statement is made 
as it is not possible to predict every new factor that may emerge  forward looking statements should not be relied upon as a prediction of our actual future financial condition or results 
these forward looking statements  like any forward looking statements  involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or anticipated 
such risks and uncertainties include technological advances in the medical field and our standards for transfusion medicine and our ability to successfully implement products that incorporate such advances and standards  product demand and market acceptance of our products  regulatory uncertainties  the effect of economic and political conditions  the impact of competitive products and pricing  the impact of industry consolidation  foreign currency exchange rates  changes in customers ordering patterns  the effect of industry consolidation as seen in the plasma market  the effect of communicable diseases and the effect of uncertainties in markets outside the us including europe and asia in which we operate

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s exposures relative to market risk are due to foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk 
foreign exchange risk see the section entitled foreign exchange for a discussion of how foreign currency affects our business 
it is our policy to minimize for a period of time  the unforeseen impact on our financial results of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates by using derivative financial instruments known as forward contracts to hedge anticipated cash flows from forecasted foreign currency denominated sales 
we do not use the financial instruments for speculative or trading activities 
at april   we had the following significant foreign exchange contracts to hedge the anticipated cash flows from forecasted foreign currency denominated sales outstanding hedged buy sell weighted spot weighted forward currency local currency contract rate contract rate fair value maturity euro   apr may euro   june aug euro   sep nov euro   dec feb japanese yen  per us per us  apr may japanese yen  per us per us  june aug japanese yen  per us per us  sep nov japanese yen  per us per us  dec feb total  we estimate the change in the fair value of all forward contracts assuming both a strengthening and weakening of the us dollar relative to all other major currencies 
in the event of a strengthening of the us dollar  the change in fair value of all forward contracts would result in a million increase in the fair value of the forward contracts  whereas a weakening of the us dollar would result in a million decrease in the fair value of the forward contracts 
interest rate risk all of our long term debt is at fixed rates 
accordingly  a change in interest rates has an insignificant effect on our interest expense amounts 
the fair value of our long term debt  however  does change in response to interest rates movements due to its fixed rate nature 
at april   the fair value of our long term debt was approximately million higher than the value of the debt reflected on our financial statements 
this higher fair market is entirely related to our million  fixed rate senior notes and our million  real estate mortgage 
at march   the fair value of our long term debt was approximately million higher than the value of the debt reflected on our financial statements 
this higher fair market is entirely related to our million  fixed rate senior notes and our million  real estate mortgage 
using scenario analysis  if we changed the interest rate on all long term maturities by from the rate levels that existed at april  the fair value of our long term debt would change by approximately million 
concentration of credit risk and significant customers financial instruments that potentially subject the company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents  accounts receivable and investment in sales type lease receivables 
sales to one unaffiliated japanese customer  the japanese red cross society  amounted to million  million and million for  and  respectively 
accounts receivable balances attributable to this customer accounted for  and of total accounts receivable at fiscal year end  and  respectively 
while the accounts receivable related to the japanese red cross society may be significant  we do not believe the credit loss risk to be significant given the consistent payment history by this customer 
certain other markets and industries can expose us to concentrations of credit risk 
for example  we tend to have fewer larger customers in the commercial plasma business 
as a result our accounts receivable extended to any one of these commercial plasma customers can be somewhat significant at any point in time
