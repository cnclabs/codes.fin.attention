item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
overview parkway is a self administered and self managed reit specializing in the acquisition  operations and leasing of office properties 
the company is geographically focused on the southeastern and southwestern united states and chicago 
as of march  parkway owned or had an interest in office properties located in eleven states with an aggregate of approximately million square feet of leasable space 
the company generates revenue primarily by leasing office space to its customers and providing management and leasing services to third party office property owners including joint venture interests 
the primary drivers behind parkway s revenues are occupancy  rental rates and customer retention 
occupancy 
parkway s revenues are dependent on the occupancy of its office buildings 
as a result of job losses and over supply of office properties in some markets  vacancy rates have increased nationally and in parkway s markets 
the office sector currently is experiencing the highest vacancies in a decade 
as of january   occupancy of parkway s office portfolio was compared to as of october  and as of january  not included in the january  occupancy rate are signed leases totaling  square feet  which commence during the first through fourth quarter of and raise our percentage leased to 
to combat rising vacancy  parkway utilizes innovative approaches to produce new leases 
these include as the broker bill of rights  a short form lease and customer advocacy programs which are models in the industry and have helped the company maintain occupancy around during a time when the national occupancy rate is approximately 
parkway projects occupancy ranging from to in for its office properties 
rental rates 
an increase in vacancy rates has the effect of reducing market rental rates 
parkway s leases typically have three to seven year terms 
as leases expire  the company replaces the existing leases with new leases at the current market rental rate  which  in today s economy  is often lower than the existing lease rate 
customer retention is increasingly important in controlling costs and preserving revenue 
customer retention 
keeping our existing customers is important as high customer retention leads to increased occupancy  less downtime between leases  and reduced tenant improvement and leasing costs 
parkway estimates that it costs six times more to replace an existing customer with a new one 
this ratio represents the sum of downtime on the space plus leasing costs  which rise as market vacancies increase 
therefore  parkway focuses a great deal of energy on customer retention 
parkway s operating philosophy is based on the premise that we are in the customer retention business 
parkway seeks to retain its customers by continually focusing on operations at its office properties 
the company believes in providing superior customer service  hiring  training  retaining and empowering each employee  and creating an environment of open communication both internally and externally with our customers and our stockholders 
over the past seven years  parkway maintained an approximate customer retention rate 
parkway s customer retention for the year ending december  was compared to for the year ending december  in  customer retention was below the company s historical average primarily as a result of the loss of two major customers effective december  burlington industries  which occupied  square feet at north belt in houston  texas and skytel  a subsidiary of mci worldcom  inc worldcom  which occupied  square feet at the skytel centre in jackson  mississippi 
the company received approximately  annually in total revenue  after expenses from burlington and  annually in total revenue  after expenses from worldcom 
due to the loss of these two major customers  we anticipate that income from office and parking properties will decrease until such time as the vacant space can be leased 
subsequent to december   the company signed four leases for  square feet within the former burlington space at north belt 
also subsequent to december   the company announced the renaming of the skytel centre to city centre  the signing of leases which raise the city centre building occupancy to approximately and the development of a million  space parking facility to accommodate building customers 
the largest lease at city centre was signed with forman perry watkins krutz tardy llp for  square feet  commencing upon completion of the improvements to the space in the third quarter of forman perry will occupy the space through december   subject to certain termination rights beginning july  the firm is consolidating employees from two buildings in jackson and will vacate approximately  square feet in one jackson place  another parkway owned asset 
the other large new customers at city centre include entergy mississippi  inc and ross yerger  which leased  and  square feet  respectively 
strategic planning 
for many years  parkway has been engaged in a process of strategic planning and goal setting 
the material goals and objectives of parkway s earlier strategic plans have been achieved  and benefited parkway s stockholders through increased ffo and dividend payments per share 
effective january   the company adopted a three year strategic plan referred to as value value square 
this plan reflects the employees commitment to create value for its shareholders while holding firm to the core values as espoused in the parkway commitment to excellence 
the company plans to create value by venturing with best partners  asset recycling  leverage neutral growth  uncompromising focus on operations and providing an equity return to its shareholders that is greater than that of its peer group  the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit office index 
equity return is defined as growth in funds from operations ffo per diluted share 
the highlights of reflect the strategy set forth in value as described below venture with best partners 
during we sold joint venture interests in three office properties 
parkway continues to evaluate its existing portfolio for joint venture candidates and anticipates joint venturing more properties  as well as purchasing new properties with the intention of joint venturing them 
asset recycling 
the company sold one office property  while maintaining a year non cancelable management contract  and a three acre parcel of land 
using the proceeds from the joint ventures  property sales and stock offerings  parkway purchased four buildings totaling million 
leverage neutral growth 
parkway began with a debt to total market capitalization of and operated most of the year well below 
the decrease in debt to total market capitalization is a result of timing delays in reinvesting proceeds from joint ventures  asset sales and stock offerings 
once all of these funds have been reinvested  the company anticipates that the debt to total market capitalization will average around for the three years of value during  we closed four mortgages for approximately million  issued  common shares for a net million  redeemed  shares of series a preferred stock and issued million shares of series d preferred stock 
uncompromising focus on operations 
recognizing that in this difficult real estate environment  operating efficiently and consistently is more important than ever  parkway implemented the uncompromising focus on operations ufo program in the first quarter of  whereby parkway s customer advocate grades each property in all areas of consistency and high standards 
this is done in conjunction with the customer advocate interviews with each customer each year 
parkway continues to focus on the basics of our business customer retention  leasing  and controlling operating expenses and capital expenditures  to maintain our occupancy  which have the effect of maintaining and increasing revenues 
equity returns to shareholders greater than the nareit office index 
parkway is one third of the way through the value plan and achieved this financial goal for the first year of the plan 
ffo growth for the first twelve months of value was negative for the company  which exceeded the ffo growth of the nareit office index by more than 
financial condition comments are for the balance sheet dated december  compared to the balance sheet dated december  office and parking properties 
in  parkway continued the application of its strategy of operating and acquiring office properties  joint venturing interests in office assets  as well as liquidating non core assets and office assets that no longer meet the company s investment criteria and or the company has determined value will be maximized by selling

the sales proceeds were used to purchase the peachtree dunwoody pavilion 
in connection with the sale  the company paid  toward the early extinguishment of the mortgage secured by the bb t financial center 
the company is also considering selling its property in greenville  south carolina 
during the year ended december   the company recorded an impairment loss on the greenville  south carolina property in the amount of million 
the loss was created largely by rental rate decreases and current conditions within the market 
the estimated fair value of the greenville property was determined based on current prices of similar properties in the market area 
the decision to sell operating assets will be based upon the company s analysis of existing markets and competing investment opportunities 
investment in unconsolidated joint ventures 
in accordance with the company s three year strategic plan  value  parkway is committed to forming joint ventures with best partners for the purpose of acquiring office assets in the southeastern and southwestern united states and chicago 
parkway will operate  manage and lease the properties on a day to day basis  provide acquisition and construction management services to the joint venture  and receive fees for providing these services 
the joint venture partner will provide to of the joint venture capital  with parkway to provide the balance 
in  investment in unconsolidated joint ventures increased  or 
the primary reason for the increase is the result of parkway entering into two joint venture agreements with respect to three office properties 
see detailed information regarding the joint venture transactions under the caption joint ventures appearing in item business

after recording the write down  the carrying value corresponds with the net realizable value of the land  based on market research and comparable sales in the area 
the company expects to continue its efforts to liquidate its remaining non core assets 
interest  rents receivable and other assets 
interest  rents receivable and other assets increased  for the year ending december  the increase is primarily attributable to the increase in intangible assets due to the purchase of office properties in the increase in intangible assets represents the portion of the purchase price attributable to above or below market in place leases  lease costs and value of in place leases 
in  the total purchase price allocated to above or below market in place leases  lease costs and the value of in place leases was million 
parkway accounts for its acquisitions of real estate in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations  which requires the fair value of the real estate acquired to be allocated to acquired tangible and intangible assets 
notes payable to banks 
notes payable to banks decreased  or for the year ending december  the decrease is primarily attributable to proceeds from the joint ventures used to reduce amounts outstanding under the company s lines of credit 
we anticipate that the outstanding balance under the company s lines of credit will increase as the funds from the joint ventures are invested in new operating properties 
at december   notes payable to banks totaled  and resulted primarily from advances under bank lines of credit to purchase additional properties and to make improvements to office properties 
mortgage notes payable without recourse

the mortgage  which is interest only for the first three years  has a fixed interest rate of with a year term and a year amortization 
proceeds from the mortgage were used to reduce amounts outstanding under the company s lines of credit  pending future reinvestment in new properties 
on december   the company closed a  non recourse first mortgage secured by three properties in houston  texas 
the mortgage  which is interest only for the first year  has a fixed interest rate of with a year term and a year amortization 
proceeds from the mortgage were used to reduce amounts outstanding under the company s lines of credit  pending future reinvestment in operating properties 
the company expects to continue seeking fixed rate  non recourse mortgage financing with maturities from five to ten years typically amortizing over to years on select office building investments as additional capital is needed 
the company targets a debt to total market capitalization rate at a percentage in the mid s 
this rate may vary at times pending acquisitions  sales and or equity offerings 
in addition  volatility in the price of the company s common stock may affect the debt to total market capitalization ratio 
however  over time the company plans to maintain a percentage in the mid s 
in addition to this debt ratio  the company monitors interest and fixed charge coverage ratios 
the interest coverage ratio is computed by comparing the cash interest accrued to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
the fixed charge coverage ratio is computed by comparing the cash interest accrued  principal payments made on mortgage loans and preferred dividends paid to ebitda 
the computation of the interest and fixed charge coverage ratios and the reconciliation of net income to ebitda are as follows for the year ended december  and in thousands year ended december net income adjustments to net income interest expense amortization of financing costs prepayment expenses early extinguishment of debt depreciation and amortization amortization of deferred compensation gain loss on sale of joint venture interests and real estate tax expenses ebitda adjustments unconsolidated joint ventures ebitda interest coverage ratio ebitda interest expense interest expense interest expense unconsolidated joint ventures total interest expense interest coverage ratio fixed charge coverage ratio ebitda fixed charges interest expense preferred dividends preferred distributions unconsolidated joint ventures principal payments excluding early extinguishment of debt principal payments unconsolidated joint ventures total fixed charges fixed charge coverage ratio ebitda  a non gaap financial measure  means operating income before mortgage and other interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization 
we believe that ebitda is useful to investors and parkway s management as an indication of the company s ability to service debt and pay cash distributions 
ebitda  as calculated by us  is not comparable to ebitda reported by other reits that do not define ebitda exactly as we do 
ebitda does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  and should not be considered an alternative to operating income or net income as an indicator of performance or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as an indicator of liquidity

the accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are more fully described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
however  certain of our significant accounting policies are considered critical accounting policies due to the increased level of assumptions used or estimates made in determining their impact on our consolidated financial statements 
we consider our critical accounting policies and estimates to be those used in the determination of the reported amounts and disclosure related to the following impairment or disposal of long lived assets  depreciable lives applied to real estate and improvements to real estate  initial recognition  measurement and allocation of the cost of real estate acquired  and allowance for doubtful accounts impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
changes in the supply or demand of tenants for our properties could impact our ability to fill available space 
should a significant amount of available space exist for an extended period  our investment in a particular office building may be impaired 
we evaluate our real estate assets upon the occurrence of significant adverse changes to assess whether any impairment indicators are present that affect the recovery of the carrying amount 
real estate assets are classified as held for sale or held and used in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we record assets held for sale at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
with respect to assets classified as held and used  we periodically review these assets to determine whether our carrying amount will be recovered 
all of our long lived assets were classified as held and used at december  a long lived asset is considered impaired if its carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value 
fair value is based on the estimated and realizable contract sales price if available for the asset less estimated costs to sell 
if a sales price is not available  the estimated undiscounted cash flows of the asset for the remaining useful life are used to determine if the carrying value is recoverable 
the cash flow estimates are based on assumptions about employing the asset for its remaining useful life 
factors considered in projecting future cash flows include but are not limited to existing leases  future leasing and terminations  market rental rates  capital improvements  tenant improvements  leasing commissions  inflation and other known variables 
upon impairment  we would recognize an impairment loss to reduce the carrying value of the long lived asset to our estimate of its fair value 
our estimate of fair value and cash flows to be generated from our properties requires us to make assumptions 
if one or more assumptions proves incorrect or if our assumptions change  the recognition of an impairment loss on one or more properties may be necessary in the future  which would result in a decrease in net income 
no impairment losses were recognized for the year ending december  however  in  the company recorded an impairment loss on its office property in greenville  south carolina in the amount of million and on acres of non earning land in new orleans  louisiana in the amount of  depreciable lives applied to real estate and improvements to real estate 
depreciation of buildings and parking garages is computed using the straight line method over an estimated useful life of years 
depreciation of building improvements is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the improvement 
if our estimate of useful lives proves to be incorrect  the depreciation expense recognized would also be incorrect 
therefore  a change in the estimated useful lives assigned to buildings and improvements would result in either an increase or decrease in depreciation expense  which would result in an increase or decrease in earnings 
initial recognition  measurement and allocation of the cost of real estate acquired 
parkway accounts for its acquisitions of real estate in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations  which requires the fair value of the real estate acquired to be allocated to the acquired tangible assets  consisting of land  building  garage  building improvements and tenant improvements  and identified intangible assets and liabilities  consisting of the value of above and below market leases  customer relationships  lease costs and the value of in place leases 
parkway allocates the purchase price to the fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property by valuing the property as if it were vacant 
the as if vacant value is allocated to tangible assets based on the relative fair value of those assets 
value is allocated to tenant improvements based on the estimated costs of similar tenants with similar terms 
the difference between the purchase price and the as if vacant value represents the fair value of the intangible assets or the intangible gap 
the intangible gap is then allocated among the identifiable intangible assets 
we determine the fair value of the tangible and intangible components using a variety of methods and assumptions all of which result in an approximation of fair value 
differing assumptions and methods could result in different estimates of fair value and thus  a different purchase price allocation and corresponding increase or decrease in depreciation and amortization expense 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
our receivable balance is comprised primarily of rents and operating expense recoveries due from tenants 
change in the supply of or demand for office properties could impact our tenants ability to honor their lease obligations  which could in turn affect our recorded revenues and estimates of the collectibility of our receivables 
revenue from real estate rentals is recognized and accrued as earned on a pro rata basis over the term of the lease 
we regularly evaluate the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts considering such factors as credit quality of our tenants  delinquency of payment  historical trends and current economic conditions 
we provide an allowance for doubtful accounts for tenant balances that are over days past due and for specific tenant receivables for which collection is considered doubtful 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  which could result in an increase or decrease in bad debt expense 
funds from operations management believes that funds from operations ffo is an appropriate measure of performance for equity reits and computes this measure in accordance with the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit definition of ffo 
ffo as reported by parkway may not be comparable to ffo reported by other reits that do not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition 
we believe ffo is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure that enhances the comparability of our operations by adjusting net income for items not reflective of our principal and recurring operations 
this measure  along with cash flows from operating  financing and investing activities  provides investors with an indication of our ability to incur and service debt  to make capital expenditures and to fund other cash needs 
in addition  ffo has widespread acceptance and use within the reit and analyst communities 
funds from operations is defined by nareit as net income computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of property and extraordinary items under gaap  plus depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis 
in  nareit clarified that ffo related to assets held for sale  sold or otherwise transferred and included in results of discontinued operations should continue to be included in consolidated ffo 
this clarification is effective january   and calculation of ffo based on this clarification should be shown for all periods presented in financial statements or tables 
we believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our operating results  ffo should be examined in conjunction with the net income as presented in our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this form k 
funds from operations do not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and is not an indication of cash available to fund cash needs 
funds from operations should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indicator of the company s operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity 
the following table presents a reconciliation of the company s net income to ffo for the years ended december  and in thousands  except per share data total dollar amount diluted per share year ended year ended december december net income adjustments to derive funds from operations depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization discontinued operations adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures preferred dividends convertible preferred dividends original issue costs redemption of preferred stock gain on real estate and joint venture interests amortization of deferred gains and other diluted share adjustment for convertible preferred stock funds from operations applicable to common shareholders in  parkway recorded an impairment loss on land of  and on an office property of  consistent with nareit s current definition of ffo  parkway excluded the impairment loss on the office property from ffo and included the impairment loss on land in ffo for the year ending december  in october   the sec staff shared with nareit its position that all impairment write downs must be included in ffo for all periods included in future filings 
therefore  ffo as originally reported for the year ending december  has been reduced by the office property impairment loss of  additionally  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
 effective for fiscal years beginning after may   any gain or loss on extinguishment of debt that was classified as an extraordinary item in prior periods shall be reclassified 
for the year ending december   parkway recognized  as an extraordinary loss on extinguishment of debt 
accordingly  this amount has been reclassified to interest expense prepayment expenses and included in ffo 
considering the items discussed above  ffo as originally reported of  for the year ending december  has been revised to  inflation in the last five years  inflation has not had a significant impact on the company because of the relatively low inflation rate in the company s geographic areas of operation 
most of the leases require the tenants to pay their pro rata share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes and insurance  thereby reducing the company s exposure to increases in operating expenses resulting from inflation 
in addition  the company s leases typically have three to seven year terms  which may enable the company to replace existing leases with new leases at market base rent  which may be higher or lower than the existing lease rate

as of december   total outstanding debt was approximately  of which  or  is variable rate debt 
if market rates of interest on the variable rate debt fluctuate by or approximately basis points  the change in interest expense on the variable rate debt would increase or decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately  annually
