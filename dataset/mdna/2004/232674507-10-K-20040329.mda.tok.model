item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are committed to being the innovator and leader in providing products for the treatment of patients with functional somatic syndromes and other related chronic pain and central nervous system disorders 
functional somatic syndromes refer to several related syndromes characterized more by symptoms  suffering and disability than by disease specific abnormalities that are found upon physical examination and include many overlapping pain and psychiatric conditions such as fibromyalgia syndrome  or fms  irritable bowel syndrome  non cardiac chest pain and interstitial cystitis  or chronic pelvic pain 
our goal is to be the first to commercialize a product approved in the united states for the treatment of fms  the focus of our initial efforts in the area of functional somatic syndromes 
we recently commenced a phase iii trial for milnacipran in the treatment of fms 
in january  we entered into a collaboration agreement with forest laboratories  inc  a leading marketer of central nervous system drugs with a strong franchise in the primary care and psychiatric markets  for the development and marketing of milnacipran 
we are conducting our inital phase iii trial and will conduct our second phase iii trial in collaboration with forest laboratories 
these two phase iii trials and any additional studies needed for regulatory approval could possibly be completed in and  if successful  a new drug application  or nda  for fms could possibly be submitted later in that year 
we completed a phase ii trial evaluating milnacipran for the treatment of fms in the fall of the phase ii trial was a three month  randomized  placebo controlled study involving sites and fms patients who were randomized to either milnacipran treatment or placebo 
in this clinical trial  milnacipran was shown to provide statistically significant improvement in pain  the primary symptom of fms 
no unexpected safety concerns arose from this trial and there were no serious adverse events 
we obtained an exclusive license for milnacipran from pierre fabre medicament in milnacipran has been marketed outside of the united states since as an antidepressant and has been used by over  patients worldwide 
we have paid pierre fabre a total of million  including upfront payments of million in connection with the execution of the original license agreement in and a million milestone payment in september additional payments to pierre fabre of up to a total of million will be due to pierre fabre based on meeting certain clinical and regulatory milestones 
under our agreement with forest laboratories  we sublicensed our rights to milnacipran to forest laboratories for the united states  with an option to extend the territory to include canada 
additionally  forest laboratories assumed responsibility for funding all continuing development of milnacipran  including the funding of clinical trials and regulatory approval  as well as a specified number of our employees 
forest laboratories will also be responsible for sales and marketing activities related to any product developed under the agreement  while we have the option to co promote up to of the total physician details 
we are continuing to evaluate various potential strategic transactions  including the potential acquisitions of products  technologies and companies  and other alternatives that we believe may enhance stockholder value 
in august  we entered into a reformulation and new product agreement with collegium pharmaceutical  inc pursuant to which collegium is attempting to develop reformulations of milnacipran and new products that are analogs of milnacipran 
we estimate that we currently have additional obligations to collegium under this agreement of approximately million exclusive of milestone and royalty obligations and out of pocket expenses 
if we pursue clinical development of a product candidate developed under this agreement  we would be obligated to pay collegium milestone payments of up to million in the aggregate upon achievement of defined clinical and regulatory objectives  as well as potential royalty payments based on the net sales of reformulated or new products 
in october  we also entered into a common stock issuance agreement with collegium  pursuant to which collegium may elect to be issued shares of our common stock  subject to certain conditions  in lieu of cash  for milestone payments 
we are continuing to evaluate other various potential strategic transactions  including the potential acquisitions of products  technologies and companies  and other alternatives that we believe may enhance stockholder value 
we changed our business focus in based on our analysis of the economics related to the prosorba column and the potential market opportunities in the field of fms  our initial focus in the area of functional somatic syndromes 
prior to december   we were engaged in the product development and marketing of the prosorba column  a medical device  which was marketed for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura 
on january   we sold to fresenius hemocare most of our assets related to the prosorba column  including the united states food and drug administration pre market approval and applications for the prosorba column 
fresenius is now solely responsible for all ongoing clinical trials  regulatory support  and the marketing and distribution of the prosorba column as discussed below 
we are responsible for prosecuting and maintaining the patents and trademarks related to the prosorba column 
in addition  we agreed to indemnify fresenius for any losses related to patent or trademark infringement claims 
on january   we restructured our agreement with fresenius to grant fresenius an exclusive license to distribute the prosorba column in the united states  europe and latin america and  subject to certain conditions  japan and select asian countries 
fresenius assumed all of the sales  marketing and clinical efforts associated with the prosorba column worldwide 
we also transferred to fresenius most of our assets associated with the prosorba column 
we received an upfront payment of million  a portion of which reflected prepaid royalties on the sales of  prosorba columns in any year during the initial five years of the agreement 
in light of lower sales than we and fresenius anticipated when we restructured the agreement  in february   we and fresenius further restructured the economic terms of the agreement pursuant to a second restructured agreement dated february  under the second restructured agreement  we agreed that the million upfront fee paid in january would cover the royalties on all sales of the prosorba column in the initial seven year period commencing january and that this payment was non refundable under any circumstances 
we are not entitled to any additional royalty payments during the initial seven year period of the agreement 
in addition  whereas under the first restructured agreement  we were entitled to certain royalty payments on sales of the prosorba column after january  pursuant to the terms of the second restructured agreement  a contingent payment is due to us in the amount of million if sales during the first seven years exceed  units  million if they exceed  units and none if the sales are less than  units 
such payment  if any  will be due on january  and is non refundable 
as of december   we had working capital of approximately million and an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we received an upfront payment of million from forest laboratories on january  of which we owe million to pierre fabre  which is not included in our working capital 
our future success depends on our ability to develop and market new products for the treatment of functional somatic syndromes  such as fms  and other related chronic pain and central nervous system disorders 
revenue we currently are not generating any revenues from product sales and we do not expect to generate revenues from products sales for at least the next several years  if at all 
we expect our revenues for the next several years to consist of payments under our current collaboration agreement and any additional collaborations  including the million upfront payment received upon execution of the collaboration agreement with forest laboratories and any upfront payments under new agreements  research and related fees payable during the development term of the agreements and milestone payments contingent upon the achievement of agreed upon objectives 
the amount of funding for development of milnacipran may change periodically as we jointly agree upon the number of our personnel assigned to the development efforts 
our collaboration agreement is subject to early termination by forest laboratories upon specified events  including breach of the agreement 
research and development expenses our research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel expenses for our research and development personnel  fees paid to external service providers  patient enrollment costs  fees and milestone payments under license and development agreements  and costs for facilities  supplies  materials and equipment 
in  fees paid to external service providers consisted primarily of costs associated with the clinical development of milnacipran  including clinical supply costs and clinical research organization costs 
we charge all research and development expenses to operations as incurred 
beginning in january  forest laboratories will pay the costs of the ongoing phase iii clinical trial of milnacipran 
during  we will continue to fund research and development for new product development  including payments under our reformulation and new product agreement with collegium 
forest laboratories has the option to acquire the rights to any new product developed under the collegium agreement and would assume payment of expenses under this agreement if it exercises its option 
we also will incur research and development expense for sublicense payments made to pierre fabre as well as any milestone payments if any become payable during the year 
as a result of our agreement with forest laboratories  we expect our research and development expenses in to decline from levels 
because of the risks and uncertainties that are discussed in the risk factors section of this report  we are unable to estimate the specific timing and future costs of our research and development programs 
results of operations comparison of years ended december   and revenues we had no revenue for the year ended december  compared to revenue of million for the year ended december  and revenue of million for the year ended december  in the first quarter of  we recognized revenue of million under the second restructured agreement with fresenius after the agreement was restructured and the upfront payment of million made in became non refundable 
prior to these modifications  we had accounted for the million payment as deferred revenue  and had amortized this amount on a straight line basis over five years  at the rate of  per quarter 
revenues for consisted of the first year of amortization of the upfront payment from fresenius 
research and development research and development expenses were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the increase in research and development expenses in compared to is primarily attributable to the non cash charge in the amount of million recognized during the second quarter of in connection with the issuance of  shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock to pierre fabre as a license fee  a million milestone payment paid to pierre fabre in september upon initiation of our phase iii clinical trial of milnacipran  costs incurred during of approximately million in connection with our phase iii clinical trials for milnacipran  including expenses for clinical research organization and trial consultants  and higher bonuses for research and development executives accrued in the fourth quarter of following commencement of the phase iii clinical trial of milnacipran 
during the year ended december   we incurred costs of approximately million related to the phase ii clinical trial for milnacipran compared to corresponding costs of million during  as all costs associated with the phase ii trial were substantially completed by the first quarter of during  we also incurred costs of approximately  in connection with a reformulation and new product agreement entered into with collegium  which included an upfront payment in the amount of  as well as a project management fee of  and reimbursement of certain out of pocket expenses 
during  we incurred million in licensing fees to pierre fabre for the licensing of milnacipran and costs of approximately  in connection with the filing of an investigational new drug  or ind  application for milnacipran with the fda 
in addition  as discussed below in compensation expense variable stock options  we recorded million of total compensation expense for variable stock options for related to research and development expenses 
for  we recorded million of the compensation benefit for variable stock options related to research and development expenses and for  we recorded million of the compensation expense for variable stock options related to research and development expenses 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december the increase in general and administrative expenses from to was primarily due to increased executive bonuses accrued in the fourth quarter of and increased legal  consulting and travel costs related to business development activities in  including costs incurred in connection with our collaboration agreement with forest laboratories 
during  we incurred initial set up costs related to the implementation of a database for our physician and patient registries focused on patients with fms and physicians that treat patients with fms that were not incurred during the decrease in general and administrative expenses from to was primarily due to lower business development costs in in  we experienced significant business development activity related to the execution of our license agreement with pierre fabre and our efforts to license other potential drug candidates for fms 
in  our efforts were primarily focused on our phase ii clinical trial for our licensed compound  milnacipran 
in addition  as discussed below in compensation expense variable stock options  we recognized million of total compensation expense for variable stock options for related to general and administrative expenses 
for  we recognized million of the compensation benefit for variable stock options related to general and administrative expenses and for  we recognized million of the compensation expense for variable stock options related to general and administrative expenses 
compensation expense variable stock options in june  we implemented an option cancel and re grant program  which resulted in variable accounting for the newly issued options under financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
fin  accounting for certain transaction involving stock compensation an interpretation of apb as a result  we recorded stock compensation expense totaling approximately  consisting of approximately  related to research and development expenses and approximately  related to general and administrative expenses  for the year ended december  during  the intrinsic value of the common stock underlying the options declined  which means that our stock price declined 
in accordance with fin  we reversed approximately  consisting approximately of  related to research and development expenses and approximately  related to general and administrative expenses  of the cumulative  charge 
during  the intrinsic value of the common stock underlying the options increased due to an increase in our stock price during the period the closing price on december  was  so we recognized compensation expense of million  consisting of approximately million related to research and development expenses and approximately million related to general and administrative expenses 
in the event our stock price is above on march   we will record additional compensation charges however  we cannot predict what our stock price will be in the future and it may be substantially lower than 
interest income interest and other income  net  for the year ended december  was  compared to  for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december  the decrease in interest and other income during in comparison to is primarily due to a change in the composition of our cash and cash equivalents balance and lower market rates for our cash investments 
during  a majority of our cash balance was invested in short term investments classified as available for sale  whereby unrealized gains or losses are recorded as a component of stockholders equity  compared to the corresponding period in  during which our cash balance was primarily invested in money market accounts 
the decrease in interest income in from was primarily due to lower market rates for our cash investments 
interest expense interest expense for the year ended december  was  compared to  for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december  the decreases in interest expense during compared to and during compared to were primarily due to lower outstanding debt 
the remaining balance of our prior outstanding term loan was paid in full in july liquidity and capital resources at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and short term investments of million for a total of million compared to cash and cash equivalents of million and short term investments of million for a total of million at december  working capital at december  totaled million compared to million at december  in january  we received an upfront license payment of million of which we will pay million to pierre fabre as a sublicense fee from forest laboratories that is not reflected in our working capital at december  we have invested a substantial portion of our available cash in high quality marketable debt instruments of governmental agencies 
we have established guidelines relating to our investments to preserve principal and maintain liquidity 
net cash used in operating activities totaled million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the primary use of cash in both periods was to fund our net loss in the period 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in net cash used in investing activities from to was primarily a result of the purchase of short term securities  net of the proceeds of the sale of short term securities 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in net cash provided by financing activities from to was primarily the result of the net proceeds of approximately million from the private placement of our common stock and warrants to purchase our common stock completed in april and proceeds of approximately million from the exercise of stock options and warrants during  offset by net proceeds of approximately million from the private placement of our common stock and warrants to purchase our common stock completed in march the following table summaries our long term contractual obligations december  in thousands total less than year years years more than years capital leases  including interest payments    operating leases    purchase obligations   total    purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services  including consulting services  that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms 
this includes contracts that are cancelable with notice and the payment of an early termination penalty 
purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty and also exclude liabilities to the extent presented on the balance sheet as of december  other commercial commitments include certain potential milestone  sublicense and royalty payments to pierre fabre and collegium discussed in the overview section 
contractual obligations for which we will be reimbursed by forest laboratories are not included in the table above 
until we can generate significant cash from our operations  we expect to continue to fund our operations with existing cash resources that were primarily generated from the proceeds of offerings of our equity securities and from revenue from our collaboration agreement 
our current expected primary cash needs on both a short term and long term basis are for the identification  acquisition or license  and development of potential future products  working capital and other general corporate purposes 
in addition to the amounts required to pay any amounts payable under our agreements with pierre fabre and collegium  and costs of in licensing or acquiring additional compounds  we estimate that based on our current business plan  we will require approximately million to fund our operations for the year in the event we acquire  license or develop any new products  the amount to fund our operations for would increase 
we expect the current trend of net losses to continue for at least the next several years as we seek to acquire  license or develop additional products for the treatment of functional somatic syndromes 
such losses may fluctuate  and the fluctuations may be substantial 
based on our current business plan  we believe our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances at december   as well as the million upfront payment received from forest laboratories in january  net of our payment to pierre fabre  are sufficient to fund operations for the next several years 
our expected primary cash needs on both a short term and long term basis are for the identification  acquisition or license  and development of potential future products  working capital and other general corporate purposes 
in order to acquire or develop additional products for the treatment of functional somatic syndromes  we will require additional capital 
the amount of capital we require is dependent upon many forward looking factors that could significantly increase our capital requirements  including the following the costs of in licensing drug candidates for the treatment of functional somatic syndromes  the costs and progress of our clinical trials  the ability of our collaborators and us to reach milestones  and other events or developments under our collaboration agreements  results of our research and development efforts  the costs and timing of regulatory approvals  the costs of commercialization of any future products  and the extent to which we acquire or invest in other products  technologies and businesses  although we currently have no commitments or agreements relating to any of these types of transactions 
because we are unable to predict the outcome of the foregoing factors  some of which are beyond our control  we are unable to estimate with certainty our mid to long term capital needs 
until we can generate a sufficient amount of product revenue  if ever  we expect to finance future capital needs through public or private equity offerings  including under our shelf registration statement that was declared effective by the sec on january   registering a total dollar amount of million of our common stock  debt financings or collaboration and licensing arrangements  as well as interest income earned on cash balances 
we do not currently have any commitments for future external funding 
we may not be able to raise additional capital through such sources and the funds we raise  if any  may not allow us to maintain our current and planned operations 
if we are unable to obtain additional capital  we may be required to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our planned research and development activities related to the development of milnacipran and any future additional product candidates 
to date  we have not had any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which are established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  licenses for research and development  stock based compensation and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following are some of the more critical accounting policies that affect the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements see also the notes to our financial statements 
revenue recognition in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  revenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenue is deferred for fees received before earned 
licenses for research and development we expense research and development costs as they are incurred pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for research and development costs  as the ultimate commercialization of the related products is uncertain and the technology has no alternative uses 
in connection with our agreement with pierre fabre  we paid upfront fees of million and a million milestone payment in september and are also obligated to make additional payments based on meeting certain clinical and regulatory milestones 
the total payments to date of million have been expensed pursuant to sfas no 
we also issued pierre fabre  shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock in the second quarter of in connection with the second restated license agreement 
pursuant to sfas no 
 the additional license consideration in the form of these equity instruments has been expensed as the ultimate commercialization of the related product is uncertain and the technology has no alternative uses 
additionally  in connection with our agreement with collegium  the upfront and project management fees paid to collegium have been expensed pursuant to sfas no 
 as well as the other direct costs incurred in connection with the agreement 
stock based compensation we grant stock options for a fixed number of shares to employees in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
apb  accounting for stock issued to employees  as amended by sfas no 
fas  accounting for stock based compensation 
accordingly  we ordinarily recognize no compensation expense for stock option grants to employees provided that the option exercise price is not less than the fair market value of the underlying stock on the date of grant 
the value of options or stock awards issued to non employees has been determined in accordance with fas and emerging issues task force no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring or in conjunction with selling goods and services  and is periodically re measured as the options vest 
for the years ended december  and  we recorded compensation expense of  and  respectively  related to options issued to consultants 
in june  we entered into an option cancel and re grant program  which resulted in variable accounting for the newly issued options under financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
fin  accounting for certain transaction involving stock compensation an interpretation of apb pursuant to fin  the intrinsic value of the options to purchase common stock will be re measured at the end of each period for the term of the option and amortized over the vesting period 
during the year ended december   as the intrinsic value of the common stock underlying the options increased due to an increase in our stock price  we recognized compensation expense of  however  due to a decline in our stock price during the year ended december   we reversed  of the cumulative compensation charge 
in the event our stock price is above closing price on december  on march   we will record additional compensation charges however  we cannot predict what our stock price will be in the future and it may be substantially lower than 
pursuant to the option cancel and re grant program  options with certain exercise prices held by certain of our employees  including executive officers  and directors were exchanged for options with an exercise price of  the fair market value of our common stock on june   the date the program was effected 
valuation allowance for deferred tax assets a valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not these items will either expire before we are able to realize their benefit  or that future deductibility is uncertain 
in general  companies that have a history of operating losses are faced with a difficult burden of proof on their ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in the near future in order to realize the benefit of the deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets in the amount of million as of december  based on our history of losses 
the deferred tax assets are still available for us to use in the future to offset taxable income  which would result in the recognition of a tax benefit and a reduction to our effective tax rate 
recent accounting pronouncements in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin no 

fin no 
requires that upon issuance of a guarantee  the guarantor must disclose and recognize a liability for the fair value of the obligation it assumes under that guarantee 
the initial recognition and measurement requirements of fin no 
are effective for guarantees issued or modified after december  the disclosure requirements of fin no 
are effective for interim and annual periods ending after december   and are applicable to certain guarantees issued before december  the company adopted fin no 
disclosure requirements as of december  the adoption of the provisions for recognition and initial measurement did not have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
requires that certain financial instruments  which under previous guidance were accounted for as equity  must now be accounted for as liabilities 
the financial instruments affected include mandatorily redeemable stock  certain financial instruments that require or may require the issuer to buy back some of its shares in exchange for cash or other assets and certain obligations that can be settled with shares of stock 
sfas no

in december  the fasb issued a revision to fasb interpretation no 
fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin r replaces fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  which was issued in january fin r requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
a variable interest entity either a does not have equity investors with voting rights or b has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources to the entity to support its activities 
fin r is effective immediately for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after december  the adoption of fin is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we invest our excess cash in united states government securities  certificates of deposit and money market funds with strong credit ratings 
as a result  our interest income is most sensitive to changes in the general level of united states interest rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments  derivative commodity instruments or other market risk sensitive instruments  positions or transactions in any material fashion 
accordingly  we believe that  while the investment grade securities we hold are subject to changes in the financial standing of the issuer of such securities  we are not subject to any material risks arising from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  equity prices or other market changes that affect market risk sensitive instruments 
a hypothetical adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially affect the fair value of our financial instruments that are exposed to changes in interest rates
