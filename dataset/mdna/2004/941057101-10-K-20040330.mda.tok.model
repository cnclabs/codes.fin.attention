item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this report for the years ended december  and overview we are a regional  vertically integrated provider of solid waste services 
we were founded by the chairman of the board of directors in we operate primarily in north carolina  south carolina  virginia  tennessee  mississippi  georgia and florida  providing solid waste collection  transfer  recycling  processing and disposal services for commercial  industrial  municipal and residential customers 
at december   we operated collection operations  transfer stations  approximately county convenience drop off centers  five recycling facilities and landfills in the southeastern us we had revenues of million and operating income of million in the year ended december   and revenues of million and operating income of million in the year ended december  from through  we acquired  either by merger or asset purchase  solid waste collection or disposal operations 
seventy one of these acquisitions were accounted for as purchases 
accordingly  the results of operations of these acquired businesses have been included in our financial statements only from the respective dates of acquisition and have affected period to period comparisons of our operating results 
during the year ended december   we did not have any significant acquisitions requiring historical or pro forma financial statements to be presented 
we anticipate that a significant part of our future growth will come from acquiring additional solid waste collection  transfer and disposal businesses and  therefore  we expect that additional acquisitions could continue to affect period to period comparisons of our operating results 
current levels of population growth and economic development in the southeastern us and our strong market presence in the region should provide an opportunity to increase our revenues and market share 
as we add customers in existing markets  our density should improve  which we expect will increase our collection efficiencies and profitability 
executive overview in we rolled out five initiatives for achieving positive results and improving our performance 
they are identify and capture specific growth opportunities  take an aggressive pricing posture  strengthen our workforce at every level  work to retain our profitable customers  institutionalize and follow proven disciplined operating practices 
our performance for was impacted to a significant extent by conditions or circumstances beyond our control 
while the first and second quarters had heavy rainfall throughout the southeast resulting in higher disposal cost  the last two quarters included the effects of hurricane isabel where of our company and of our employees were in the track of this powerful storm  resulting in lost revenues  impaired productivity and extensive recovery and assistance cost for our operations 
the combination of a sluggish economy and excess hauling capacity within many of our markets translated to a price pushback from existing customers and less than desired margins for new customers 
despite these challenges  our revenues increased  our workforce actually declined and our revenues per man hour improved by nearly 
in addition  our fleet count is also down from two years ago by approximately units 
these statistics indicate that we have continued to look for and find ways to improve our efficiency and productivity 
we implemented a pricing strategy to adjust pricing on accounts that were not meeting standards and in some cases we chose to give up accounts that refused reasonable price increases 
this pricing strategy resulted in pricing growth for each quarter of internal volume growth was negative for the first two quarters of as a result of the loss of a municipal transfer hauling contract at the beginning of the year  but was positive for the total year with the last two quarters averaging approximately over the prior year 
this growth was primarily the result of increased landfill tonnage from a third party contract starting in the third quarter and strong national accounts growth in the fourth quarter 
acquisition growth was for in which we completed six acquisitions and exited four markets 
the third quarter acquisition in our existing norfolk  virginia market is our largest single acquisition to date 
we strive to be number one or number two in our markets and if this is not achievable in the near future  our strategy is to eventually exit those markets 
most acquisitions in were tuck ins and a continuation of our acquisition plan to expand in selected markets in order to achieve better route density and leverage our overhead cost structure 

table of contents we have experienced  as have others in this industry sector  increased operating costs which include higher fuel costs  health benefits costs  property and casualty insurance premiums  and higher professional fees required to meet legal and accounting compliance standards brought about by the sarbanes oxley act of these increases have affected our profit margins and bottom line 
to achieve our goals  we use route optimization tools such as route smart and route balance to focus on route productivity and optimization 
in addition we have increased employee training and centered our efforts on fleet maintenance  data management  and customer pricing 
in  we believe these efforts will better position our company as the economy moves toward recovery 
our capital expenditures of approximately million increased by million over the prior year due primarily to a major expansion at our sampson county  north carolina landfill 
despite higher capital spending and our largest acquisition to date  the debt to total capitalization ratio of at december  was consistent with the prior year 
our million revolver credit facility was amended in the third quarter of and matures in february we believe this facility provides sufficient capital in combination with our cash flow from operating activities to fund our near term growth strategy and capital expenditures 
finally  as a result of our consistent positive cash flow  our board of directors implemented an per share semi annual dividend which was paid in december results of operations general our branch waste collection operations generate revenues from fees collected from commercial  industrial and residential collection and transfer station customers 
we derive a substantial portion of our collection revenues from commercial and industrial services that are performed under one year to five year service agreements 
our residential collection services are performed either on a subscription basis with individual households  or under contracts with municipalities  apartment owners  homeowners associations or mobile home park operators 
residential customers on a subscription basis are billed quarterly in advance and provide us with a stable source of revenues 
a liability for future service is recorded upon billing and revenues are recognized at the end of each month in which services are actually provided 
municipal contracts in our existing markets are typically awarded  at least initially  on a competitive bid basis and thereafter on a bid or negotiated basis and usually range in duration from one to five years 
municipal contracts provide consistent cash flow during the terms of the contracts 
our prices for our solid waste services are typically determined by the collection frequency and level of service  route density  volume  weight and type of waste collected  type of equipment and containers furnished  the distance to the disposal or processing facility  the cost of disposal or processing  and prices charged in our markets for similar services 
our ability to pass on cost increases is sometimes limited by the terms of our contracts 
long term solid waste collection contracts typically contain a formula  generally based on a predetermined published price index  for automatic adjustment of fees to cover increases in some  but not all  operating costs 
at december   we operated approximately convenience sites under contract with counties in order to consolidate waste in rural areas 
these contracts  which are usually competitively bid  generally have terms of one to five years and provide consistent cash flow during the term of the contract since we are paid regularly by the local government 
at december   we also operated eight recycling processing facilities as part of our collection and transfer operations where we collect  process  sort and recycle paper products  aluminum and steel cans  pallets  plastics  glass and other items 
our recycling facilities generate revenues from the collection  processing and resale of recycled commodities  particularly recycled wastepaper 
through a centralized effort  we resell recycled commodities using commercially reasonable practices and seek to manage commodity pricing risk by spreading the risk among our customers 
we also operate curbside residential recycling programs in connection with our residential collection operations in most of the communities we serve 
operating expenses for our collection operations include labor  fuel  equipment maintenance and tipping fees paid to landfills 
at december   we operated or transferred from transfer stations that reduce our costs by improving our utilization of collection personnel and equipment and by consolidating the waste stream to gain more favorable disposal rates 
at december   we owned or operated landfills 
operating expenses for these landfill operations include labor  equipment  legal and administrative  ongoing environmental compliance  host community fees  site maintenance and accruals for closure and post closure maintenance 
cost of equipment sales primarily consists of our cost to purchase the disposal compactors and containers that we resell 
we capitalize certain expenditures related to pending acquisitions or development projects 
indirect acquisition and project development costs  such as executive and corporate overhead  public relations and other corporate services  are expensed as incurred 

table of contents our policy is to charge against net income any unamortized capitalized expenditures and advances net of any portion thereof that we estimate to be recoverable  through sale or otherwise relating to any operation that is permanently shut down  any acquisition that is not consummated and any landfill development project that is not expected to be successfully completed 
engineering  legal  permitting  construction and other costs directly associated with the acquisition or development of a landfill  together with associated interest  are capitalized 
selling  general and administrative  or sg a  expenses include management salaries  clerical and administrative overhead  professional services  costs associated with our marketing and sales force and community relations expense 
property and equipment is depreciated over the estimated useful life of the assets using the straight line method 
other income has not historically been material to our results of operations 
to date  inflation has not had a significant impact on our operations 
critical accounting policies we have established various accounting policies that govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america in the preparation of our financial statements 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we consider our critical accounting policies to be those accounting policies that require us to make significant estimates and assumptions that have a material impact on the carrying value of our assets and liabilities 
the estimates and assumptions we use are based on historical experience and other factors  which we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ significantly from these estimates and assumptions that could have a material impact on the carrying value of our assets and liabilities at the balance sheet dates and our results of operations for the reporting periods 
we believe the following are critical accounting policies that require the most significant estimates and assumptions that are particularly susceptible to a significant change in the future allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
based on our collection history  we determined a percentage based on the age of the receivable that we deem collectible 
the allowance is then calculated by applying the appropriate percentage to each of our receivables 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million at december  and  respectively 
if the financial condition of our customers was to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
self insurance reserves we assume the risks for medical and dental insurance exposures up to certain loss thresholds set forth in separate insurance contracts 
we have established self insurance reserves for these risks  which are estimated based on evaluations performed by independent third parties 
adoption of sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations effective january   we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
in connection with the adoption of sfas no 
 we recorded approximately million  net of income taxes  or per diluted share  in the first quarter of as a charge to cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
the effect of applying the provisions of sfas no 
was a reduction in income before cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for the year ended december  of approximately million  net of income taxes  or per diluted share 
effective january   our method of accounting for landfill closure and post closure  as well as landfill final capping  changed as a result of our adoption of sfas no 
sfas no 
does not change the basic landfill accounting that we and others in the industry have followed historically 
through december   the waste industry generally recognized expenses associated with amortization of capitalized and future landfill asset costs and future closure and post closure obligations on a units of 
table of contents consumption basis as airspace was consumed over the life of the related landfill 
this practice  referred to as life cycle accounting within the waste industry  continues to be followed 
for further explanation  see note l 
a brief explanation of final capping  closure and post closure is as follows final capping costs we are required to estimate the cost of each final capping event which involves covering the landfill with a flexible membrane and geosynthetic clay liner  compacted soil layers and topsoil and provide drainage for the areas of the landfill where total airspace capacity has been consumed 
the estimates also consider when these costs would be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates 
for each final capping event we quantify the landfill capacity associated with each final capping event and the final capping costs and amortize it over the related capacity associated with the event as waste is disposed at the landfill 
closure post closure costs closure costs include the last final capping event  the construction of the methane gas collection system  demobilization and routine maintenance costs incurred after the site ceases to accept waste  but prior to being certified as closed 
post closure activities which include final landfill retirement activities once regulatory requirements are met  consist of routine maintenance of the landfill after it has closed  monitoring the ground and surface water  gas emissions and air quality 
estimates for future closure and post closure costs are based on costs that would actually be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates 
the possibility of changes to legal and regulatory requirements makes our estimates and assumptions uncertain 
we amortize landfill retirement costs arising from closure and post closure obligations using our historical landfill accounting practices 
we amortize landfill retirement costs arising from final capping obligations on a units of consumption basis over the number of tons of waste that each final capping event covers 
landfill accounting we have material financial commitments for final capping  closure and post closure obligations with respect to our landfills 
we develop our estimates of final capping  closure and post closure obligations using input from our third party engineers and internal accounting 
our estimates are based on our interpretation of current requirements and proposed regulatory changes and are intended to approximate fair value 
absent quoted market prices  the estimate of fair value should be based on the best available information  including the results of present value techniques in accordance with statement of financial accounting concepts  or sfac  no 
 using cash flow and present value in accounting measurements 
in general  we rely on third parties to fulfill most of our obligations for final capping  closure and post closure 
accordingly  the fair market value of these obligations is based upon quoted and actual prices paid for similar work 
we intend to perform some of these capping  closure and post closure obligations using internal resources 
where internal resources are expected to be used to fulfill an asset retirement obligation  we have added a profit margin onto the estimated cost of such services to better reflect their fair market value as required by sfas no 
when we then perform these services internally  the added profit margin is recognized as a component of operating income in the period earned 
sfac no 
further states that an estimate of fair value should include the price that marketplace participants are able to receive for bearing the uncertainties in cash flows 
however  when utilizing discounted cash flow techniques  reliable estimates of market premiums may not be obtainable 
in this situation  sfac no 
indicates that it is not necessary to consider a market risk premium in the determination of expected cash flows 
in the waste industry  there is not an active market that can be utilized to determine the fair value of these activities as there is no market that exists for selling the responsibility for final capping  closure and post closure obligations independent of selling the landfill in its entirety 
accordingly  we believe that it is not possible to develop a methodology to reliably estimate a market risk premium and have excluded a market risk premium from our determination of expected cash flows for landfill asset retirement obligations in accordance with sfac no 
once we have determined the estimates of final capping  closure and post closure obligations  we then inflate those costs to the expected time of payment and discount those expected future costs back to present value 
we are currently inflating these costs in current dollars until expected time of payment using an inflation rate of and are discounting these costs to present value using a credit adjusted  risk free discount rate of 
the credit adjusted  risk free rate is based on the risk free interest rate adjusted for our credit standing 
management reviews these estimates at least once per year 
significant changes in future final capping  closure and post closure cost estimates and inflation rates typically result in both a current adjustment to the recorded liability and corresponding adjustment to the landfill asset  based on the landfill s capacity that has been consumed  and a change in liability and asset amounts to be recorded prospectively over the remaining capacity of the landfill 
any change related to the capitalized and future cost of the landfill asset is then recognized in amortization expense prospectively over the remaining capacity of the landfill 
changes in our credit adjusted  risk free rate do not change recorded liabilities  but subsequently recognized obligations are measured using the revised credit adjusted risk free rate 
we record the estimated fair value of final capping  closure and post closure obligations for our landfills based on the landfills capacity that has been consumed through the current period 
this liability and corresponding asset is accrued on a per ton basis 
the estimated fair value of each final capping event will be fully accrued when the tons associated with such capping event have been disposed in the landfill 
additionally  the estimated fair value of total final capping  closure and post closure costs will be fully 
table of contents accrued for each landfill at the time the site discontinues accepting waste and is closed 
closure and post closure accruals consider estimates for methane gas control  leachate management and ground water monitoring and other operational and maintenance costs to be incurred after the site discontinues accepting waste  which is generally expected to be for a period of up to years after final site closure 
daily maintenance activities  which include many of these costs  are incurred during the operating life of the landfill and are expensed as incurred 
daily maintenance activities include leachate disposal  surface water  groundwater  and methane gas monitoring and maintenance  other pollution control activities  mowing and fertilizing the landfill cap  fence and road maintenance  and third party inspection and reporting costs 
for purchased disposal sites  we assess and record present value based final capping  closure and post closure obligations at the time we assume such responsibilities 
such liabilities are based on the estimated final capping  closure and post closure costs and the percentage of airspace consumed related to such obligations as of the date we assumed the responsibility 
thereafter  we account for the landfill and related final capping  closure and post closure obligations consistent with the policy described above 
interest accretion on final capping  closure and post closure obligations is recorded using the effective interest method and is recorded as final capping  closure and post closure expense  which is included in operating costs on the income statement 
in the united states  the closure and post closure obligations are established by the environmental protection agency s subtitles c and d regulations  as implemented and applied on a state by state basis 
the costs to comply with these obligations could increase in the future as a result of legislation or regulation 
we routinely review our investment in operating landfills to determine whether the costs of these investments are realizable 
judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on regulatory factors  market conditions and operational performance of our landfills 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that our landfill carrying costs are impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
while the precise amounts of these future obligations cannot be determined  at december   we estimate our total landfill closure and post closure costs to be approximately million 
we provide accruals for these estimated costs as the remaining permitted airspace of landfills is consumed 
our estimate of these costs considers when the costs would actually be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates 
at december  and  we had accrued approximately million and million  respectively  for such costs 
significant revisions in the estimated lives of our landfills or significant increases in our estimates of landfill closure and post closure costs could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
derivative financial instruments we formally document our hedge relationships  including identifying the hedge instruments and hedged items  as well as our risk management objectives and strategies for entering into the hedge transaction 
our derivative instruments qualify for hedge accounting treatment under sfas no 
in order to qualify for hedge accounting  criteria must be met  including a requirement that both at inception of the hedge  and on an ongoing basis  the hedging relationship is expected to be highly effective in offsetting cash flows attributable to the hedged risk during the term of the hedge 
when it is determined that a derivative ceases to be a highly effective hedge  we discontinue hedge accounting  and any gains or losses on the derivative instrument are recognized in earnings 
allocation of acquisition purchase price acquisition purchase price is allocated to identified intangible assets and tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on our estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition  with any residual amounts allocated to goodwill 
the purchase price allocations are considered preliminary until we are no longer waiting for information that we have arranged to obtain and that is known to be available or obtainable 
although the time required to obtain the necessary information will vary with circumstances specific to an individual acquisition  the allocation period for finalizing purchase price allocations generally does not exceed one year from the consummation of a business combination 
we often consummate single acquisitions of solid waste collection or disposal operations 
for each separately identified solid waste collection or disposal operation acquired in a single acquisition  we perform an initial allocation of total purchase price to the acquired operation based on our relative fair value 
following this initial allocation of total purchase price to the acquired operation  we further allocate the identified intangible assets and tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed for each solid waste collection or disposal operation based on our estimated fair value at the dates of acquisition  with any residual amounts allocated to either goodwill or landfill site costs  as discussed above 

table of contents we accrue the payment of contingent purchase price if the events surrounding the contingency are deemed assured beyond a reasonable doubt 
contingent purchase price related to solid waste collection or disposal operations is allocated to goodwill 
goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we discontinued amortization of goodwill effective january  on an ongoing basis  we perform an annual impairment test 
at least quarterly  we analyze whether an event has occurred that would more likely than not reduce its enterprise fair value below its carrying amount and  if necessary  will perform a goodwill impairment test between annual dates 
impairment adjustment after adoption  if any  will be recognized as an operating expense 
we adopted july as our annual assessment date 
we completed our annual impairment test july  and determined that there was no goodwill impairment 
long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets  we review long lived assets for impairment on a market by market basis whenever events or changes in the circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset might not be recoverable 
if an evaluation is required  the projected future net cash flows on an undiscounted basis attributable to each market would be compared to the carrying value of the long lived assets including an allocation of goodwill  if appropriate of that market 
if an impairment is indicated  the amount of the impairment is measured based on the fair value of the asset 
we also evaluate the remaining useful lives to determine whether events and circumstances warrant revised estimates of such lives 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations

total revenues increased million  or  to million in  from million in this increase was attributable primarily to the effect of six businesses acquired during the year ended december  and eight businesses and contracts acquired during the year ended december   offset by the disposition of four businesses resulting in a net increase of million 
also contributing to the increase in revenues were an increase of approximately million in 
table of contents industrial revenue  an increase of approximately million in residential service revenue  an increase of approximately million in landfill  disposal and special waste revenue  an increase in annexation fees  fuel surcharges and other miscellaneous revenue of approximately million 
these increases were offset by a decrease of approximately million in transfer station revenue due to the loss of a municipal contract  compared to the same period in our revenue growth of was comprised of of acquisition growth and of internal growth 
we were more effective in initiating price increases in due to a disciplined approach towards customer profitability analysis and utilizing our pricing optimization software 
pricing increased  or million  and energy related surcharges increased  or million  versus internal volume was up  primarily from year over year growth in landfill tonnage 
total cost of operations 
total cost of operations increased million  or  to million in from million in this increase was primarily attributed to the effect of six businesses acquired during the year ended december  and eight businesses and contracts acquired during the year ended december   offset by the disposition of four businesses during resulting in an increase in disposal and transfer expenses of million  increased casualty and workers compensation insurance of approximately million and increased labor costs and associated expenses of approximately million 
total cost of operations as a percentage of revenues increased from to for and  respectively

an additional million of increased amortization was due to higher disposal volume 
in accordance with sfas no 
 effective january   landfill assets are amortized to depreciation and amortization expense as airspace is consumed over the life of the specific final capping event or the life of the landfill for closure and post closure 
gain on sale of collection and hauling operations 
we recognized a gain on sale of collection and hauling operations totaling approximately  and a loss of approximately  at december  and  respectively 
these sales were a divestiture of assets in certain markets that did not meet our profitability goals 
interest expense net of interest income 
interest expense net of interest income decreased million  or  to million in from million in this decrease was primarily attributable to lower average debt levels and interest rates during the majority of  compared to debt increased in the third quarter of by million due to acquisition activity and landfill expansion in the third and fourth quarters of income tax expense

cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
as a result  for the year ended december   we recognized a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of million net of tax benefit of million

net income 
net income decreased million  or  to million in from million in this decrease was primarily attributable to increased cost of operations  sg a costs  depreciation and amortization expense and a charge for a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  which offset our total revenue growth 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
total revenues increased million  or  to million in  from million in this increase was attributable primarily to the effect of three businesses acquired during the year ended december  and eight businesses and contracts acquired during the year ended december   resulting in a million increase  offset by the decrease in revenues associated with collection operations and hauling assets sold of million and the effect of prices and collection volumes resulting from new municipal and commercial contracts and residential subscriptions  resulting in an increase of million 

table of contents total cost of operations 
total cost of operations increased million  or  to million in from million in this increase was attributable primarily to increased casualty and worker compensation insurance of approximately million  increased fleet maintenance costs of approximately million  increased labor costs and associated expenses of approximately million  increased landfill maintenance expense of approximately million  offset by decreased landfill and disposal fees of approximately million due to increased internalization 
total cost of operations as a percentage of revenues increased from to for and  respectively 
these increases in operations were primarily the result of the pervasive increase in insurance costs facing all industries  including the waste industry  coupled with the expansion of our existing operations through acquisitions 
sg a 
sg a decreased million  or  to million in from million in this decrease was attributable primarily to enhanced productivity and cost containment strategies employed during the year 
these initiatives resulted in decreased labor costs and related expenses of approximately million  lower bad debt provisions of approximately million and decreased postage fees of million 
we also incurred organizational costs of approximately million for  which were primarily related to our holding company reorganization 
the reorganization enabled us to simplify our organizational structure  segregate for operational and liability purposes our distinct business activities and those of our subsidiaries  allow greater autonomy to companies currently owned or to be acquired by us in the future  and make it easier to implement future secured credit facilities at reduced costs of implementation 
we did not incur these costs in sg a as a percentage of revenues decreased to in from in as a result of synergies achieved through acquisitions and enhanced productivity

liquidity and capital resources our working capital at december  was million and million at december  our strategy in managing our working capital has been to apply the cash generated from operations that remains available after satisfying our working capital and capital expenditure requirements to reduce indebtedness under our bank revolving credit facility and to minimize our cash balances 
we generally finance our working capital requirements from internally generated funds and bank borrowings 
in addition to internally generated funds  we have in place financing arrangements to satisfy our currently anticipated working capital needs in prior to  we had fully drawn our three million term loan facilities with prudential insurance company of america 
in  we began principal repayments on the first million term facility 
the prudential facilities require us to maintain financial ratios  such as minimum net worth  net income  and limits on capital expenditures and indebtedness 
interest on the three prudential facilities is paid quarterly  based on fixed rates for the three facilities of  and  respectively  and the facilities mature as follows million in april  million in june and million in february  subject to renewal 
on august   we amended and extended our revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of lending institutions for which fleet national bank acts as agent 
this fleet credit facility provides up to million through february virtually all of our assets  and those of our subsidiaries  including our interest in the equity securities of our subsidiaries  secure our obligations under the fleet credit facility 
pursuant to an intercreditor agreement with fleet  prudential shares in the collateral pledged under the fleet credit facility 
in addition  our subsidiaries have guaranteed our obligations under the prudential term loan facilities 
the fleet credit facility 
table of contents bears interest at a rate per annum equal to  at our option  either a fleet base rate or at the eurodollar rate based on eurodollar interbank market rates plus  in each case  a percentage rate that fluctuates  based on the ratio of our funded debt to ebitda income before income taxes plus interest expense and depreciation and amortization  from to for base rate borrowings and to for euro rate borrowings 
the fleet credit facility requires us to maintain financial ratios and satisfy other requirements  such as minimum net worth  net income  and limits on capital expenditures and indebtedness 
it also requires the lenders approval of acquisitions in some circumstances 
as of december   million was outstanding under the fleet credit facility  and the average interest rate on outstanding borrowings was approximately 
on september   we entered into a million income tax exempt variable rate demand bond with sampson county  north carolina for the funding of expansion at our landfill in that county 
this bond is in addition to our existing million sampson bond outstanding at december  both bonds are backed by a letter of credit issued by wachovia bank trust as a participating lender under our fleet syndication 
the average interest rate on outstanding borrowings under both sampson bonds was approximately at december  as of december   we were in compliance with all covenants and restrictions related to all outstanding borrowings 
as of december   we had the following contractual obligations and commercial commitments in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year to years to years over years long term debt expected landfill liabilities disposal agreements capital expenditures operating leases capital leases total contractual cash obligations includes amounts outstanding as of december  of million under our fleet credit facility  million under the prudential term facilities  and million under the sampson bond facilities 
our fleet credit facility allows us to borrow up to million provided we are in compliance with loan covenants 
availability under the fleet facility was approximately million at december  landfill liabilities are based on current costs and include capping  closure  post closure and environmental remediation costs 
these costs represent the total expected landfill liabilities we will incur over the life of our landfills 
we recognize these liabilities as airspace which is consumed in each landfill 
amount of commitment expiration per period commercial commitments total amounts committed less than year to years to years over years standby letters of credit performance bonds total commercial commitments net cash provided by operating activities totaled million for the year ended december  and consisted primarily of net income of million plus non cash adjustments eg depreciation and amortization  etc 
of million and decreased working capital of million 
for the year ended december   net cash used in investing activities was million 
of this  million was used to fund the cash portion of acquisitions  offset by provided from the sale of collection and hauling operations  million was 
table of contents used for acquisition related liabilities and million was used for capital expenditures  of which million was for landfill expansion  with the balance primarily for investments in equipment  consisting primarily of trucks and containers 
cash inflows from investing activities included million received from the sale of property and equipment 
capital expenditures were million for compared to million in in  we expect to spend approximately million on capital expenditures  including million for vehicle and equipment additions and replacements  approximately million for landfill site improvements  approximately million for support equipment and approximately million for facilities  additions and improvements 
we expect to fund our planned capital expenditures principally through internally generated funds and borrowings under existing credit facilities 
as an owner and potential acquirer of additional new landfill disposal facilities  we might also be required to make significant expenditures to bring newly acquired disposal facilities into compliance with regulatory requirements 
we might also be required to make significant expenditures to obtain permits for newly acquired disposal facilities or expand the available disposal capacity at any newly acquired disposal facilities 
the amount of these expenditures cannot be currently determined because they will depend on the nature and extent of any acquired landfill disposal facilities  the condition of any facilities acquired and the permitting status of any acquired sites 
we expect we would fund any capital expenditures to acquire solid waste collection and disposal businesses and any regulatory expenses for newly acquired disposal facilities  to the extent we could not fund such acquisitions with our common stock  and any regulatory expenses for newly acquired disposal facilities through borrowings under our existing credit facilities 
we have financial obligations relating to closure and post closure costs  or long term care of disposal facilities that we operate or for which we are or might become responsible 
landfill closure and post closure costs include estimated costs to be incurred for final closure of landfills and estimated costs for providing required post closure monitoring and maintenance of landfills 
we estimate these future cost requirements based on our interpretation of the technical standards of the epa s subtitle d regulations 
while we cannot determine the precise amounts of these future obligations  at december   we estimate the total costs to be approximately million for capping  final closure of our operating facilities and post closure monitoring costs 
our estimate of these costs considers when the costs would actually be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates 
we provide accruals for these future costs generally for a term of years after final closure of any landfill  and will provide additional accruals for these and other landfills we might acquire or develop in the future  based on engineering estimates of consumption of airspace over the useful lives of such facilities 
due to the inherent uncertainties related to the total costs for capping  final closure of our operating facilities and post closure monitoring costs  there can be no assurance that our ultimate financial obligations for actual closure or post closure costs will not exceed the amount accrued and reserved or amounts otherwise receivable pursuant to insurance policies or trust funds 
such a circumstance could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
for the year ended december   net cash provided by financing activities was million  which included net borrowings under long term debt including capital leases of million and proceeds from exercised options of million  offset by cash used for financing cost of million  dividends paid of million and capital lease payments of million

seasonality our results of operations tend to vary seasonally  with the first quarter typically generating the least amount of revenues  higher revenues in the second and third quarters  and a decline in the fourth quarter 
this seasonality reflects the lower volume of waste during the fall and winter months primarily due to lower construction activities 
also  operating and fixed costs remain relatively constant throughout the calendar year  which  when offset by these revenues  results in a similar seasonality of operating income
