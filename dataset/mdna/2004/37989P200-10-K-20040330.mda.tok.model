item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
overview glycogenesys  inc is a biotechnology company developing carbohydrate based drugs 
our lead drug candidate  gcs  a potential treatment for multiple forms of solid tumors and bloodborne cancers  completed a phase ii a clinical trial for pancreatic cancer in april and completed a phase ii a clinical trial for colorectal cancer in march we began a phase i dose escalation trial in february dosing in patients at up to mg m and announced the results of this trial in october during  we made improvements to our manufacturing process to remove substantially all the ethanol from the final formulation of gcs and have manufactured this low ethanol product in preparation for our upcoming clinical trial program 
in addition  during  we have recruited additional members to our development team  both full time employees and consultants  and to our scientific advisory board with diverse and complementary industry experience to assist management in the design of clinical trials  compliance with the regulatory processes of the fda  manufacturing and scientific development 
our clinical trial program using the low ethanol formulation of gcs is planned to begin in april may with a phase i dose escalation trial to test gcs as a monotherapy in up to patients 
phase i ii trials are planned to test gcs in combination with standard chemotherapies which will enroll patients each with the option of expanding the size based on a review of clinical activity 
phase ii trials are planned in an indication of cancer with unmet clinical needs evaluating gcs s safety and efficacy as a monotherapy 
additional phase ii trials are planned to evaluate gcs each in combination with different approved chemotherapeutic agents 
the phase ii program could enroll over patients 
we will determine the cancer indications for the phase ii clinical trial program based on an evaluation of all pre clinical and clinical data  as well as considering the current unmet clinical needs and the shortest timeline for approval 
our clinical trial program is subject to our having sufficient financial resources 
at the end of  we had million of cash available  however  we completed a financing in january resulting in million of net proceeds 
as of march   we have million of cash on hand 
research and development expenses in are expected to be significantly higher than in primarily due to the planned clinical trial program 
the phase i trials described in the previous paragraph may cost approximately million and the phase ii trials described in the previous paragraph may cost approximately million 
the amount of clinical trial expense incurred in will depend on the timing of such trials 
we expect to have less third party development expenses  but higher in house development expenses in due to the start up of our own laboratory facilities 
we expect payroll expenses to increase as we begin hiring additional staff members  adding approximately persons over the next two years 
early hires will include analytical chemists in connection with the laboratory 
g a expenses are expected to increase primarily due to increased insurance and regulatory compliance costs  and for increased travel related to clinical trials 
we believe that our financial risks will be somewhat higher as unfolds as we incur a higher fixed cost base due to opening the laboratory  making commitments to conduct the clinical trials  hiring additional staff and legal costs 
we must raise significant additional funds to move forward in the product development clinical trial process 
our financial strategy for and beyond is to secure the necessary financial resources to pay for the development of gcs  either through repartnering with a large biotechnology or pharmaceutical company or raising funds in the capital markets or a combination of both 
we have also developed two agricultural products elexa  a registered trademark of ours and bb  which we plan to sell or dispose of 
we have entered into an agreement with a third party to purchase the elexa product line on certain agreed terms  subject to customary conditions 
we do not expect to receive material upfront payments for the sale of our agricultural products 
critical accounting policies the company s significant accounting policies are described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
the company s critical accounting policies are those that are important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and operating results and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the company believes that its most critical accounting policies are as follows termination of joint venture with elan in december  the company terminated its joint venture with elan 
pursuant to the termination agreement  the company acquired all of elan s equity interest in safescience newco in exchange for a royalty interest on certain future revenues and payments related to gcs under the termination agreement  such royalty payments  if any  are to be reduced by certain development costs to be incurred by the company 
a discounted cash flow analysis was applied to both the estimated future royalty payments and the offsetting development costs to be incurred by the company to measure the cost of the acquisition and the related liability 
the valuation of the royalty liability was determined using an income approach  discounted based on the estimated likelihood that such payments will ultimately be required to be made 
based upon this analysis  the company believes that the fair value of the development costs to be reimbursed by elan approximates the fair value of the estimated future royalty payments  accordingly no liability for the future contingent royalty payments has been reflected in the company s financial statements 
accrued clinical research organization costs the preparation of financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reported period 
specifically  our management must make estimates of costs incurred to date but not yet invoiced in relation to external clinical research organization  or cro  costs 
management analyzes the progress of clinical trials  invoices received and budgeted costs when evaluating the adequacy of the accrued liability 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the accrued balance in any accounting period 
while the company bases its judgments and estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that management believes are appropriate and reasonable under current circumstances  actual results may differ from those estimates 
any changes to these estimates would affect both our operating results and cash flows 
results of operations year ended december  versus year ended december  we had a net loss applicable to common stock of  for the year ended december  versus a net loss applicable to common stock of  for the year ended december  the net loss applicable to common stock for the year ended december  included a charge of  for dividends accreted on our series b convertible preferred stock compared to a charge of  for dividends accreted on our series a and b convertible preferred stock for the year ended december  research and development expenses developing carbohydrate based therapeutic compounds is our primary business focus and to a lesser extent  we formerly developed nontoxic agricultural products 
both areas are  or were  in the research and development phase and explanations of the changes in both areas from year to year are described in this section 
our research and development expenses for the years ended december  and were reported in the following financial statement captions years ended december  gcs equity in loss of safescience newco r d total gcs other products r d total research development expenses total research and development expenses for the year ended december  decreased by approximately  or  from the year ended december total gcs development expenses of  represent a decrease of  from the  of expenses incurred during the year ended december  this decrease is primarily attributable to a reduction of license fees paid to wayne state university of  and non cash research and development expenses of  in connection with warrants issued to wayne state university and the barbara ann karmanos cancer institute to purchase common stock that vested during cost of managing our clinical trials decreased  or  to  during the year ended december  from  for the year ended december   primarily due to completion of the field work on both the colorectal and pancreatic trials 
these reductions were partially offset by increased production costs for gcs of  to create inventory for future trials 
however  as described earlier  we believe our development expenses for will increase significantly as a result of additional clinical trials 
in july  the company transferred its rights to gcs in the field of oncology to safescience newco in connection with the formation of a joint venture with elan 
costs related to gcs incurred after the transfer to safescience newco  which were on behalf of safescience newco  were expensed by safescience newco 
these research and development costs were incurred either by the company or eis on behalf of safescience newco 
we reported our share of such expenses as a component of our equity in the loss of safescience newco 
all expenses associated with development of gcs incurred prior to the formation of safescience newco were recorded in the line item research development r d in the consolidated statement of operations 
following the termination of the joint venture with elan  on december   expenses associated with the development of gcs are again charged to r d expenses 
research and development expenses for elexa and bb  our agricultural compounds  which consisted primarily of wages  consulting and license fees  decreased  or  to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the decrease reflects the company s de emphasis of its agricultural products 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december   a decrease of  or 
this decrease was principally attributable to reductions of approximately i  in professional fees  ii  in investor relations expenses  iii  in office related expenses  iv  in outside consulting expenses  v  in non cash expenses  vi  in annual report costs and vii  in travel expenses 
these decreases were partially offset by i increased payroll expense of  ii  of expenses charged to safescience newco and included as a component of equity in loss of safescience newco and iii a premium increase of  for director and officer liability insurance 
interest income interest income decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december   a decrease of  or 
this decrease was attributable to a reduction in cash available for investment and lower rates of return on those investments 
results of operations year ended december  versus year ended december  we had a net loss applicable to common stock of  for the year ended december  versus a net loss applicable to common stock of  for the year ended december  the net loss applicable to common stock for the year ended december  included a charge of  for dividends accreted on our series a and b convertible preferred stock compared to a charge of  for dividends accreted on our series a convertible preferred stock for the year ended december  we had a loss from continuing operations of  for the year ended december  versus a loss from continuing operations of  for the year ended december  the loss for the year ended december  included a charge in the amount of  related to our equity in the loss of safescience newco  compared to a charge in the amount of  related to our equity in the loss of safescience newco for the year ended december  research and development expenses developing carbohydrate based therapeutic compounds is our primary business focus and to a lesser extent  we formerly developed nontoxic agricultural products 
both areas are  or were  in the research and development phase and explanations of the changes in both areas from year to year are described in this section 
our research and development expenses for the years ended december  and were reported in the following financial statement captions years ended december  gcs equity in loss of safescience newco r d total gcs other products r d total research development expenses total research and development expenses for the year ended december  decreased by approximately  or  from the year ended december total gcs development expenses of  for the year ended december  represent a decrease of  or  from the  of expenses incurred during the year ended december  this decrease is primarily attributable to the expense incurred in conjunction with the license fee paid to elan by safescience newco in the amount of  in   of which was included in the equity in loss of safescience newco during the year ended december  other decreases include reductions of approximately i  in reduced costs associated with clinical trials  ii  in non cash compensation related to warrants granted to wayne state university and the barbara ann karmanos cancer institute as compensation for a license  iii  in license fees paid to wayne state university  iv  in gcs production expense  and v  in expenses for sponsored research 

these reductions were partially offset by increases in clinical  professional  analytical and consulting services of approximately  costs incurred by elan related to gcs included in the equity in loss of safescience newco of approximately  staffing related expenses of approximately  and royalty payments of approximately  research and development expenses for elexa and bb  our agricultural compounds  which consisted primarily of wages  consulting  registration and license fees  increased  or  to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the increase reflects additional field trials performed in and additional federal and state registrations 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december   a decrease of  or 
this decrease was principally attributable to reductions of approximately i  in non cash compensation for stock options granted to employees  ii  in outside consulting expenses  iii  in expenses charged to safescience newco and included as a component of our equity in loss of safescience newco  iv  in legal expenses  and v  in public relations expenses  partially offset by increased expenses for accounting of approximately  and insurance of approximately  interest income interest income decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december   a decrease of  or 
this decrease was attributable to a reduction in cash available for investment and lower rates of return on those investments 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  the company has funded its operations primarily with the proceeds from equity securities totaling approximately million 
for the year ended december   the company s operations utilized cash of approximately  primarily to fund the operating loss 
this use of cash was offset by equity financings that resulted in net proceeds of approximately  to the company 
in  the company s operations utilized cash of approximately  which was offset by equity financings that resulted in net proceeds of approximately  capital expenditures for the years ended december  and  which totaled  and  respectively  primarily related to computer and office equipment 
the company has no significant commitments for the purchase of equipment  product manufacturing facilities or marketing efforts at present 
the company leases office facilities under an operating lease that ends in march and laboratory space under an operating lease that ends in january rent expense for these spaces will be approximately  in the company anticipates that its current offices and lab will be adequate for its space requirements for the foreseeable future 
the company has retained glenmere clinical research  inc  a contract research organization cro and medidata solutions  inc  a provider of electronic data capture services  to support its clinical trial program 
they provide clinical research management  medical and safety monitoring  data management and medical writing and regulatory services 
the total cost of glenmere and medidata s services are estimated to be approximately  for the initial phase i dose escalation monotherapy trial which is expected to be paid through march in addition  the cro costs associated with the planned future phase i and phase ii iii trials are estimated at  for fixed costs for each trial plus  per patient 
there are additional non cro costs associated with planned future clinical trials of approximately  per patient 
the company expects to incur substantial additional operating costs  including costs related to ongoing and planned research and development activities and preclinical studies 
the company is seeking to expand its product pipeline under development 
potential new product candidates will either be developed internally or licensed by the company 
the cost related to the development of new product candidates is projected to be in the range of  to  during the twelve months ended december   although it could be higher 
as of december   the company s cash and cash equivalents were approximately  as compared to approximately  as of december  in january  the company raised approximately million in net proceeds from the sale of common stock and warrants to purchase common stock 
the company has a  stand by line of credit with a bank secured by the company s cash and cash equivalents  which had no outstanding balance as of december  and secured letters of credit in the aggregate amount of  which is held as security for deposits required by its lease of office and lab space 
the company terminated its stand by letter of credit on march  the company has no other commercial financing sources at present but may seek such sources in the future 
it is not known whether additional funds could be borrowed from stockholders or other sources 
as of march   the company s cash and cash equivalents were approximately  the company s future is dependent upon its ability to obtain financing to fund its operations 
as of march   the company has not obtained commitments from any existing or potential investors to provide additional financing 
the company expects to incur substantial additional operating costs  including costs related to ongoing research and development activities  preclinical studies and clinical trials 
to the extent that the company is unable to raise additional capital on a timely basis  management may prioritize research activities to conserve cash 
in the event additional financing is not obtained  the company may be required to significantly reduce or curtail operations 
the company believes that its existing funds will be sufficient to fund its operating expenses and capital requirements into the third quarter of consistent with prioritizing r d expenditures 
the company intends to raise additional equity financing 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements as such term is defined in item of regulation s k that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
payment obligations our future  noncancellable  contractual commitments  are summarized in the following table in thousands thereafter lease payments purchase obligations license payments total rental payments for office space at st 
james  boston  massachusetts and for laboratory space at one kendall square  cambridge  massachusetts during  the company executed an agreement with wayne state university and the barbara ann karmanos cancer institute 
this agreement grants the company an exclusive world wide license to patents  patent applications  and other intellectual property related to gcs material issued  developed  or applied for by wayne state university and the barbara ann karmanos cancer institute 
in order to maintain its rights under this agreement  the company may be required to make additional payments of up to  which are contingent upon reaching future commercialization milestones 
specifically  the company must on the first occurrence of the following milestones a pay wayne state university and the barbara ann karmanos cancer institute  within thirty days following the date on which the company commences phase iii clinical drug investigations relating to gcs  b pay wayne state university and the barbara ann karmanos cancer institute  within thirty days following the date on which the company makes a new drug application nda submission to the fda relating to gcs  and c pay wayne state university and the barbara ann karmanos cancer institute  within thirty days following the date on which the fda approves an nda of the company covering gcs in addition  the company must pay  per month until fda approval for gcs  which payments are offset against the royalty jointly to wayne state university and the barbara ann karmanos cancer institute the company must pay on net sales of gcs in january  the company agreed that one of its founders  dr 
david platt  would receive a royalty of of net sales  in exchange for the licensed patent rights on certain products being developed 
the company has agreed to pay all of the costs to procure and maintain any patents granted under this agreement 
the agreement includes a requirement that the royalties paid in the ninth year of this agreement and all subsequent years meet a minimum requirement of  the company accrued a  liability as of december   which was subsequently paid in january pursuant to the company s termination agreement with elan regarding its safescience newco joint venture  the company acquired the preferred shares of safescience newco held by elan in exchange for a royalty interest on certain future revenues and payments related to gcs the company will be obligated to pay elan a percentage on certain net revenues  which include license fees  milestone payments  royalties  net manufacturing profits  payments received in the disposition of gcs  particular research and development payments and premiums paid for the company s common stock 
the company will not be obligated to make any payments to elan on payments the company receives that are for reimbursement of direct expenses or contractually required to be used for certain research and development costs and for which the full time employee reimbursement rate does not exceed industry standards 
in addition  if the company directly markets gcs  the company will be obligated to pay elan a percentage on the net sales of gcs however  all such payments on net revenues or net sales  if any  due to elan will be offset by certain development costs incurred by the company between the date of termination of the joint venture december  and the date the company enters into a partnering or other commercialization agreement 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure and market risk market risk the company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates as well as changes in currency exchange rates as measured against the us dollar and each other which could positively or negatively affect results of operations and retained earnings 
as of december   the company has evaluated its risk and determined that any exposure to currency exchange is not significant to the company s overall consolidated financial results 
there can be no assurance that the company s exposure will remain at these levels  especially in the event of significant and sudden fluctuations in the value of local currencies 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
interest rate sensitivity the company maintains short term investments in an overnight money market account comprised of us treasury bills 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels that existed at december   the fair value of the portfolio would change by an immaterial amount 
certain factors that may affect future results you should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
in such case  the trading price of our common stock could decline  and you may lose all or part of your investment 
we have experienced significant losses throughout our history  we expect these losses to continue and we may not achieve profitability in the future 
we began operations in and have not generated revenue from human therapeutic products 
we do not expect to generate product revenue for several years  if at all 
we will not generate significant funds unless we receive payments in connection with any potential licensing  marketing or other partnering arrangement with other pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies  or we bring pharmaceutical products to market 
excluding dividends accreted to preferred stock  we have incurred approximately million of losses since our inception  including approximately million for the year ended december  extensive losses can be expected to continue for the foreseeable future 
we also expect to continue to incur significant operating expenses and capital expenditures and anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially in the foreseeable future as we conduct clinical trials  conduct research and development on existing and new product candidates  make milestone and royalty payments  seek regulatory approvals for our product candidates  commercialize our product candidates  if approved  prosecute and maintain existing and future patent applications and patents  hire additional clinical  scientific and management personnel  add operational  financial and management information systems and personnel  and identify and potentially in license additional compounds or product candidates 
we may not be able to obtain additional funding  which could reduce our ability to fund  expand or continue operations 
we believe that our existing funds will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital requirements into the third quarter of  allowing us to conduct the phase i dose escalation monotherapy trial  with a low ethanol formulation of gcs we intend to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities to support our additional planned phase i dose escalation trials and continued operations 
to the extent we are unable to raise sufficient funding for the additional phase i dose escalation trials in the capital markets  we will need to accelerate our efforts to repartner with a large biotechnology or pharmaceutical company and or curtail our development efforts 
our future is dependent on our ability to obtain additional financing to fund our operations 
we expect to incur substantial additional operating costs  including costs related to ongoing research and development activities  manufacturing  preclinical studies and clinical trials 
additional equity financing may result in dilution to our stockholders 
at our current stock price or if the market price of our common stock declines  some potential investors may either refuse to offer us any financing or will offer financing at unacceptable rates or on unfavorable terms 
if we are unable to obtain financing necessary to fund our operations  we may have to sell or liquidate glycogenesys or significantly reduce  curtail or cease our operations 
we have received a going concern opinion from our independent auditors 
our consolidated financial statements included in our annual report on form k for the year ended december  have been prepared on the assumption that we will continue as a going concern 
deloitte touche llp issued a report dated march  that includes an explanatory paragraph stating that our recurring losses from operations  accumulated deficit of million as of december   and our expectation that we will incur substantial additional operating costs  including costs related to ongoing research and development activities  preclinical studies and clinical trials  among other things  raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
our future prospects are heavily dependent on the results of gcs while we seek to increase our portfolio of potential products  currently we are not developing a wide array of products 
nearly all of our attention and resources are directed to the development of gcs if gcs is ultimately ineffective in treating cancer  does not receive the necessary regulatory approvals or does not obtain commercial acceptance  we will be materially harmed 
we are dependent on the successful outcome of clinical trials for gcs gcs is not currently approved for sale by the fda or by any other regulatory agency in the world  and gcs may never receive approval for sale or become commercially viable 
before obtaining regulatory approval for sale  gcs or another product candidate will be subjected to extensive preclinical and clinical testing to demonstrate safety and efficacy for a particular indication for humans in addition to meeting other regulatory standards 
our success will depend on the successful outcome of our clinical trials with gcs there are a number of difficulties and risks associated with clinical trials 
the possibility exists that we may discover that gcs or another product candidate may cause  alone or in combination with another therapy  harmful side effects  we may discover that gcs or another product candidate  alone or in combination with another therapy  does not exhibit the expected therapeutic results in humans  results from early trials may not be statistically significant or predictive of results that will be obtained from large scale  advanced clinical trials  we or the fda may suspend the clinical trials of gcs or another product candidate  patient recruitment may be slower than expected  patients may drop out of our clinical trials  and we may be unable to timely produce sufficient supplies of gcs or another product candidate for clinical trials 
given the uncertainty surrounding the regulatory and clinical trial process  we may not be able to develop safety  efficacy or manufacturing data necessary for approval of gcs or another product candidate 
in addition  even if we receive approval  such approval may be limited in scope and hurt the commercial viability of such product 
if we are unable to successfully obtain approval of and commercialize any product candidate  this would materially harm our business  impair our ability to generate revenues and adversely impact our stock price 
our ability to develop gcs may be harmed if we are unable to find a new development partner 
on december   we and eis mutually terminated our joint venture and we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of safescience newco 
safescience newco received a total of approximately million of research funds over the course of our joint venture with eis 
we must either fund the development of gcs ourselves or with a new development partner 
if we are unable to find a development partner  our ability to develop and commercialize gcs  and our prospects as a whole  could be materially harmed 
our failure to protect our intellectual property or our infringement on the property rights of others may impede our ability to operate freely 
we rely significantly upon proprietary technology and protect our intellectual property through patents  copyrights  trademarks and contractual agreements as appropriate 
we own or exclusively license issued us patents having expiration dates ranging from to five of these issued patents relate to gcs we own or exclusively license seven foreign patents having expiration dates ranging from to five of these seven foreign patents relate to gcs we own or exclusively license pending us patent applications  of which relate to gcs and pending foreign patent applications  of which relate to gcs as we develop gcs  we may discover more about its characteristics and manufacturing which will require additional patent prosecution 
thus  we continually evaluate our technology to determine whether to make further patent filings 
to the extent aspects of our technology may be unpatentable  we may determine to maintain such technology as trade secrets or we may protect such unpatented technology by contractual agreements 
our unpatented technology or similar technology could be independently developed by others 
in addition  the contractual agreements by which we protect our unpatented technology and trade secrets may be breached 
if technology similar to ours is independently developed or our contractual agreements are breached  our technology will be less valuable and our business will be harmed 
there is always a risk that issued patents may be subsequently invalidated  either in whole or in part  and this could diminish or extinguish our patent protection for key elements of our technology 
we are not involved in any such litigation or proceedings  nor are we aware of any basis for such litigation or proceedings 
we cannot be certain as to the scope of patent protection  if any  which may be granted on our patent applications 
the patents we exclusively license from wayne state university and the karmanos cancer institute and the patent applications we exclusively license from david platt could become subject to a proceeding at the us patent and trademark office to determine priority between them 
our potential products or business activities could be determined to infringe intellectual rights of third parties despite our issued patents 
any claims against us or any purchaser or user of our potential products  including gcs  asserting that such product or process infringes intellectual property rights of third parties  if determined adversely to us  could have a material effect on our business  financial condition or future operations 
any asserted claims of infringement  with or without merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel  or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements  any of which could materially adversely affect our operating results 
such royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
in the event a claim is successful against us and we cannot obtain a license to the relevant technology on acceptable terms  license a substitute technology or redesign our products to avoid infringement  our business  financial condition and operating results would be materially adversely affected 
we depend on technology licensed to us by third parties and if we are unable to continue licensing this technology our future prospects may be materially adversely affected 
we license technology  including technology related to gcs  from third parties 
we anticipate that we will continue to license technology from third parties in the future 
to maintain our license with david platt we must pay an annual license fee equal to the greater of  or of product sales 
to maintain our license with wayne state university and the karmanos cancer institute we must  among other things  pay wayne state university and the karmanos cancer institute up to million in milestone payments   per month until fda approval which payments are offset against future royalties  royalties on product sales and receive fda or equivalent agency approval to sell gcs by january  in february  we received a letter from david platt alleging breach of our license with him and providing days to cure such alleged breaches 
we believe the breaches alleged by david platt are without merit or have been cured  however  if david platt were to succeed in terminating this agreement  we would be materially adversely affected 
see legal proceedings platt license for more information 
the technology we license from third parties would be difficult to replace 
the loss of any of these technology licenses would result in delays in the development of our products until equivalent technology  if available  is identified  licensed and integrated and could materially adversely affect our future prospects 
the use of replacement technology from other third parties would require us to enter into license agreements with these third parties  which could result in higher royalty payments and a loss of product differentiation  or alternatively may not be available 
we expect to remain dependent on third parties for research and development activities necessary to commercialize our products 
in addition  we utilize the services of several scientific and technical consultants to oversee various aspects of our protocol design  clinical trial oversight and other research and development functions 
however  we contract out most of our research and development operations for gcs  utilizing third party contract manufacturers such as hollister stier llc and sigma aldrich  inc to manufacture gcs  incell corporation  llc and pharm eco for assay and other development work and third party contract research organizations  such as glenmere clinical research to perform pre clinical and or clinical studies in accordance with our designed protocols  as well as sponsoring research at medical and academic centers  such as the university of arizona  st 
bartholomew s and the royal london school of medicine  and northeastern university 
because we rely on third parties for much of our research and development work  we have less direct control over our research and development 
we face risks that these third parties may not be appropriately responsive to our timeframes and development needs and could devote resources to other customers 
if the third parties we rely on for manufacturing are unable to produce the necessary amounts of gcs  do not meet our quality needs or terminate their relationships with us  our business will suffer 
we do not presently have our own manufacturing operations  nor do we intend to establish any unless and until  in the opinion of management  the size and scope of our business so warrants 
while we have established a manufacturing relationship with hollister stier laboratories llc and sigma aldrich  inc to provide us with gcs that we believe will provide the capability to meet our anticipated requirements for the foreseeable future  we have not entered into any long term arrangements for manufacturing and such arrangements may not be obtained on desirable terms 
for the foreseeable future  we will be dependent upon third parties to manufacture gcs our reliance on independent manufacturers involves a number of risks  including the absence of adequate capacity  the unavailability of  or interruptions in  access to necessary manufacturing processes and reduced control over delivery schedules 
because our manufacturing process is still in a development stage  any changes made to a final commercial manufacturing process may present technical problems to an independent manufacturer 
third party manufacturers may not comply with fda regulations  or other regulatory requirements relating to the manufacturing of gcs  including compliance with good manufacturing practice  or gmp 
we do not have control over  other than through contract  third party manufacturers compliance with these regulations and standards 
if our manufacturers are unable or unwilling to continue manufacturing gcs in required volumes  we will have to identify acceptable alternative manufacturers 
if we need to change manufacturers  the fda and corresponding foreign regulatory agencies must approve these manufacturers in advance  which will involve testing and additional inspections to ensure compliance with fda regulations and standards 
the use of a new manufacturer may cause significant expense and interruptions in supply if the new manufacturer has difficulty manufacturing gcs to our specifications 
further  the introduction of a new manufacturer may increase the variation in the quality of gcs many of our competitors have substantially greater resources than we do and may be able to develop and commercialize products that make our potential products non competitive 
we face significant competition from firms currently engaged in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries 
gcs  our lead drug candidate  being developed for the treatment of various forms of cancer  addresses large markets  which are already populated with several biotechnology and large pharmaceutical companies 
these companies utilize different drug discovery platforms  including but not limited to small molecules  protein based drugs  liposome technology  and genomics 
the drug development industry is intensely competitive 
according to industry surveys  there are approximately over new drug candidates in development to treat various types of cancer  many of them for multiple indications 
according to the phrma  approximately pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and the national cancer institute are conducting these efforts 
it is estimated that biotechnology companies have more than drug candidates in later stages of clinical development than gcs for acute  life threatening disease  and late stage disease  and that over forty percent of these drug candidates are being developed to treat various types of cancer 
many of our actual or potential competitors have significantly greater financial resources and or drug development experience than we have 
there is no assurance that other carbohydrate based or non carbohydrate based drugs with similar clinical effects to gcs may not be successfully developed by other companies 
a biotechnology company such as ours must keep pace with rapid technological change and faces intense competition 
we compete with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies for funding  access to new technology  research personnel and in product research and development 
many of these companies have greater financial resources and more experience than we do in developing drugs  obtaining regulatory approvals  manufacturing and marketing 
we also face competition from academic and research institutions and government agencies pursuing alternatives to our products and technologies 
we expect that gcs and other product candidates  will face intense competition from existing or future drugs 
in addition  our product candidates may face increasing competition from generic formulations or existing drugs whose active components are no longer covered by patents 
these generic formulations or drugs would present lower priced competition 
in the two cancer types in which we have conducted phase ii a clinical trials  pancreatic and colorectal  there are many drugs being developed 
we believe  based on industry studies there are  including gcs  approximately drugs in phase i  drugs in phase ii  drugs in phase iii or pre registration for treatment of pancreatic cancer 
in addition  gcs  if it receives fda approval for pancreatic cancer  will face competition from existing drugs approved or used to treat pancreatic cancer 
these drugs are fluorouracil fu  eli lilly s gemcitabine gemzar and supergens mitozytrex 
combination studies utilizing new drug candidates and gemzar are ongoing and combination therapies of new drug candidates and gemzar may present future competition 
aphton s gdt currently being evaluated in combination with gemzar in a double blinded phase iii clinical trial 
we believe  based on industry studies  there are  including gcs  approximately drugs in phase i  drugs in phase ii  and drugs in phase iii or in pre registration for treatment of colorectal cancer 
in addition  gcs  if it receives fda approval for colorectal cancer  will face competition from existing drugs approved or used to treat colorectal cancer 
these drugs include genenetech s avastin  roche pharmaceuticals capecitabine xeloda  fluorouracil adrucil or fu  leucovorin in combination with fu  janssen s levamisole ergamisol in combination with fu and pharmacia s irinotecan camptosar  imclone s erbitux 
our competitors may successfully identify drug candidates or develop products earlier than we do  obtain approvals from the fda or foreign regulatory bodies more rapidly than we do  develop products that are more effective  have fewer side effects or cost less than our products  or successfully market products that may compete with our product candidates 
the success of our competitors in any of these efforts would adversely affect our ability to develop  commercialize and market our product candidates 
our businesses are subject to significant government regulation and failure to achieve regulatory approval of our drug candidates would severely harm our business 
the fda regulates the development  testing  manufacture  distribution  labeling and promotion of pharmaceutical products in the united states pursuant to the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act and related regulations 
we must receive premarket approval by the fda prior to any commercial sale of gcs or any other drug candidate 
before receiving such approval we must provide proof in human clinical trials of the safety and efficacy of gcs or any other drug candidates  which trials can take several years 
in addition  we must show that we can produce gcs or any other drug candidates consistently at quality levels sufficient for administration in humans 
premarket approval is a lengthy and expensive process 
we may not be able to obtain fda approval for any commercial sale of any drug candidate 
by statute and regulation  the fda has days to review an application for approval to market a drug candidate  however  the fda frequently exceeds the day time period  at times taking up to months 
in addition  based on its review  the fda may determine that additional clinical trials are required 
except for any potential licensing or marketing arrangements with other pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies  we will not generate any revenues in connection with gcs or any other drug candidates unless and until we obtain fda approval to sell such products in commercial quantities for human application 
reimbursement procedures and future healthcare reform measures are uncertain and may adversely impact our ability to successfully sell or license any pharmaceutical product 
our ability to successfully sell or license any pharmaceutical product will depend in part on the extent to which government health administration authorities  private health insurers and other organizations will reimburse patients or providers for the costs of our future pharmaceutical products and related treatments 
in the united states  government and other third party payers have sought to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for new pharmaceutical products approved for marketing by the fda 
in some cases  these payers may refuse to provide any coverage for uses of approved products to treat medical conditions even though the fda has granted marketing approval 
healthcare reform may increase these cost containment efforts 
we believe that managed care organizations and government health insurance programs may seek to restrict the use of new products  delay authorization to use new products or limit coverage and the level of reimbursement for new products 
for example  the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of together with rule making by the center for medicare and medicaid services could effect drug coverage and payments by medicare 
internationally  where national healthcare systems are prevalent  little if any funding may be available for new products  and cost containment and cost reduction efforts can be more pronounced than in the united states 
if we are unable to enter into agreements with third parties to provide sales  marketing and distribution capabilities  or to create these functions ourselves  we will not be able to commercialize gcs or any other product candidates 
we do not have any sales  marketing or distribution capabilities 
in order to commercialize gcs or other product candidates  if any are approved  we must either make arrangements with third parties to provide sales  marketing and distribution capabilities or acquire or internally develop these functions ourselves 
if we obtain fda approval for gcs or any other product candidate  we intend to rely on relationships with one or more pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies or other third parties with established distribution systems and direct sales forces to market gcs or any other product candidate 
if we decide to market any of our product candidates directly  we must either acquire or internally develop a marketing and sales force with technical expertise and with supporting distribution capabilities 
the acquisition or development of a sales and distribution infrastructure would require substantial resources  which may divert the attention of our management and key personnel  and negatively impact our product development efforts 
moreover  we may not be able to establish in house sales and distribution capabilities or relationships with third parties 
to the extent we enter into co promotion or other licensing agreements  our product revenues are likely to be lower than if we directly marketed and sold our product candidates  and any revenue we receive will depend upon the efforts of third parties  which may not be successful 
our growth may be limited if we are unable to retain and hire additional qualified personnel as necessary 
our success will depend on our ability to retain key employees and our continuing ability to attract and retain highly qualified scientific  technical and managerial personnel 
under our current clinical trial and business plan  we may add over employees during the course of the next two years  primarily technical or scientific personnel  as needs develop 
competition for such personnel is intense and we may not be able to retain existing personnel or attract qualified employees in the future 
our current financial position  limited drug pipeline and small size make it more difficult to compete for such personnel against larger  more diversified companies 
at present  we employ full time employees and one part time worker 
we depend upon the personal efforts and abilities of our officers and directors  including bradley j carver  our president  ceo and interim chairman of the board and john w 
burns  our senior vice president  chief financial officer and a director and would be materially adversely affected if their services ceased to be available for any reason and comparable replacement personnel were not employed 
the biotechnology business has a risk of product liability  and in the event of a suit against us  our business could be severely harmed 
the testing  marketing and sale of biotechnology products entails a risk of product liability claims by patients and others 
while we currently maintain product liability insurance  such insurance may not be available at reasonable cost and in the event of a significant adverse event with a patient such insurance would likely be insufficient to cover the full amount of the liability incurred 
in the event of a successful suit against us  payments and damage to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
even if such a suit is unsuccessful  our reputation could be damaged and litigation costs and expenditures of management time on such matters could adversely affect our business and financial condition 
we are contractually obligated to issue shares in the future  including shares to be issued upon the conversion of outstanding preferred stock and warrants held by eis  which will cause substantial dilution of your interest in us 
as of march   there were outstanding options to purchase  shares of common stock  at a weighted average exercise price of per share and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock at a weighted average exercise price of per share 
moreover  we may in the future issue additional shares to raise capital  acquire other companies or technologies  to pay for services  or for other corporate purposes 
any such issuances will have the effect of further diluting the interest of shareholders 
eis owns  shares of our series a preferred stock   shares of our series b preferred stock and  shares of our series c convertible preferred stock 
each share of our series a preferred stock  series b preferred stock and series c preferred stock is convertible into  shares of our common stock  subject to anti dilution adjustments  except  shares of series a preferred stock which are convertible after december  the series b preferred stock bears a dividend payable in series b preferred stock  which compounds annually 
any accrued but unissued series b preferred stock dividends would be converted into common stock upon conversion of the series b preferred stock 
accordingly  eis could acquire upon exercise of warrants held by it and the conversion into common stock of all shares of series a  series b and series c preferred stock held by it  including accrued dividends as of december  on the series b preferred stock but no future dividends  a total of  shares of common stock 
this amount of shares represents of our common stock outstanding as of march  pursuant to provisions in our agreement with eis  if the exercise or conversion of any of our securities held by eis would result in eis owning more than of our common stock at any time  eis may opt to receive non voting securities instead of common stock 
we must comply with the listing requirements of the nasdaq smallcap market or our common stock may decline and the liquidity of an investment in our securities would decrease 
our common stock could be delisted from the nasdaq smallcap market for the following reasons  among others if the closing bid price of our common stock falls below per share for thirty consecutive business days  if our market capitalization falls below million and we have less than  in stockholders equity  or if the value of our common stock held by our stockholders other than our directors  executive officers and stockholders is less than there are other quantitative and qualitative criteria of the nasdaq smallcap market which if violated could lead to delisting of our common stock 
we may not be able to maintain our compliance with nasdaq continued listing requirements in the future 
we received a letter from nasdaq on august  that the bid price of our common stock had been below for consecutive business days and that we had a day grace period  until february   to achieve a bid price of at least for a period of consecutive business days or face delisting 
in september  we received a letter from nasdaq that we complied with the minimum bid price requirement 
we have on several previous occasions received notice from nasdaq that we failed to meet certain of its listing requirements 
we have been successful in regaining compliance on those occasions 
our stockholders equity was approximately million as of december  our market capitalization was million on december  and was million on march  if nasdaq delisted our common stock  we would likely seek to list our common stock for quotation on a regional stock exchange 
however  if we were unable to obtain listing or quotation on such market or exchange  trading of our common stock would occur in the over the counter market on an electronic bulletin board for unlisted securities or in what are commonly known as the pink sheet 
in addition  delisting from nasdaq and failure to obtain listing or quotation on such market or exchange would subject our common stock to so called penny stock rules 
these rules impose additional sales practice and market making requirements on broker dealers who sell and or make a market in such securities  such as disclosing offer and bid prices and compensation received from a trade to a purchaser and sending monthly account statements to purchasers 
consequently  broker dealers may be less willing or able to sell and or make a market in our common stock 
these rules also require that purchasers be accredited investors  which would reduce the number of investors who could purchase our shares 
additionally  an investor would find it more difficult to dispose of  or to obtain accurate quotations for the price of  our common stock 
as a result of delisting  it may become more difficult for us to raise funds through the sale of our securities 
because the current and potential members of our board of directors could control a significant percentage of our common stock  they could exercise substantial control over us 
the holders of the common stock do not have cumulative voting rights 
our directors  two of whom are executive officers of glycogenesys  own approximately collectively of our common stock outstanding as of march  one of the conditions of the transactions between us  elan and eis required that we expand our board of directors at our annual stockholder s meeting at which time eis could appoint one director 
eis decided not to appoint a director at our annual stockholders meeting but may choose to do so in the future as long as they own at least of our common stock assuming exercise or conversion of convertible or exercisable securities held by eis 
if eis appoints a director  members of the board of directors and their affiliates would own approximately of our common stock outstanding as of march   assuming eis has not converted or exercised any of our securities held by it  and the same number of shares are outstanding at such time as are currently outstanding 
if eis and our directors were to have converted or exercised all of our securities held by them  the members of our board of directors and their affiliates would own approximately of the common stock outstanding as of march   assuming the number of shares outstanding at such time equals the number of shares currently outstanding plus the number of shares issued on exercise or conversion of securities held by eis and our directors 
this concentration of ownership would allow these stockholders to substantially influence all matters requiring stockholder approval and could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control or otherwise discouraging a potential acquirer from attempting to obtain control of us  which in turn could materially adversely affect our stock price 
our stock price could decline if a significant number of shares become available for sale 
as of march   approximately  shares of common stock presently issued and outstanding are restricted securities as that term is defined in rule promulgated under the act 
in general  a person or persons whose shares are aggregated who has satisfied a one year holding period may sell  within any three month period  an amount of restricted securities which does not exceed the greater of of the then outstanding shares of common stock or the average weekly trading volume during the four calendar weeks prior to such sale 
restricted securities can be sold  under certain circumstances  without any quantity limitation  by persons who are not affiliates of glycogenesys and who have beneficially owned the shares for a minimum period of two years 
the sale of these restricted shares as well as the shares registered under our nine effective registration statements  shall increase the number of free trading shares and may have a depressive effect on the price of our securities 
moreover  such sales  if substantial  might also adversely affect our ability to raise additional equity capital 
the price of our common stock has been volatile  which could result in substantial losses by you 
the market price of our common stock  which is traded on the national association of securities dealers automated quotation system nasdaq small cap has been  and may continue to be  highly volatile 
during the twelve months ending february   our common stock has traded at prices ranging from to per share 
factors such as announcements of clinical trial results  financings  legal proceedings  technological innovations or new products  either by us or by our competitors or third parties  as well as market conditions within the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries  may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock 
in addition  the stock market has from time to time  and especially in the last few years  experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations  particularly in the biotechnology sector  which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
current market conditions are particularly unstable and there is a large degree of uncertainty at this time 
in general  biotechnology stocks tend to be volatile even during periods of relative market stability because of the high rates of failure and substantial funding requirements associated with biotechnology companies 
market conditions and conditions of the biotechnology sector could negatively impact the price of our common stock
