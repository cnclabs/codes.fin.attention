the company categorizes its programs into three categories managed  risk sharing  and fully insured 
in managed programs  the company earns service fee revenue by providing management and other services to a client s risk bearing entity  but generally does not share in the operating results 
in risk sharing programs  the company participates with the client or producing agent in the operating results of the programs through the utilization of a captive  rent a captive or similar insured vehicles  which are reinsurance companies and are accounted for under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting and reporting for reinsurance of short duration and long duration contracts

management s discussion and analysis continued agency operations the company earns commissions through the operation of its retail property and casualty insurance agency  which was formed in the agency has grown to be one of the largest agencies in michigan and  with acquisitions  has expanded into california 
the agency operations primarily produce commercial insurance  as well as personal property  casualty  life and accident and health insurance  with more than fifty insurance carriers 
in recent years  the company has derived its revenue from the following sources in thousands for the years ended december  revenues net earned premiums management fees claims fees loss control fees reinsurance brokerage investment income net realized gain on investments specialty risk management agency operations reconciling items gain loss on sale of subsidiary intersegment revenue consolidated revenue the revenue included in reconciling items relates to interest income in the holding company 
significant accounting policies and risk factors losses and loss adjustment expenses and reinsurance recoverables significant periods of time can elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss  the reporting of the loss to the insurer  and the insurer s payment of that loss 
to recognize liabilities for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses lae  insurers establish reserves as balance sheet liabilities representing estimates of amounts needed to pay reported and unreported net losses and lae as of december   the company had accrued million of gross loss and lae reserves compared with million at december  reinsurance recoverables represent amounts currently due from reinsurers on paid loss and lae  amounts recoverable from reinsurers on case basis estimates of reported losses and lae  and amounts recoverable from reinsurers on actuarial estimates of incurred but not reported ibnr losses and lae 
such recoverables  by necessity  are based upon estimates 
while management believes that the amount accrued is collectible  the ultimate recoverable may be greater or less than the amount accrued 
at december  and  reinsurance recoverables on paid and unpaid losses were million and million  respectively 
when a claim is reported to one of the insurance company subsidiaries  its claims personnel establish a case reserve for the estimated amount of the ultimate payment 
the amount of the reserve is primarily based 
table of contents meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued upon a case by case evaluation of the type of claim involved  the circumstances surrounding each claim and the policy provisions relating to the type of losses 
the estimate reflects the informed judgment of such personnel based on general insurance reserving practices  as well as the experience and knowledge of the claims person 
until the claim is resolved  these estimates are revised as deemed necessary by the responsible claims personnel based on subsequent developments and periodic reviews of the claims 
in accordance with industry practice  the company maintains  in addition to case reserves  estimates of reserves for losses and lae incurred but not yet reported 
the company projects an estimate of ultimate losses and lae expenses at each reporting date 
the difference between i projected ultimate loss and lae reserves and ii case loss reserves and lae reserves thereon is carried as the ibnr reserve 
by using both estimates of reported claims and ibnr determined using generally accepted actuarial reserving techniques  the company estimates the ultimate liability for losses and lae  net of reinsurance recoverables 
reserves are reviewed by internal and independent actuaries for adequacy on a quarterly basis 
when reviewing reserves  the company analyzes historical data and estimates the impact of various factors such as i per claim information  ii company and industry historical loss experience  iii legislative enactments  judicial decisions  legal developments in the imposition of damages  and changes in political attitudes  and iv trends in general economic conditions  including the effects of inflation 
this process assumes that past experience  adjusted for the effects of current developments and anticipated trends  is an appropriate basis for predicting future events 
there is no precise method  however  for subsequently evaluating the impact of any specific factor on the adequacy of reserves  because the eventual deficiency or redundancy is affected by multiple factors 
the key assumptions used in management s selection of ultimate reserves included the underlying actuarial methodologies  a review of current pricing and underwriting initiatives  an evaluation of reinsurance costs and retention levels  and a detailed claims analysis with an emphasis on how aggressive claims handling may be impacting the paid and incurred loss data trends embedded in the traditional actuarial methods 
with respect to the ultimate estimates for losses and lae  the key assumptions remained consistent for the years ended december    and discontinued programs during the three years ended december    and  the company took actions to eliminate a limited group of unprofitable programs that were not aligned with its alternative risk management strategy 
the company also established strict corporate program guidelines that identify the following criteria as unacceptable risk taking in the surety line of business  programs with aggregate stop loss provisions  where the client s risk sharing is capped at a specified loss ratio  and programs which lack adequate capital contributed by the risk sharing partner or proven profitable experience 
the underwriting losses associated with these programs were million  million  and million  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
all premiums related to these programs were fully earned during the first half of in addition  at december   the uncertainty of future reserve development on these discontinued programs appears to have been reduced as a result of aggressive claims handling and reserve strengthening 
while the company believes it has adequate reserves  there can be no assurances that there will not be additional losses in the future related to these programs 

table of contents meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued credit risk in its risk sharing programs  the company is also subject to credit risk with respect to the payment of claims by its clients captive  rent a captive  large deductible programs  indemnification agreements  and on the portion of risk exposure either ceded to the captives  or retained by the clients 
the capitalization and credit worthiness of prospective risk sharing partners is one of the factors considered by the company in entering into and renewing risk sharing programs 
the company collateralizes balances due from its risk sharing partners through funds withheld trusts or letters of credit 
at december   the company had risk exposure in excess of collateral in the amount of million  compared to million at december   on these programs  for which the company has an allowance of million at december   compared to million at december   related to these exposures 
the company has historically maintained an allowance for the potential uncollectibility of certain reinsurance balances due from some risk sharing partners  some of which are in litigation with the company 
at the end of each quarter an analysis of these exposures is conducted to determine the potential exposure to uncollectibility 
at december   management believes that this allowance is adequate 
to date  the company has not  in the aggregate  experienced material difficulties in collecting balances from its risk sharing partners 
no assurance can be given  however  regarding the future ability of any of the company s risk sharing partners to meet their obligations 
at december  and  the exposure amount in litigation with former risk sharing partners which is not reserved or collateralized is million and million  respectively 
during the third quarter of  a settlement agreement was reached with a former risk sharing partner that was previously in litigation 
the agreement included receipt of cash and a collateralized note receivable approximating net book value 
as a result of this agreement  exposures in excess of collateral amounts and related allowances have been reduced by million and  respectively 
taxes at december   the company had a deferred tax asset of million  million of which is related to a net operating loss carryforward nol 
realization of the deferred tax asset is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income to absorb both the applicable reversing temporary differences and the nol 
at december   management concluded that the positive evidence  which includes cumulative pre tax income of million for the three years ended december   supporting the generation of future taxable income sufficient to realize the deferred tax asset outweighed the negative evidence of the previous cumulative losses reported for the periods ended december    and  which generated the nol 
furthermore  the current market conditions that supported the cumulative rate increases of since the beginning of is expected to continue 
in addition  while the company had adverse development of million  or of million of net loss and lae reserves at december   loss reserves continue to stabilize with a calendar year loss and lae ratio of for the year ended december  also  the company continues to have alternative tax strategies  which could generate capital gains of million  or utilization of million of taxes 
this capital gain would fully utilize the net operating loss of million at december  from the potential sale of assets and or subsidiaries 
goodwill effective january   the company adopted sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
eliminates the amortization of goodwill 
in addition  the company is required to test  at least annually  all existing goodwill for impairment using a fair value approach  on a reporting unit basis 
also pursuant to sfas no 
 the company is required to test for impairment more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
upon implementation of sfas no 
in  the company is no longer amortizing goodwill 

table of contents meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued the company evaluates existing goodwill for impairment on an annual basis 
the company carries goodwill on two reporting units within the agency operations segment in the amount of million and three reporting units within the specialty risk management operations segment in the amount of million 
the operating results for the reporting units that carry goodwill have historically generated profits and were not impacted by the unprofitable programs that were previously discontinued 
management evaluated the net carrying value of goodwill to determine if there has been any impairment of value 
the methodology used for this evaluation included the review of current market values of the reporting units and annual operating performance 
based on this evaluation  management determined there is no impairment to goodwill 
at december  and  the net goodwill was million 
amortization expense in relation to goodwill in was million 
in accordance with sfas no 
 there was no amortization expense recorded in relation to goodwill in or other intangible assets at december  and  the company had other intangible assets  net of related accumulated amortization  of million and  respectively  recorded as part of other assets 
the company did not have any other intangible assets in during the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of  the company purchased three unrelated agency books of business 
the company will amortize these intangible assets over their estimated lives based on the expected retention of the purchased books of business 
these intangible assets have a weighted average amortization period of five years 
also during the first quarter of  the company completed an asset purchase related to the renewal rights of a book of business 
the total purchase price of this agreement was determined based on a percentage of estimated gross written premium collected by the company 
the actual purchase price is contingent upon actual written premium collected over a three year period 
as of december   the total purchase price was estimated at million  consisting of million of fixed assets and  recognized as an other intangible asset being amortized over a five year period 
at december  and  the gross carrying amount of other intangible assets was million and  respectively  and the accumulated amortization was  and  respectively 
amortization expense related to other intangible assets was  for and  for amortization expense for the five succeeding years is as follows in thousands total amortization expense investments the company s investment securities at december  and are classified as available for sale 
investments classified as available for sale securities are available to be sold in the future in response to the company s liquidity needs  changes in market interest rates  tax strategies and asset liability management strategies  among other reasons 
available for sale securities are reported at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses reported in the accumulated other comprehensive income component of shareholders equity  net of deferred taxes 

table of contents meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued as of december  and  gross unrealized gains on available for sale securities were million and million  respectively 
other than temporary impairments of securities and unrealized losses on investments the company s investment portfolio is primarily invested in debt securities classified as available for sale  with a concentration in fixed income securities of a high quality 
the company s investment philosophy is to maximize after tax earnings and maintain significant investments in tax exempt bonds 
the company s policy for the valuation of temporarily impaired securities is to determine impairment based on analysis of the following factors market value less than amortized cost for a six month period  rating downgrade or other credit event  eg  failure to pay interest when due  financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  including any specific events which may influence the operations of the issuer such as changes in technology or discontinuance of a business segment  prospects for the issuer s industry segment  and intent and ability of the company to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for anticipated recovery in market value 
the company evaluates its investments in securities to determine other than temporary impairment  no less than quarterly 
investments which are deemed impaired are written down to their estimated net realizable value and the related losses recognized in income 
at december   the company had fifty six securities that were in an unrealized loss position deemed to be temporary 
these investments all had unrealized losses of less than 
two investments have been in an unrealized loss position for more than one year  one of which  with a  unrealized loss  has been in an unrealized loss position for greater than months 
positive evidence considered in reaching the company s conclusion that the investments in an unrealized loss position are not other than temporarily impaired consisted of there were no specific events which caused concerns  there were no past due interest payments  there has been a rise in market prices  the company s ability and intent to retain the investment for a sufficient amount of time to allow an anticipated recovery in value  and the company also determined that the changes in market value were considered normal in relation to overall fluctuations in interest rates 
as of december  and  gross unrealized losses on available for sale securities were  and  respectively 
results of operations overview in  the company reported consistent  profitable financial results and continued to achieve operational efficiencies and enhancements 
since raising capital in june  the company remained focused on a systematic deployment of the proceeds with controlled growth of historically profitable underwriting programs 
the company successfully integrated new fee for service agreements and million  or  growth in gross written premiums 
this growth in gross written premiums is related to programs which have long term statistically proven profitable experience and  for which  the company has the underwriting expertise 
with this growth  the company has leveraged fixed costs  and maximized statutory surplus and cash flows

as part of the loan agreement  certain of the company s non regulated subsidiaries guaranteed repayment of the credit facility and the company pledged the stock of its non regulated subsidiaries as collateral 
in june  prior to the revised credit agreement  the company reached a settlement with its lead bank and paid million from the proceeds of the public offering on its then existing line of credit 
this settlement resulted in a gain on debt reduction of  which was to the benefit of the company 
both the term loan and revolving line of credit provide for interest at a variable rate based  at the company s option  upon either the prime rate or eurocurrency based rate 
the applicable margin  which ranges from to basis points above eurocurrency based rates  is determined by the level of the fixed charge coverage ratio 
of all the covenants  the most restrictive covenant is the fixed charge coverage ratio 
the fixed charge coverage ratio  as defined by the credit facility  is the ratio of the non regulated earnings before interest and taxes for the four preceding fiscal quarters to the sum of fixed charges which include interest expense  principal payments payable  stock repurchases  and dividends declared during the period 
any unused portion of the revolving credit as of the date of determination reduces the sum of these fixed charges

the board of directors of the company did not declare a dividend in or the board of directors considers whether a dividend will be declared based on a variety of factors  including but not limited to  the company s cash flow  liquidity needs  results of operations and financial condition 
as a holding company  the ability to pay cash dividends is partially dependent on dividends and other permitted payments from its subsidiaries 
the company did not receive any dividends from its regulated insurance subsidiaries in or a significant portion of the company s consolidated assets represent assets of the insurance company subsidiaries that at this time  without prior approval of the michigan office of financial and insurance services ofis  cannot be transferred to the holding company in the form of dividends  loans or advances 
the restriction on the transferability to the holding company from its insurance company subsidiaries is dictated by michigan insurance regulatory guidelines which  in general  are as follows the maximum discretionary dividend that may be declared  based on data from the preceding calendar year  is the greater of each insurance company s net income excluding realized capital gains or ten percent of the insurance company s surplus excluding unrealized gains 
these dividends are further limited by a clause in the michigan law that prohibits an insurer from declaring dividends except out of surplus earnings of the company 
earned surplus balances are calculated on a quarterly basis 
since star is the parent insurance company  its maximum dividend calculation represents the combined insurance company subsidiaries surplus 
based upon the statutory financial statements  star may only pay dividends to the company during with the prior approval of ofis 
star s earned surplus position at december  was negative million 
no dividends were paid in or the insurance company subsidiaries are required to maintain certain deposits with regulatory authorities  which totaled million and million at december  and  respectively

management s discussion and analysis continued the national association of insurance commissioners naic has adopted a risk based capital rbc formula to be applied to all property and casualty insurance companies 
the formula measures required capital and surplus based on an insurance company s products and investment portfolio and is used as a tool to evaluate the capital of regulated companies 
the rbc formula is used by state insurance regulators to monitor trends in statutory capital and surplus for the purpose of initiating regulatory action 
in general  an insurance company must submit a report of its rbc formula to the insurance department of its state of domicile as of the end of the previous calendar year 
these laws require increasing degrees of regulatory oversight and intervention as an insurance company s rbc declines 
the level of regulatory oversight ranges from requiring the insurance company to inform and obtain approval from the domiciliary insurance commissioner of a comprehensive financial plan for increasing its rbc to mandatory regulatory intervention requiring an insurance company to be placed under regulatory control in a rehabilitation or liquidating proceeding 
the rbc model act provides for four different levels of regulatory attention depending on the ratio of the company s total adjusted capital  defined as the total of its statutory capital  surplus and asset valuation reserve  to its risk based capital 
the company action level is triggered if a company s total adjusted capital is less than but greater than or equal to of its risk based capital 
at the company action level  a company must submit a comprehensive plan to the regulatory authority that discusses proposed corrective actions to improve its capital position 
a company whose total adjusted capital is between and of its risk based capital is subject to a trend test 
a trend test calculates the greater of any decrease in the margin ie the amount in dollars by which a company s adjusted capital exceeds it risk based capital between the current year and the prior year and between the current year and the average of the past three years  and assumes that the decrease could occur again in the coming year 
if a similar decrease in margin in the coming year would result in a risk based capital ratio of less than  then company action level regulatory action would be triggered 
the regulatory action level is triggered if a company s total adjusted capital is less than but greater than or equal to of its risk based capital 
at the regulatory action level  the regulatory authority will perform a special examination of the company and issue an order specifying corrective actions that must be followed 
the authorized control level is triggered if a company s total adjusted capital is less than but greater than or equal to of its risk based capital  at which level the regulatory authority may take any action it deems necessary  including placing the company under regulatory control 
the mandatory control level  is triggered if a company s total adjusted capital is less than of its risk based capital  at which level the regulatory authority is mandated to place the company under its control 
at december   all of the insurance company subsidiaries were in compliance with rbc requirements 
star reported statutory surplus of million and million at december  and  respectively 
the calculated rbc was million in and million in the threshold requiring the minimum regulatory involvement was million in and million in the naic s insurance regulatory information system iris was developed by a committee of state insurance regulators and is primarily intended to assist state insurance departments in executing their statutory mandates to oversee the financial condition of insurance companies operating in their respective states 
iris identifies twelve industry ratios and specifies usual values for each ratio 
departure from the usual values on four or more ratios generally leads to inquiries or possible further review from individual state insurance commissioners 

table of contents meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued in  the insurance company subsidiaries generated certain ratios that varied from the usual value range 
the variations and reasons for these variations are set forth below ratio usual range value company star change in net writings liabilities to liquid assets under investment yield two year reserve development to surplus under company savers two year overall operating ratio under company williamsburg change in net writings investment yield company ameritrust investment yield estimated current reserve deficiency to surplus under the increase in star s net written premium in reflected anticipated growth from premium rate increases  the conversion of existing controlled programs to the company s subsidiary s paper  controlled growth related to select new business  and the renewal rights contract announced in november in addition  net written premium reflected the termination of unprofitable business  specifically in the commercial automobile line of business 
while this ratio continues to show improvement from in to in  it continues to be negatively impacted by the exclusion of the value of affiliated common stocks  as the value of affiliated common stocks is not considered in the ratio 
the average investment yield for was compared to in the current pre tax book yield is and the current pre tax reinvestment yield is 
the decrease in investment yields reflects the accelerated prepayments in the mortgage backed securities  and reinvestment of cashflows in municipal bonds and other securities in an interest rate environment where interest rates are still relatively low compared with recent history 
the two year reserve development to surplus ratios primarily relates to development from accident years and this development primarily relates to previously discontinued programs 
the overall operating ratio on savers in was  an improvement from the overall operating ratio for of 
the two year overall operating ratio was  just above the usual range 
incurred large loss activity on the workers compensation  commercial multiple peril and commercial auto liability lines of business contributed to the high two year operating ratio 
the growth in williamsburg s net written premium related to a managed program that has been converted to an insured program 
this program primarily writes commercial auto liability coverage  which the company has managed since the estimated current reserve deficiency to policyholders surplus on ameritrust was impacted by the elimination of the surplus relief reinsurance treaty in on june   am best upgraded the insurance company subsidiaries financial strength rating to a b very good with a positive outlook 
a positive outlook is placed on a company s rating if its financial and market trends are favorable  relative to its current rating level 
the upgrade reflects am best s positive assessment of the company s improved financial condition as a result of the issuance of new common shares 
table of contents meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued and its debt reduction and indicates the potential for a near term upgrade 
the company believes that as a result of its improved balance sheet and operating performance its rating will remain at least at its current level  if not at an upgraded level 
however  there can be no assurance that am best will not change its rating of the insurance company subsidiaries in the future 
reinsurance considerations the company seeks to manage the risk exposure of its insurance company subsidiaries and its clients through the purchase of excess of loss and quota share reinsurance 
the company s reinsurance requirements are analyzed on a specific program basis to determine the appropriate retention levels and reinsurance coverage limits 
the company secures this reinsurance based on the availability  cost  and benefits of various reinsurance alternatives 
reinsurance does not legally discharge an insurer from its primary liability for the full amount of risks assumed under insurance policies it issues  but it does make the assuming reinsurer liable to the insurer to the extent of the reinsurance ceded 
therefore  the company is subject to credit risk with respect to the obligations of its reinsurers 
in its selection of reinsurers  the company evaluates the financial stability of its prospective reinsurers 
to date  the company has not  in the aggregate  experienced material difficulties in collecting reinsurance recoverables other than those balances related to connecticut insurance company csc and hih america compensation liability company hih in  and for which allowances have been established 
no assurance can be given regarding the future ability of any of the company s reinsurers to meet their obligations

the capitalization and credit worthiness of prospective risk sharing partners is one of the factors considered by the company in entering into and renewing risk sharing programs 
the company collateralizes balances due from its risk sharing partners through funds withheld trusts or letters of credit 
at december   the company had risk exposure in excess of collateral in the amount of million  compared to and million at december   on these programs  of which the company has an allowance of million at december   compared to million at december   related to these exposures 
the company has historically maintained an allowance for the potential uncollectibility of certain reinsurance balances due from some risk sharing partners  some of which are in litigation with the company 
at the end of each quarter  an analysis of these exposures is conducted to determine the potential exposure to uncollectibility 
at december   management believes that this allowance is adequate 
to date  the company has not  in the aggregate  experienced material difficulties in collecting balances from its risk sharing partners 
no assurance can be given  however  regarding the future ability of any of the company s risk sharing partners to meet their obligations 
at december  and  the exposure amount in litigation with former risk sharing partners which is not reserved or collateralized is million and million  respectively 
during the third quarter of  a settlement agreement was reached with a former risk sharing partner that was previously in litigation 
the agreement included receipt of cash and a collateralized note receivable

management s discussion and analysis continued approximating net book value 
as a result of this agreement  exposures in excess of collateral amounts and related allowances have been reduced by million and  respectively 
off balance sheet arrangements on june   the company entered into a guaranty agreement with a bank 
the company is guaranteeing payment of a million term loan issued by the bank to an unaffiliated insurance agency 
in the event of default on the term loan by the insurance agency  the company is obligated to pay any outstanding principal up to a maximum of million  as well as any accrued interest on the loan  and any costs incurred by the bank in the collection process 
in exchange for the company s guaranty  the president and member of the insurance agency pledged of the common shares of two other insurance agencies that he wholly owns 
in the event of default on the term loan by the insurance agency  the company has the right to sell any or all of the pledged insurance agencies common shares and use the proceeds from the sale to recover any amounts paid under the guaranty agreement 
any excess proceeds would be paid to the shareholder 
as of december   no liability has been recorded with respect to the company s obligations under the guaranty agreement  since no premium exists in excess of the guaranteed amount

management s discussion and analysis continued item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates as well as other relevant market rate or price changes 
the volatility and liquidity in the markets in which the underlying assets are traded directly influence market risk 
the following is a discussion of the company s primary risk exposures and how those exposures are currently managed as of december  the company s market risk sensitive instruments are primarily related to fixed income securities  which are available for sale and not held for trading purposes 
interest rate risk is managed within the context of asset and liability management strategy where the target duration for the fixed income portfolio is based on the estimate of the liability duration and takes into consideration the company s surplus 
the investment policy guidelines provide for a fixed income portfolio duration of between three and five years 
at december   the company s fixed income portfolio had a modified duration of 
at december  the fair value of the company s investment portfolio was million  of which is invested in debt securities 
the remaining is invested in preferred stocks 
the company s market risk to the investment portfolio is interest rate risk associated with debt securities 
the company s exposure to equity price risk is not significant 
the company s investment philosophy is one of maximizing after tax earnings and has historically included significant investments in tax exempt bonds 
in the company emphasized taxable securities over tax exempt securities in order to maximize after tax income and the utilization of the net operating loss carryforward 
during the year  the company began to increase its holdings of tax exempt securities based on the company s return to profitability and its desire to maximize after tax investment income 
for the company s investment portfolio  there were no significant changes in the company s primary market risk exposures or in how those exposures are managed compared to the year ended december  the company does not anticipate significant changes in the company s primary market risk exposures or in how those exposures are managed in future reporting periods based upon what is known or expected to be in effect 
a sensitivity analysis is defined as the measurement of potential loss in future earnings  fair values  or cash flows of market sensitive instruments resulting from one or more selected hypothetical changes in interest rates and other market rates or prices over a selected period 
in the company s sensitivity analysis model  a hypothetical change in market rates is selected that is expected to reflect reasonable possible near term changes in those rates 
the term near term means a period of up to one year from the date of the consolidated financial statements 
in its sensitivity model  the company uses fair values to measure its potential loss of debt securities assuming an upward parallel shift in interest rates to measure the hypothetical change in fair values 
based upon this sensitivity model  a basis point immediate increase in interest rates produces a loss in fair value of market sensitive instruments of approximately million  or 
this loss in fair value only reflects the impact of interest rate increases on the fair value of the company s debt securities 
this loss after tax constitutes of shareholders equity 
the other financial instruments  which include cash and cash equivalents  equity securities  premium receivables  reinsurance recoverables  line of credit and other assets and liabilities  when included in the sensitivity model  do not produce a material loss in fair values
