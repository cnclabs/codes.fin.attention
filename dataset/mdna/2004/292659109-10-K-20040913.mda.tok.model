item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies in preparing financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the reported period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the company is impacted by factors such as the continued receipt of contracts from the us government and industrial partners  its ability to protect and maintain the proprietary nature of its technology  its continued product and technological advances and the strength and ability of the company s licensees and joint venture partners to commercialize the company s products and technologies 
warranty liability the company estimates the liability for product warranty costs based upon its past experience and best estimate of future warranty claims 
warranty liability is recorded at the time that the product is sold for sales of photovoltaic products or at the time that revenue is recognized for machine building and equipment sales 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts considering a number of factors  including the length of time trade accounts receivable are past due  previous loss history  the customer s current ability to pay its obligation  and the condition of the general economy and industry as a whole 
impairment of long lived assets the company compares the carrying value of its long lived assets with the estimated undiscounted cash flows or fair value associated with these assets 
if the carrying value of the long lived assets is less than the estimated undiscounted cash flows or fair value  then an impairment loss is recorded 
government contract liability the company s contracts with the us government and its agencies are subject to audits by the defense contract audit agency dcaa 
the company  based on its review of dcaa audit reports  records an estimated reserve for items questioned by dcaa 
we have identified the following as critical accounting policies to our company principles of consolidation  equity accounting and revenue recognition for product sales  royalties  and business agreements 
principles of consolidation and equity accounting the company s investments in cobasys  texaco ovonic hydrogen systems and ovonic media are recorded at zero 
the company will continue to carry its investment in each of these joint ventures at zero until the venture becomes profitable based upon the venture s history of sustainable profits  at which time the company will start to recognize over a period of years its share  if any  of the then equity of each of the ventures  and will recognize its share of each venture s profits or losses on the equity method of accounting 
to the extent that the company has made cash or other contributions  it recognizes its proportionate share of any losses until the investment reaches zero 
the company accounts for its investment in ovonyx on the equity method and has recognized its proportionate share of ovonyx losses to the extent of its investment 
the company has three joint ventures  rare earth ovonic  with rare earth high tech co 
ltd 
rare earth high tech of baotou steel company of inner mongolia  china  for the manufacture of its battery and other related products and components 
the company accounts for its interest in each of these joint ventures using the cost method of accounting 
while the company believes  based upon the opinion of legal counsel  that it has no obligation to fund any losses that its joint ventures incur beyond the company s investment  the company has decided to fund certain of its joint ventures see note g of notes to consolidated financial statements 
product sales product sales include revenues related to photovoltaic products  machine building and equipment sales contracts and nickel hydroxide and metal hydride materials 
revenues related to most machine building and equipment sales contracts and sales related to other long term contracts are recognized on the percentage of completion method of accounting using the costs incurred to date as a percentage of the total estimated costs 
all other product sales are recognized when the product is shipped 
these products are shipped fob shipping point 
percentage of completion revenues from product development agreements that contain specific performance criteria are recognized on a percentage of completion basis which matches the contract revenues to the costs incurred on a project  based on the relationship of costs incurred to estimated total project costs 
revenues from product development agreements  where there are no specific performance terms  are recognized in amounts equal to the amounts expended on the programs 
royalties most license agreements  other than those granted to certain joint ventures  provide for the company to receive royalties from the sale of products which utilize the licensed technology 
typically  the royalties are incremental to and distinct from the license fee and are recognized as revenue upon the sale of the respective licensed product 
in several instances  the company has received cash payments for nonrefundable advance royalty payments which are creditable against future royalties under the licenses 
advance royalty payments are deferred and recognized in revenues as the creditable sales occur  the underlying agreement expires  or when the company has demonstrable evidence that no additional royalties will be creditable and  accordingly  the earnings process is completed 
business agreements a substantial portion of revenues is derived through business agreements for the development and or commercialization of products based upon the company s proprietary technologies 
the company has two major types of business agreements 
the first type of business agreement relates to licensing the company s proprietary technology 
licensing activities are tailored to provide each licensee with the right to use the company s technology  most of which is patented  for a specific product application or  in some instances  for further exploration of new product applications of such technologies 
the terms of such licenses  accordingly  are tailored to address a number of circumstances relating to the use of such technology which have been negotiated between the company and the licensee 
such terms generally address whether the license will be exclusive or nonexclusive  whether the licensee is limited to very narrowly defined applications or to broader based product manufacture or sale of products using such technologies  whether the license will provide royalties for products sold which employ such licensed technology and how such royalties will be measured  as well as other factors specific to each negotiated arrangement 
in some cases  licenses relate directly to product development that the company has undertaken pursuant to product development agreements  in other cases  they relate to product development and commercialization efforts of the licensee  and other agreements combine the efforts of the company with those of the licensee 
license agreement fees are generally recognized as revenue at the time the agreements are consummated  which is the completion of the earnings process 
typically  such fees are nonrefundable  do not obligate the company to incur any future costs or require future performance by the company  and are not related to future production or earnings of the licensee 
license fees payable in installments are recorded at the present value of the amounts to be received  taking into account the collectibility of the license fee 
in some instances  a portion of such license fees is contingent upon the commencement of production or other uncertainties 
in these cases  license fee revenues are not recognized until commencement of production or the resolution of uncertainties 
generally  there are no current or future direct costs associated with license fees 
in the second type of agreement  product development agreements  the company conducts specified product development projects related to one of its principal technology specializations for an agreed upon fee 
some of these projects have stipulated performance criteria and deliverables whereas others require best efforts with no specified performance criteria 
revenues from product development agreements that contain specific performance criteria are recognized on a percentage of completion basis which matches the contract revenues to the costs incurred on a project  based on the relationship of costs incurred to estimated total project costs 
revenues from product development agreements  where there are no specific performance terms  are recognized in amounts equal to the amounts expended on the programs 
generally  the agreed upon fees for product development agreements contemplate reimbursing the company for costs considered associated with project activities including expenses for direct product development and research  patents  operating  general and administrative expenses and depreciation 
accordingly  expenses related to product development agreements are recorded as cost of revenues from product development agreements

upon receipt of the funds  cobasys made million distributions to each of ovonic battery and chevrontexaco as partial reimbursement of legal expenses 
on august   the board of directors unanimously approved management s business restructuring plan to take full advantage of the favorable battery settlement agreement announced on july  and the increasing market interest in solar energy systems and hybrid electric vehicles 
our strategy is to move ecd from a highly successful research oriented company to the next phase of development  which is to commercialize the products we have developed and concentrate on growing sales revenues and equity value in our core commercial businesses with the goal to move the company into a position of having sustained profitability by july the restructuring will increase product revenues while enabling us to carry out major cost reduction measures  including significant reductions in the workforce to right size activities to support our core commercial businesses 
we will manage a reduced portfolio of advanced product development activities and a leaner r d team to grow future businesses 
since the purchase of our partner s interest in united solar ovonic on may   ecd has funded the operating losses and capital needs of united solar ovonic 
with the growth of united solar ovonic s business  it is expected that united solar ovonic will be able to fund its own operations and capital needs in the coming year 
the core commercial businesses on which the company is focusing are united solar ovonic  cobasys  ovonyx and texaco ovonic hydrogen systems 
in november  the company received a total of  in connection with a sale of units to institutional investors 
in january  the company received  in connection with a sale of additional units of its securities to two of the institutional investors who had acquired units in november see note b of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company has been using the proceeds from these sales for working capital and to support its development and other operating activities 
each unit included a warrant to purchase a share of ecd common stock 
warrants to purchase  shares of ecd common stock are outstanding and may be exercised for on or prior to may  and for at any time thereafter but prior to october  the company expects the amount of cash to be received under existing product development agreements in the year ending june  to decrease to approximately  compared to  received in the year ended june   substantially due to reduced funding to be received in the year ending june  from chevrontexaco 
certain of the company s product development and product purchase agreements contain provisions allowing for the termination of such agreements for  among other things  failure of the company to meet agreement milestones or for breach of material contractual provisions 
generally  the termination provisions allow for the company to recover any costs incurred through the termination date 
in the first phase of an equipment supply agreement with rare earth ovonic  ovonic battery has three contracts to supply equipment and technology totaling  to its rare earth ovonic joint ventures in china 
as of june   ovonic battery has received payments totaling  under the three contracts 
ovonic battery has recorded revenues of  for the contracts   less than the cash received 
therefore  in future periods  the company will receive less cash than revenues recognized to the extent of the deferred revenues 
as of june   the company had  consolidated cash and cash equivalents  of which was restricted consisting of money market funds 
it is the company s policy that investments including cash equivalents shall be rated a or higher by moody s or standard and poor s  no single investment shall represent more than of the portfolio and at least of the total portfolio shall have maturities of days or less 
during the year ended june    of cash was used in operations 
the difference between the net loss of  and the net cash used in operations was principally due to noncash costs principally depreciation  and equity in losses of joint ventures  partially offset by a  increase in working capital other than cash 
the company spent  on property  plant and equipment that was placed in service during the year ended june  a balance of  was in other assets at june  which represents deposits and progress payments for property  plant and equipment  all of which is expected to be placed in service during fiscal in total  the company expects to spend  for capital expenditures in fiscal  primarily for manufacturing equipment at united solar ovonic and for leasehold improvements to the company s facilities 
the following table delineates the company s contractual obligations payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt capital lease obligations      operating leases      purchase obligations     total      as part of its long standing strategy  the company has made investments in its technologies  which have resulted in enabling intellectual property and products 
the technology emerging from these investments has enabled the company to finance its operations and growth through strategic alliances joint ventures and license agreements with third parties who can provide financial resources and marketing expertise for the company s technologies and products 
the resultant strategic alliances and joint ventures form the basis for advancement of the commercialization of the company s technologies and products o cobasys llc chevrontexaco is funding an initial amount up to   of which has been funded as of june  to increase the manufacturing capacity at cobasys facilities in michigan and ohio  and for market development and advanced product development 
funding may be cancelled if mutually agreed upon business objectives and milestones are not satisfied 
objectives and milestones were developed four years ago and are no longer relevant 
a new business plan is under review by the management committee and  upon its approval  the committee will establish new business objectives and milestones 
a portion of cobasys funding is committed to an advanced product development contract with ovonic battery 
the company recorded revenues of  for work performed under the contract in the year ended june  and expects to record revenues of approximately  in fiscal o texaco ovonic hydrogen systems llc through june   chevrontexaco has funded  including product and market development 
funding may be cancelled if mutually agreed upon milestones are not satisfied 
a significant portion of the funding has been used for a product development contract from texaco ovonic hydrogen systems to ecd 
the company had revenues for work performed under the contract of  for the year ended june  at its meeting on june   the management committee of texaco ovonic hydrogen systems did not approve the accomplishment of three of the joint venture s milestones 
the management committee will review and determine the satisfaction of these milestones at a future meeting 
the resultant strategic alliances and agreements with major companies have accelerated the commercialization and development of the company s products and technologies 
while the company s business partners have funded most of its product development and commercialization activities  additional sources of cash are required to sustain the company s operations 
the company expects to continue to use significant cash to fund its operations in the coming year and is engaged in a number of activities to raise capital  grow revenues and reduce costs 
management believes that funds generated from operations  new business agreements  equity  including the exercise of common stock purchase warrants  debt financings  new government contracts and the cost containment initiatives  together with existing cash and cash equivalents  will be adequate to support the company s operations for the coming year 
however  the amount and timing of such activities are uncertain 
accordingly  no assurances can be given as to the timing or success of the aforementioned plans  negotiations  discussions and programs 
the report of the independent registered public accounting firm states that the company s recurring losses from operations and need for additional working capital raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern 
the company has recurring losses from operations and is actively engaged in discussions to obtain the needed additional working capital
