item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this report 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
the actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of a number of factors 
overview on august   a wholly owned subsidiary of gart sports company completed a merger with the sports authority  inc in connection with the merger  gart sports company was renamed the sports authority  inc the references made to the entities herein refer to the sports authority  inc formerly gart sports company which includes sports authority or company or we or our or us and its subsidiaries 
tsa refers to tsa stores inc formerly known as the sports authority  inc the merger was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting with gart sports company as the acquirer  and accordingly  the results of operations for fiscal include the results of tsa since the date of the merger 
prior year results  as well as results for the first weeks of the weeks ended january   reflect the former gart sports company on a stand alone basis 
at the closing of the tsa merger  we became the nation s largest publicly traded full line sporting goods retailer  with a presence in most major markets across the united states 
at january   we operated stores in states under the sports authority  gart sports  oshman s and sportmart brand names 
we also have a licensing agreement with mega sports to operate stores in japan under the sports authority name 
we believe that our geographic dispersion will benefit top line sales due to sales of licensed apparel in a broader number of professional team markets  and balancing of seasonal and weather fluctuations  among other factors 
in  our efforts were focused on integrating the systems  processes and cultures of the two organizations  while ensuring the continuous flow of merchandise to our stores to maintain top line sales 
comparable store sales for the post merger weeks ended january  were slightly positive  a favorable indication that sales volumes were maintained during the merger integration process 
we also expect the tsa merger to provide us with synergistic benefits in gross margin as a result of reduced inventory costs and increased vendor entitlements 
additionally  we expect to realize significant cost savings from eliminating redundant back office functions 
in  our focus will be on increasing sales through a number of initiatives  including improving in stock positions and rationalizing our merchandise assortment across the chain  growing the ski and snowboard business in the northeastern sports authority stores  remodeling a significant number of sports authority stores to create a more appealing  customer friendly environment  realigning stores among the six distribution centers to reduce in transit time  remodeling the sports authority distribution centers and improving information systems to increase product flow through and data integrity  and continued new store development  with new stores and two relocations planned for the year 
in addition  we expect that the closure of a number of underperforming or overlapping sports authority stores will enhance our profitability  as negative contributors are eliminated from operating results 
we identified sports authority stores for closure as part of the merger integration process  of which eleven were closed and two relocated as of january  we expect to close the remaining stores identified for closure within the next to months 
the implementation of these initiatives will require significant capital expenditures  which we estimate will approximate million in fiscal  and working capital to fund closed store lease obligations 
we believe that our operating cash flows and the availability under our million revolving credit facility provide the liquidity required for these initiatives 
given the economic characteristics of our store formats  the similar nature of the products sold  the type of customer and method of distribution  our operations are aggregated in one reportable segment as defined by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 disclosure about segments of an enterprise and related information 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated  certain income and expense items expressed as a percentage of net sales and the number of stores open at the end of each period dollars rounded to millions fiscal fiscal fiscal dollars dollars dollars net sales   cost of goods sold  buying  distribution and occupancy  gross profit operating expenses merger integration costs operating income interest expense other income  net income before income taxes income tax expense net income number of stores at end of period we consider cost of goods sold to include the direct cost of merchandise  plus certain costs associated with procurement  warehousing  handling and distribution 
in addition to the full cost of inventory  cost of goods sold includes related occupancy costs and amortization and depreciation of leasehold improvements and rental equipment 
operating expenses include controllable and non controllable store expenses except occupancy  non store expenses and depreciation and amortization not associated with cost of goods sold 
fiscal as compared to fiscal net sales 
net sales increased million  or  to  million in fiscal  compared to  million in fiscal the sales increase reflects the inclusion of million in sales from tsa stores from august   the merger date  versus results for gart sports on a stand alone basis in fiscal additionally  non comparable sales for gart on a stand alone basis increased million  net  reflecting an increase from store openings in fiscal and fiscal of million  offset by a decrease of million  primarily from store closings 
comparable store sales in fiscal  which includes tsa stores since august   decreased  primarily due to a first quarter decline of for gart on a stand alone basis 
the first quarter was impacted by a comparison to increased sales from the salt lake city winter olympics in and a decrease in sales due to a major snowstorm in the denver area in  among other factors 
sales performance improved thereafter  with relatively flat comparable store sales in the second and fourth quarters  and a increase in the third quarter 
focusing on results for the company following the tsa merger  comparable store sales increased million or for the last half of the fiscal year 
the increase resulted from a positive performance in the team sports  hunting and camping categories  and by strong sales in the ski  snowboard and snow apparel categories in sports authority locations in the northeast 
the northeast stores benefited from an expanded product offering in these categories  as the broader assortment available in gart stores was introduced into sports authority cold weather markets 
in aggregate  these factors produced a million or increase in comparable store sales 
partially offsetting these gains were declines in the fitness equipment  trends gifts and skate categories aggregating million or decrease in comp store sales 
gross profit 
gross profit for fiscal was million  or of net sales  as compared to million  or of net sales  for fiscal the increase as a percent of net sales reflected improved merchandise margins for the combined companies as a result of lower inventory costs 
gart sports results also improved on a stand alone basis over the prior year  with an increase in merchandise margins of of net sales 
the increase reflects a somewhat less promotional selling environment in fiscal than in the prior year combined with reduced inventory costs  which produced improvements in merchandise margin rates in a number of categories 
these categories include fitness equipment  snowboards  hunting and camping  which produced a combined increase in merchandise margin rates of basis points 
in addition  the application of eitf consensus no 
 accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor eitf resulted in the recharacterization of million of vendor allowances  from a reduction of advertising expense to a reduction of the cost of inventory purchased  of which million  or of net sales  was recognized in cost of goods sold in fiscal operating expenses 
operating expenses in fiscal were million  or of net sales  compared to million  or of net sales  for fiscal the increase in operating expense dollars primarily reflects the store operating costs associated with tsa stores acquired on august  operating expenses also increased as a percent of sales due to the following factors i tsa stores overall operating expenses historically trended higher than gart s 
tsa stores selling  general and administrative expenses were  and of net sales in  an  compared to gart s operating expenses of of net sales for each of fiscal and  and of net sales for fiscal the implementation of consistent operating procedures for the combined company is an ongoing process that we expect to have completed by the end of fiscal ii the higher level of general and administrative costs as a result of the tsa merger  including insurance costs  which increased million  and corporate office rent  which increased million due to additional leased office space to accommodate our larger corporate offices  iii the recharacterization of million  or of net sales  of cooperative advertising monies from a reduction of advertising expense to a reduction of inventory costs as required by eitf  and iv establishing a reserve for the settlement of wage and hour class action lawsuits in california totaling million  including attorney fees and expenses  recorded in the first quarter of merger integration costs 
merger integration costs for fiscal were million  or of net sales  and were related to the tsa merger 
integration costs include only non recurring  incremental costs arising as a direct result of integrating the two companies following the merger 
for fiscal  these costs consisted of million of duplicative payroll  benefits and retention payments  million of severance costs  million of consulting fees  million of expense related to winding up the operations of the tsa corporate office in ft 
lauderdale and closing a gart store in an overlapping market  million for relocation and travel  and million of advertising related to rebranding and announcing the combined company 
operating income 
as a result of the factors described above  operating income for fiscal was million  or of net sales  compared to million  or of net sales  in fiscal interest expense 
interest expense for fiscal increased to million  or of net sales  from million  or of net sales  in the prior year 
the increase in interest expense is related to the assumption of tsa stores debt upon completion of the merger and to financing of merger and integration costs 
other income 
other income was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the increase is primarily attributable to interest income associated with the settlement of the rite aid tax dispute totaling million 
income taxes 
our income tax expense for fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal tax expense for fiscal was offset by a tax benefit of million recorded as a result of the settlement with our former parent regarding an irs examination of our and consolidated federal income tax returns 
excluding this one time benefit  the company s estimated tax rate was approximately for both fiscal and fiscal fiscal as compared to fiscal net sales 
net sales increased million  or  to  million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal sales in fiscal include oshman s results after the june  acquisition date compared to a full year of results for the combined company in fiscal  resulting in an increase of fiscal net sales of approximately million or 
new stores contributed approximately million in net sales  or  for fiscal comparable store sales in fiscal  which included the oshman s stores from august   were flat  reflecting several offsetting factors throughout the year 
in the first quarter of  comparable store sales were strong due to a strong late ski season in our cold weather markets  sales of merchandise related to the winter olympics in salt lake city and increased exercise equipment promotions 
the second quarter reflected a general decline in business  and a significant decline in the camping and hunting departments due to drought and forest fire activity in the rocky mountain region and the western united states 
third quarter sales increases were driven by licensed apparel sales as teams in our markets were involved in the major league baseball world series and playoffs 
however  these increases were offset by a soft selling environment in the fourth quarter of  combined with a mild winter  which impacted our outdoor apparel sales 
gross profit 
gross profit for fiscal was million  or of net sales  as compared to million  or of net sales  for fiscal the increase as a percent of sales is due to a number of factors including a less promotional strategy taken during the year  synergies realized from the oshman s acquisition  systems investments  allowing us to better manage in stock positions  and the addition of key personnel in the buying organization  particularly in the softlines department 
due to the nature of these items  they cannot be independently quantified 
operating expenses 
operating expenses in fiscal were million  or of net sales  compared to million  or of net sales  for fiscal fiscal reflects a full year of operating expenses related to the oshman s stores  while fiscal includes only results after the june   the acquisition date 
as a percentage of sales  operating expenses were flat year over year  due to a continued focus on controlling costs 
merger integration costs 
merger integration costs were million  or of net sales  for fiscal and related to the oshman s acquisition 
these costs include million of duplicative or retention payroll and benefits  million of advertising related to rebranding and announcing the combined company  million for outside consulting services related to the integration  million of costs associated with consolidating and relocating the corporate offices  and the balance principally for other corporate office costs  travel and employee relocation and other personnel costs 
we incurred no further merger integration costs related to the oshman s acquisition since the fourth quarter of fiscal operating income 
as a result of the factors described above  operating income for fiscal was million or of net sales compared to million or of net sales in fiscal fiscal operating income increased million  or of sales  when compared to fiscal operating income excluding integration costs of million or of sales 
interest expense 
interest expense for fiscal decreased to million  or of net sales  from million  or of net sales  in the prior year 
the decrease in interest expenses is related to lower effective borrowing rates on amounts borrowed in  resulting in approximately million in interest savings  a settlement with the irs in the third quarter of reducing interest expense by million  and an increase to interest expense of million due to an overall higher average debt balance  resulting from a decrease in the average debt as a result of the net proceeds from the may common stock offering  offset by the increased average debt due to the acquisition of oshman s on june  and the shares repurchased under the common share repurchase program 
other income 
other income was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the decrease is primarily attributable to non recurring items recorded in fiscal  including million of income related to a consulting services agreement  million of income recognized on the sales of marketable securities  and a one time gain of million on the sale of certain assets that were held in edmonton  alberta  canada 
these items were offset primarily by increased sales tax handling income in the current year of approximately million  due to increased sales volume as a result of the acquisition of oshman s 
income taxes 
our income tax expense for fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal our effective tax rate for fiscal was compared to in fiscal  reflecting changes in certain permanent tax differences as compared to fiscal liquidity and capital resources our primary capital requirements are for inventory and other seasonal working capital needs  capital improvements  including investments in store remodeling  store fixtures and ongoing infrastructure improvements  and pre opening expenses to support our expansion plans 
cash flow analysis fiscal fiscal fiscal dollars in thousands  except ratios cash provided by operating activities  excluding effects of merger and acquisitions    cash used in investing activities    cash provided by financing activities    capital expenditures long term debt at end of period    working capital at end of period    current ratio at end of period long term debt to equity ratio at end of period cash provided by operating activities increased million in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase is primarily due to a higher level of accounts payable financing in fiscal  only partially offset by an increase in inventories  producing a net million improvement in operating cash flows year over year 
additionally  net income adjusted to exclude depreciation and amortization increased by million over fiscal these increases in operating cash flows were partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of million due to increased vendor entitlement receivables 
in fiscal  the increase in cash provided by operations compared to fiscal is due to an increase in net income adjusted to exclude depreciation and amortization 
cash used in investing activities increased million in fiscal compared to fiscal the change reflects an increase in capital expenditures in fiscal of million  combined with tsa merger costs net of cash acquired of million offset by the receipt of million on the sale leaseback of a tsa store site 
additionally  we entered into a second sale leaseback transaction of a tsa store site in january  while the proceeds of million were received on the first business day of fiscal total capital expenditures were million in fiscal  and included million for expanding and remodeling the corporate office and improvements and upgrades to our information and pos systems  million for the development of new or relocated stores  and for stores planned to be opened in early fiscal  and million for refurbishment  remodel and general capital improvements of existing stores 
cash used in investing activities declined million in fiscal versus  reflecting non recurring acquisition costs in fiscal of million related to the oshman s acquisition 
cash provided by financing activities  which typically consists principally of net borrowings or payments under our revolving credit facility  increased million in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase reflects additional borrowings required to finance tsa merger costs and the higher level of capital expenditures in fiscal not otherwise financed by operating cash flows 
proceeds from stock option exercises were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  consistent with the increase in stock option exercises due to acceleration of vesting of tsa options as a result of the merger 
in fiscal  cash flows from financing activities other than stock option exercises were relatively neutral as proceeds from our secondary common stock offering were used to pay down long term debt 
by comparison  financing cash flows of million in fiscal reflected the higher level of borrowings required to finance the oshman s acquisition 
working capital was million as of january  compared to million as of february   an increase of million 
the increase is due principally to an increase in inventories net of accounts payable of million year over year  reflecting additional stores acquired in the tsa merger 
additionally  current deferred income taxes increased million  reflecting tax assets generated in connection with the tsa merger and tax assets acquired from the former sports authority 
our liquidity and capital needs have principally been met by operating cash flows and by borrowings under a revolving credit facility with cit business credit  inc cit  as agent 
upon consummation of the merger  we entered into a new credit financing agreement the credit agreement with cit  as agent  that allows us to borrow up to  limited to an amount equal to of eligible inventory or of the appraised net orderly liquidation value of eligible inventory as defined in the agreement 
we are also entitled to seasonal increases in the inventory advance rate for up to days during any calendar year as designated by us for the lesser of of eligible inventory or of appraised net orderly liquidation value 
borrowings are secured by substantially all present and future accounts as defined in the credit agreement  inventories  trade receivables  equipment  documents of title and intangible assets 
the borrowings mature  absent an occurrence of default under the agreement  on august  the credit agreement contains certain covenants  including financial covenants that require us to maintain a specified minimum level earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization to interest ratios if we do not have at least million available for borrowing in the first year  million in the second year and million thereafter 
in addition  the credit agreement restricts  among other things  our ability to incur additional debt  to merge  consolidate or sell assets  to make loans or advances to others  to guaranty obligations of others  to pledge our assets  to make certain investments  and to engage in transactions with affiliates 
our ability to declare or pay dividends on our common stock and to repurchase our common stock is limited to million per year under the credit agreement 
we are in compliance with all covenants under the credit agreement 
in connection with the credit agreement  we pledged all of the outstanding common stock of our subsidiaries  including tsa stores  inc our principal operating retail subsidiary  as collateral for the credit agreement 
interest is payable monthly at chase manhattan bank s prime rate plus a margin rate ranging from to or  at our option  at chase manhattan bank s libor rate plus a margin rate ranging from to 
at january   there was million outstanding under the credit agreement and million was available for borrowing 
capital expenditures are projected to be approximately million in fiscal  primarily for the opening of approximately new stores and relocation of two stores  remodeling of approximately stores  principally sports authority stores  completion of a new distribution center in fontana  california  and refurbishment of the existing sports authority distribution centers  and information systems upgrades and enhancements and ongoing sports authority systems integration 
we lease the majority of our store locations and intend to continue to finance our new store construction with long term operating leases 
based upon recent store openings  newly constructed superstores require a cash investment of approximately million for a  square foot store and approximately million for a  square foot store 
the level of capital improvements will be affected by the mix of new construction versus renovation of existing retail space 
we believe that cash generated from operations  combined with funds available under the revolving credit facility  will be sufficient to fund projected capital expenditures  future common share purchases  if any  and other working capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
we intend to utilize the revolving credit facility to meet seasonal fluctuations in cash flow requirements 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments to facilitate an understanding of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments  the following data is provided dollars in thousands payments due by period total within year years years after years in thousands contractual obligations long term debt   capital lease obligations  operating leases  net     total contractual cash obligations    amount of commitment expiration per period total within year years years after years in thousands other commercial commitments import letters of credit   standby letters of credit   total commercial commitments   we have routine commitments under merchandise inventory purchase orders  which vary in amount from month to month depending on seasonality and other factors 
such purchase orders are cancelable by us without payment 
in addition  we have entered into employment agreements with each of our executive officers 
payments under these employment agreements are dependent on these executives providing future services and certain payments are required to be made upon termination of employment by us without cause  as defined in the employment agreements 
these items have not been included in the amounts in the above table 
interest rate and foreign currency risk management we entered into an interest rate swap agreement on june   expiring on june   and entered into a second interest rate swap agreement on december   expiring on may   to minimize the risks and costs associated with our financing activities 
under the swap agreements  we pay fixed rate interest and receive variable libor interest rate payments periodically over the life of the agreements 
the total notional amounts under the interest rate swaps are million  which do not represent the exposure due to credit loss 
our interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges and are considered highly effective  as defined by fasb statement no 
net settlements on the swap agreements are recorded as interest expense 
at january   the fair value of the swap agreements was a loss of  net of the related tax benefit 
the unrealized loss from these interest rate swaps is included in other comprehensive income and is a component of stockholders equity 
our exposure to foreign currency risk is not material 
seasonality and inflation the following table sets forth our unaudited consolidated quarterly results of operations for each of the quarters in fiscal and this information is unaudited  but is prepared on the same basis as the annual financial information and  in the opinion of management  reflects all adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the information for the periods presented 
the results of operations for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results for any future period 
the results for the last two quarters of fiscal year are not comparable to the other periods presented due to the inclusion of the sports authority results of operations  after august   the date of merger 
fiscal first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter dollars in millions net sales of full year net sales operating income loss fiscal first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter dollars in millions net sales of full year net sales operating income amounts reflect the results of gart sports on a stand alone basis for these periods 
amounts include the results of the former sports authority  inc from august   the date of merger 
the fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter 
we believe that two primary factors contribute to this seasonality first  sales of cold weather sporting goods and ski and snowboard merchandise during the fourth quarter are generally strong in anticipation of the ski and snowboard season  and second  holiday sales contribute significantly to our operating results 
as a result of these factors  inventory levels  which gradually increase beginning in april  generally reach their peak in november and then decline to their lowest level following the december holiday season 
any decrease in sales for the fourth quarter  whether due to a slow holiday selling season  poor snowfall in ski areas near our markets or otherwise  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results for the entire fiscal year 
although our operations are influenced by general economic conditions  we do not believe that inflation has a material impact on our results of operations 
we believe that we are generally able to pass along inflationary increases in costs to our customers 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the results of operations and financial condition as reflected in our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to inventory valuation  accounts receivable  the recoverability of long lived assets including intangible assets  store closing reserves  income taxes  self insured reserves and the estimates used to apply the purchase method of accounting to our mergers and acquisitions 
management bases its estimates and judgments on its historical experience and other relevant factors  which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a complete listing of our significant accounting policies 
valuation of inventory we value our inventory at the lower of last in  first out lifo cost or market 
cost is determined using the average cost of items purchased and applying the dollar value lifo inventory method 
our dollar value lifo pools are computed using the inventory price index computation ipic method 
lifo cost of our inventories is then compared to estimated market value 
this assessment of estimated market value is based on the quality and age of merchandise  the rate of sale of merchandise  the quantities on hand  and our assessment of the market conditions 
estimates and judgments are required in the determination of the market value of our inventory and future events  such as changes in customer merchandise preferences or unseasonable weather patterns  could impact the market value of our inventory 
inventory shrinkage is accrued as a percentage of merchandise sales based on historical inventory shrinkage trends 
we perform physical inventories at stores and distribution centers throughout the year 
the reserve for inventory shrinkage represents an estimate for inventory shrinkage for each location since the last physical inventory date through the reporting date 
these estimates are impacted by internal and external factors and may vary from actual results 
vendor allowances we receive certain allowances from our vendors  which include rebates and cooperative advertising funds 
these amounts are negotiated with vendors typically on an annual basis and are  at times  dependent on projected purchase volumes and advertising plans 
the amounts are subject to changes in market conditions or marketing strategies of our vendors  and changes in our product purchases 
we record an estimate of earned allowances based on the latest information available with respect to purchase volumes  advertising plans and status of our negotiation with vendors 
we received million  million and million in vendor allowances for fiscal years  and  respectively 
of those amounts  million  million  and million  in fiscal years  and  respectively  were vendor allowances for advertising costs and were recorded as a reduction of advertising expense  while any remainder was recorded as a reduction of the cost of inventory purchased 
impairment of assets we review long lived tangible and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
future events could cause management to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that the value of long lived tangible and intangible assets is impaired 
store closing reserves prior to december  and the adoption of sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas no 
 we recorded a provision for store closing costs when the decision was made by management to close a store 
in accordance with sfas no 
 for store closing activities initiated after december   the related liability is recorded at fair value when a liability is incurred rather than when the decision to close a store is made 
this will change the timing of recognition for certain exit costs  so that certain exit costs will be recognized over the period in which the exit activities occur 
we also record store exit reserves arising from our various mergers and acquisitions pursuant to sfas no 
 business combinations and eitf issue no 
 recognition of liabilities in connection with a purchase business combination eitf 
under eitf  the costs of a plan to exit an activity of the acquired company are recognized as liabilities assumed in the business combination 
as such  reserves are recorded in purchase accounting for the net present value of projected costs to be incurred after the store closing date 
the costs incurred in connection with store closings primarily consist of post closing future net lease obligations  utilities  property taxes  and employee costs directly related to the store closing 
deferred taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on differences between the financial statement carrying amount and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets are reviewed for recoverability based on projections of future operating results  which dictate our ability to realize the tax assets 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce the carrying value of our deferred tax assets when this amount exceeds the amount more likely than not to be realized 
as of january   we had no valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets 
self insured reserves we are self insured for our workers compensation  general liability and employee medical plans up to a self insured retention amount 
we record a reserve for the estimated cost of both reported and incurred but not reported ibnr claims 
the estimate of our current claim obligation requires significant judgment and is based on specific loss estimates for reported claims  and on loss triangulation estimates of future claims payments  including ibnr s 
reserves are regularly evaluated for adequacy based on the most current available information  including historical claims experience and expected future claims costs 
acquisitions and mergers accounting our acquisitions and mergers are accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
accordingly  the total costs of such transactions are allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values 
the determination of fair values involves the use of estimates and assumptions  which are subject to adjustment in the future 
while we believe that the historical experience and other factors considered provide a meaningful basis for the accounting policies applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements  we cannot guarantee that our estimates and assumptions will be accurate  and will not require adjustment in future periods 
impact of recent accounting pronouncements in april  the fasb issued statement no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities under statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the provisions of this statement are effective for us for all derivatives and hedging activity entered into after june  the adoption of this statement had no impact on our overall financial position and results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
this statement establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
the provisions of this statement are effective for these financial instruments with our fiscal year beginning february  we expect that the adoption of this statement will have no material impact on our overall financial position and results of operations 
in november  the eitf of the fasb issued consensus no 
 accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor eitf 
eitf addresses how a reseller of a vendor s products should account for cash consideration received from the vendor and addresses two issues 
on issue  the task force reached a consensus that cash consideration received from a vendor is presumed to be a reduction of cost of sales when recognized in the reseller s income statement 
this presumption is overcome when the consideration is a reimbursement for specific  incremental  identifiable costs incurred by the reseller to sell the vendor s products  in which case the cash consideration should be characterized as a reduction of that cost when recognized in the reseller s income statement 
additionally  the task force concluded on issue that a refund or a rebate of a specified amount of cash consideration payable only if the reseller completes a specified level of purchases should be recognized as a reduction of cost of sales based on a systematic and rational allocation of the cash consideration offered to each of the underlying transactions that results in progress by the reseller toward earning the refund or rebate  provided the amounts are probable and reasonably estimable 
in its january meeting  the task force amended the transition guidance relative to adoption of eitf to require that the consensus on issue be applied to new arrangements  including modifications of existing arrangements  entered into after december  issue remains applicable to arrangements entered into after november  we receive certain allowances from our vendors  which include rebates and cooperative advertising funds 
these amounts are negotiated with vendors typically on an annual basis and are  at times  dependent on projected purchase volumes and advertising plans 
the amounts are subject to changes in market conditions or marketing strategies of our vendors  and changes in our product purchases 
we record an estimate of earned allowances based on the latest information available with respect to purchase volumes  advertising plans and status of our negotiation with vendors 
we have historically treated certain vendor entitlements as a reduction of inventory costs  while cooperative advertising reimbursements have been reflected as a reduction of selling  general  and administrative expense 
the impact of eitf for fiscal was immaterial and for fiscal was a recharacterization of million from reduction of advertising expense to reduction of cost of inventory purchased 
the net impact of eitf for fiscal was a reduction of net income of million  or per diluted share 
risks and uncertainties integration of the sports authority  inc formerly known as gart sports company and tsa stores  inc formerly known as the sports authority  inc may be difficult and expensive to achieve 
on august   we completed the merger of equals contemplated by the agreement and plan of merger  dated as of february   among gart sports company  gold acquisition corp 
and the sports authority  inc pursuant to the merger agreement  we changed our name from gart sports company to the sports authority  inc and the company formerly known as the sports authority  inc changed its name to tsa stores  inc 
the merger involves the integration of companies that have previously operated independently 
the integration will be a complex  time consuming and expensive process and may materially harm our business if not completed in a timely and efficient manner 
we may not be able to integrate the operations of the companies without encountering difficulties  including possible unanticipated costs  failure to retain key employees  the diversion of management s attention or failure to integrate our information systems 
due to the location of the combined company s headquarters in colorado  a significant number of the members of the management team of tsa stores have not remained with the combined company 
as a result  we may lose some historical knowledge of the operations and business of tsa stores 
additionally  we may not realize the increased revenues and cost savings that the pre merger companies expected to achieve as a result of the merger or that would justify the investment made 
if the benefits of the merger do not exceed the costs associated with the merger  including any dilution to the stockholders resulting from the issuance of shares in connection with the merger  our financial results  including earnings per share  could be adversely affected 
intense competition in the sporting goods industry could limit our growth and reduce our profitability 
the sporting goods retail market is highly fragmented and intensely competitive 
our current and prospective competitors include many large companies that have substantially greater market presence  name recognition  financial  marketing and other resources than we do 
we compete directly or indirectly with the following categories of companies full line sporting goods retailers  traditional sporting goods stores and chains  specialty sporting goods retailers and pro shops  mass merchandisers  warehouse clubs  discount stores and department stores  and catalog and internet based sporting goods retailers 
increased competition in markets in which we have stores  the adoption by competitors of innovative store formats  pricing strategies and retail sale methods  the entry of new competitors in our markets or the expansion of operations by existing competitors in our markets could cause us to lose market share  limit our growth and reduce our profitability 
if we are unable to predict or react to changes in consumer demand  our sales may decline and we may be required to take significant markdowns in inventory 
our success depends on our ability to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to changing consumer demand and preferences regarding sporting goods 
our products must appeal to a broad range of consumers whose preferences cannot be predicted with certainty and are subject to change 
additionally  we often make commitments to purchase products from our vendors several months in advance of the proposed delivery 
if we misjudge the market for our merchandise  we may lose sales or we may overstock unpopular products  which may require us to take significant inventory markdowns 
in either case  our revenues and profit margins could significantly decline and our business and financial results may suffer 
we sell products that expose us to a greater risk of product liability and infringement claims  and our insurance may not be sufficient to cover damages related to those claims 
additionally  we face claims in illinois relating to the sale of handguns before we may be subject to lawsuits resulting from injuries associated with the use of sporting goods equipment that we sell or rent 
among other things  we sell long guns  handguns and air pistols  which are products that are associated with an increased risk of injury and related lawsuits 
we may incur losses relating to these claims or the defense of these claims 
we may also incur losses due to lawsuits relating to our performance of background checks on firearm purchasers as mandated by state and federal law or the improper use of firearms sold by us  including lawsuits by municipalities or other organizations attempting to recover costs from firearm manufacturers and retailers relating to the misuse of firearms 
in addition  in the future there may be increased federal  state or local regulation  including taxation  of the sale of firearms in our current markets as well as future markets in which we may operate 
commencement of these lawsuits against us or the establishment of new regulations could reduce our sales and decrease our profitability 
there is a risk that claims or liabilities will exceed our insurance coverage 
tsa stores is one of thirty three named defendants  including firearms manufacturers  distributors and retailers  in city of chicago and county of cook v 
beretta usa corp 
et al  circuit court of cook county  illinois 
this suit was served on tsa stores in november the original complaint was based on legal theories of public nuisance and negligent entrustment of firearms and alleged that the defendants created a public nuisance by distributing  marketing and selling firearms in the portion of cook county outside chicago knowing or recklessly disregarding that these guns would be illegally transferred and used in chicago to commit crimes

the complaint also sought punitive damages and injunctive relief imposing additional regulations on the methods the defendants use to distribute  market and sell firearms in cook county 
in february  the court dismissed the complaint s negligent entrustment count 
the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint with the court s permission in march  which contained both the public nuisance and negligent entrustment counts 
in september  the court granted the motions of the defendants to dismiss the amended complaint  in its entirety  with prejudice 
in october  the plaintiffs appealed the dismissal of their public nuisance claim to the appellate court of illinois  first judicial district

on november   tsa stores filed a petition for rehearing with the appellate court  which was denied on march  on march   tsa stores joined in a petition by the other defendants for leave to appeal to the illinois supreme court the appellate court s decision reversing the trial court s dismissal of the public nuisance claim  which was granted on april  the illinois supreme court heard oral arguments by the parties on september  and has yet to render a decision 
we are currently unable to predict the outcome of this case 
there is a risk that claims or liabilities with respect to lawsuits will exceed our insurance coverage 
additionally  we may be unable to purchase adequate liability insurance in the future 
although we have entered into product and infringement liability indemnity agreements with many of our vendors  we cannot assure you that we will be able to collect payments sufficient to offset product liability losses 
furthermore  we are subject to regulation by the consumer product safety commission and similar state regulatory agencies 
if we fail to comply with government and industry safety standards  we may be subject to claims  lawsuits  fines and adverse publicity that could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
if our suppliers and distributors do not provide us with sufficient quantities of products  or if conditions in any of the foreign countries where they source merchandise adversely change  we may not be able to offer competitively priced merchandise or the quantities or assortment that our customers demand 
we purchase merchandise from over  vendors 
in fiscal  purchases from nike represented approximately of our total purchases 
although purchases from no other vendor represented more than of our total purchases  our dependence on our principal suppliers involves risk 
we do not have long term agreements with our suppliers and cannot guarantee that we will be able to maintain our relationships with them 
if there is a disruption in supply from a principal supplier or distributor  we may be unable to obtain the merchandise that we desire to sell and that consumers desire to purchase 
moreover  many of our suppliers provide us with incentives  such as return privileges  volume purchasing allowances and cooperative advertising allowances 
a decline or discontinuation of these incentives could reduce our profits 
additionally  we believe that a significant portion of the products that we purchase  including those purchased from domestic suppliers  are manufactured abroad 
government regulations  political unrest  war  changes in local economic or labor conditions  trade issues or interruptions or delays in imports could disrupt or delay shipments of merchandise to our stores and cause shortages in our inventory and a decline in our sales 
if one or more of these factors occur  our business and financial results could suffer 
our comparable store sales will fluctuate and may not be a meaningful indicator of future performance 
changes in our comparable store sales results could affect the price of our common stock 
a number of factors have historically affected  and will continue to affect  our comparable store sales results  including competition  our new store openings  general regional and national economic conditions  actions taken by our competitors  consumer trends and preferences  changes in the other tenants in the shopping centers in which we are located  new product introductions and changes in our product mix  timing and effectiveness of promotional events  lack of new product introductions to spur growth in the sale of various kinds of sports equipment  and weather 
our comparable store sales may vary from quarter to quarter  and an unanticipated decline in revenues or comparable store sales may cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly 
our business is seasonal  and our annual results are highly dependent on the success of our holiday selling season 
our business is highly seasonal in nature 
our highest sales and operating profitability historically occur during the fourth fiscal quarter  which is due  in part  to the holiday selling season and  in part  to our strong sales of cold weather sporting goods and apparel 
any decrease in our fourth quarter sales  whether because of a slow holiday selling season  poor snowfall in ski areas near our markets  or otherwise  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results for the entire fiscal year 
a downturn in the economy could significantly reduce our revenues 
sales of sporting goods historically depend on consumers discretionary spending 
an economic downturn in any of our major markets  or in general  could reduce consumer spending on discretionary items that could adversely impact our revenues and cause our business and financial results to suffer 
general economic conditions are beyond our control and are affected by the impact of an economic recession  unemployment trends  interest rates and inflation  consumer and commercial credit availability  consumer debt levels  geopolitical uncertainty  tax rates and tax policy  the impact of natural disasters  and other factors that influence consumer confidence and spending 
increasing volatility in financial markets may cause the above factors to change with an even greater degree of frequency and magnitude 
we have a significant amount of debt that could adversely affect our business and growth prospects 
we entered into a credit facility at the completion of the tsa merger that provides for loans of up to million 
as of january   we had approximately million of long term debt 
this debt could have significant adverse effects on our business 
this debt makes it more difficult for us to obtain additional financing on favorable terms  requires us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to the repayment of our debt and the interest on our debt  limits our ability to capitalize on significant business opportunities  and makes us more vulnerable to economic downturns 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future  we may have to refinance all or a portion of our debt and or obtain additional financing 
we cannot assure you that refinancing or additional financing on favorable terms could be obtained or that we will be able to operate at a profit 
additionally  the credit facility entered into upon consummation of the merger imposes operating and financial restrictions that may impair our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions or to grow our business 
our business depends on our ability to satisfy our labor needs 
many of our employees are in entry level or part time positions that historically have high rates of turnover 
we may be unable to satisfy our labor needs and control our costs due to external factors such as unemployment levels  minimum wage legislation and wage inflation 
if general economic conditions improve  it may be more difficult to attract and retain quality employees 
as a result  our business may suffer 
terrorist attacks or acts of war may seriously harm our business 
terrorist attacks or acts of war may cause damage or disruption to us and our employees  facilities  information systems  vendors and customers  which could significantly impact our net sales  costs and expenses and financial condition 
the threat of terrorist attacks in the united states since september  continues to create many economic and political uncertainties 
the potential for future terrorist attacks  the national and international responses to terrorist attacks and other acts of war or hostility may cause greater uncertainty and cause our business to suffer in ways that we currently cannot predict 
the military action taken by the united states and its allies against the government of iraq could have a short or long term negative economic impact upon the financial markets and our business in general 
additionally  events such as those referred to above could cause or contribute to a general decline in equity valuations  which in turn could reduce the market value of your investment in us 
because an equity owner of one of our significant stockholders is a member of the board of directors of one of our competitors  there may be conflicts of interest 
green equity investors  lp we refer to green equity investors  lp and its affiliates as leonard green currently holds approximately of our outstanding common stock 
jonathan d 
sokoloff  one of our current directors  and jonathan a 
seiffer  a former director  are equity owners of leonard green  and both previously served on big sporting goods board of directors 
john g 
danhakl  also an equity owner of leonard green  currently serves on the board of directors of big sporting goods 
leonard green does not have formal procedures to prohibit messrs 
seiffer  sokoloff and danhakl from sharing information about us and big sporting goods with each other 
messrs 
seiffer  sokoloff and danhakl may have conflicts of interest with respect to various matters affecting us  including the pursuit of business opportunities presented to leonard green 
leonard green does not have procedures in place that are designed to resolve conflicts arising in connection with its investments in entities that compete with each other 
all potential conflicts may not be resolved in a manner that is favorable to us 
we believe that it is impossible to predict the precise circumstances under which future potential conflicts may arise  and  therefore  we intend to address potential conflicts on a case by case basis 
anti takeover provisions may prevent stockholders from realizing a premium return 
anti takeover provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may deter unfriendly offers or other efforts to obtain control over us 
these anti takeover provisions  among other things allow our board of directors to issue blank check preferred stock without stockholder approval  and establish the rights  including voting rights  preferences and limitations of the preferred stock  establish advance notice requirements for stockholder nominations to the board of directors or for stockholder proxy proposals  permit the board of directors to increase its own size and fill the resulting vacancies through a majority vote of directors  even if less than a quorum  and require that mergers and other business combinations with certain interested stockholders  including any holder of or more of our common stock  be approved by a supermajority of the holders of our common stock that are not interested in the transaction 
section of the delaware general corporate law also imposes restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of or more of our common stock 
these measures could make us less attractive to a potential acquirer and deprive stockholders of the opportunity to sell their common stock at a premium price 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate substantially  which may adversely affect our business and the market price of our common stock  particularly if our quarterly results fall below the expectations of securities analysts 
our sales and results of operations have fluctuated in the past and may vary from quarter to quarter in the future 
these fluctuations may adversely affect our business  financial condition and the market price of our common stock  particularly if our quarterly results fall below the expectations of securities analysts 
a number of factors  many of which are outside our control  may cause variations in our quarterly net sales and operating results  including changes in consumer demand for the products that we offer in our stores  pre opening costs associated with new stores  costs related to the closures of existing stores  litigation  changes in merchandise mix  sales and promotional events sponsored by our competitors  and general economic conditions 
our stock price has been volatile in the past and may remain volatile in the future 
the value of our common stock may decline as a result of this volatility 
the market price of our common stock has been in the past  and may in the future be  subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors such as fluctuations in quarterly operating results  announcements  by us or our competitors  of actual or expected financial results  significant contracts  acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments  changes in recommendations or financial estimates by securities analysts  conditions and trends in the sporting goods industry  and general conditions in the economy or the financial markets 
additionally  in recent years  the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are often unrelated to the performance or condition of particular companies 
such broad market fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
following periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company 
if we become subject to this kind of litigation in the future  it could result in substantial litigation costs  damages awards against us and the diversion of our management s attention and resources 
the loss of key executives could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our future success depends on the continued services of our senior management  particularly john douglas morton  our vice chairman of the board and chief executive officer 
any loss or interruption of the services of our senior management could significantly reduce our ability to effectively manage our operations and implement our key initiatives because we may not be able to find appropriate replacements for our senior management should the need arise 
if we were to lose any key senior management  our business could be materially adversely affected 
we rely on our information systems to operate our business  and if our information systems fail to adequately perform these functions  our business and financial results could be adversely affected 
the efficient operation of our business is dependent on the successful integration and operation of our information systems 
in particular  we rely on our information systems to manage effectively our sales  warehousing  distribution  merchandise planning and replenishment and to optimize our overall inventory levels 
most of our information systems are centrally located at our headquarters  with offsite backup at other locations 
following the tsa merger  we continue to focus on the integration of the warehouse management systems and store point of sale systems 
some of our systems have not been fully implemented and require additional configuration  testing and user training before they become fully operational 
systems integration issues are complex  time consuming and expensive 
the failure to integrate successfully our information systems or their failure to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business  lead to unanticipated costs  adversely affect our revenues and cause our business and financial results to suffer 
a disruption in the operation of our distribution centers would affect our ability to deliver merchandise to our stores  which could impact adversely our revenues and harm our business and financial results 
most of our merchandise is shipped by our vendors to a limited number of distribution centers 
our distribution centers receive and allocate merchandise to our stores 
events such as fire or other catastrophic events  any malfunction or disruption of our centralized information systems or shipping problems may result in delays or disruptions in the timely distribution of merchandise to our stores  which could adversely impact our revenues and our business and financial results 
our ability to successfully operate the new regional distribution center in burlington  new jersey will depend on the successful integration of our warehouse management systems 
additionally  the success of this and other supply chain initiatives is heavily dependent on the implementation and consistent execution of new processes and the use of new systems capabilities by our merchandising and supply chain personnel 
the new distribution center may not enable us to improve the flow of merchandise to our stores or improve our inventory management 
lack of available retail store sites on terms acceptable to us  rising real estate prices and other costs and risks relating to new store openings could severely limit our growth opportunities 
our strategy includes opening stores in new and existing markets 
we must successfully choose store sites  execute favorable real estate transactions on terms that are acceptable to us  hire competent personnel and effectively open and operate these new stores 
our plans to increase the number of our retail stores will depend in part on the availability of existing retail stores or store sites 
we may not have stores or sites available to us for purchase or lease  or available on terms acceptable to us 
if additional retail store sites are unavailable on acceptable terms  we may not be able to carry out a significant part of our growth strategy 
rising real estate costs and acquisition  construction and development costs could also inhibit our ability to grow 
if we fail to locate desirable sites  obtain lease rights to these sites on terms acceptable to us  hire adequate personnel and open and effectively operate these new stores  our financial performance could be adversely affected 
we may pursue strategic acquisitions  which could have an adverse impact on our business 
we may from time to time acquire complementary companies or businesses 
acquisitions may result in difficulties in assimilating acquired companies  and may result in the diversion of our capital and our management s attention from other business issues and opportunities 
we may not be able to successfully integrate operations that we acquire  including their personnel  financial systems  distribution  operations and general store operating procedures 
if we fail to successfully integrate acquisitions  our business could suffer 
in addition  the integration of any acquired business  and their financial results  into ours may adversely affect our operating results 
we currently do not have any agreements with respect to any such acquisitions 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary interest rate risk exposure results from our long term debt agreement 
our long term debt bears interest at variable rates that are tied to either the us prime rate or libor at the time of the borrowing 
we maintain portions of our debt in libor traunches that mature in one to nine months 
as those traunches mature  the interest rates on our outstanding borrowings are changed to reflect current prime or libor rates 
therefore  our interest expense changes as the prime or libor market rates change 
we have entered into two interest rate swap instruments  designated as cash flow hedges  as shown in the following table date entered into rate paid rate received notional amount fair value at june  mo 
us libor   december  mo 
us libor   based on our overall interest rate exposure at january   a hypothetical instantaneous increase or decrease of one percentage point in interest rates applied to borrowings under our revolving credit facility would change our after tax earnings by approximately million over a month period prior to considering the effects of our interest rate swaps 
our exposure to foreign currency exchange rates is limited because we do not operate any stores outside of the united states 
we do not consider the market risk exposure relating to foreign currency exchange to be material 
foreign currency fluctuations did not have a material impact on us during the quarter or year to date periods in fiscal  or
