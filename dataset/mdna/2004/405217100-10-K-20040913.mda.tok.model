o on december   we acquired lima nv  the leading belgian natural and organic food manufacturer and marketer 
all of the foregoing acquisitions the acquisitions or acquired businesses have been accounted for as purchases 
consequently  the operations of the acquired businesses are included in our results of operations from their respective dates of acquisition 
critical accounting policies our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the accounting principles we use require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and amounts of income and expenses during the reporting periods presented 
we believe in the quality and reasonableness of our critical accounting policies  however  it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using assumptions different from those that we have consistently applied 
we believe our critical accounting policies are as follows  including our methodology for estimates made and assumptions used valuation of accounts and chargebacks receivable we perform ongoing credit evaluations on existing and new customers daily 
we apply reserves for delinquent or uncollectible trade receivables based on a specific identification methodology and also apply a general reserve based on the experience we have with our trade receivables aging categories 
credit losses have been within our expectations over the last few years 
while two of our customers represent approximately of our trade receivable balance at june   we believe there is no credit exposure at this time 
based on cash collection history and other statistical analysis  we estimate the amount of unauthorized deductions that our customers have taken to be repaid and collectible in the near future in the form of a chargeback receivable 
while our estimate of this receivable balance could be different had we used different assumptions and judgments  historically our cash collections of this type of receivable have been within our expectations and no significant write offs have occurred  however  during the fourth quarter of  we reduced our chargebacks receivable by million 
our chargebacks receivable balance approximated million at june  and june  there can be no assurance that we would have the same experience with our receivables during different economic conditions  or with changes in business conditions  such as consolidation within the food industry and or a change the way we market and sell our products 
inventory our inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost has been derived principally using standard costs utilizing the first in  first out method 
we provide write downs for finished goods expected to become non saleable due to age and specifically identify and reserve for slow moving or obsolete raw ingredients and packaging 
property  plant and equipment our property  plant and equipment is carried at cost and depreciated or amortized on a straight line basis over the lesser of the estimated useful lives or lease life  whichever is shorter 
we believe the asset lives assigned to our property  plant and equipment are within ranges guidelines generally used in food manufacturing and distribution businesses 
our manufacturing plants and distribution centers  and their related assets  are periodically reviewed to determine if any impairment exists by analyzing underlying cash flow projections 
at this time  we believe no impairment exists on the carrying value of such assets 
ordinary repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred 
intangibles goodwill is no longer amortized and the value of an identifiable intangible asset is amortized over its useful life unless the asset is determined to have an indefinite useful life 
the carrying values of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested annually for impairment 
revenue recognition and sales incentives sales are recognized upon the shipment of finished goods to customers and are reported net of sales incentives 
allowances for cash discounts and returns are recorded in the period in which the related sale is recognized 
shipping and handling costs are included as a component of cost of sales 
results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal net sales in were million  an increase of million or over net sales of million in the increase in sales came from volume increases principally in our snacks brands  which were up  our earth s best baby food brand  which was up  our celestial seasonings tea brand  which was up  and from the introduction of our new carb fit brand of low carbohydrate products  as well as sales of businesses acquired in and a full year of our operation of businesses acquired in we believe that sales growth during the current year period was negatively impacted by our inability to fill orders for soup due to non recurring manufacturing issues encountered at our independent soup co packer  thereby causing out of stock positions on soup and  to a lesser extent  by the strike during our second and third quarters of fiscal of grocery workers in southern california where we have a very strong market presence 
gross profit in was of net sales as compared to of net sales in the decline in gross profit percentage was principally the result of the aggressive spending in the trade and with consumers  including spending on the launch of carb fit  as well as increases in transportation costs resulting from higher fuel costs  the cost effects of new regulations on the us trucking industry  and an increase in the percentage of our shipments that were delivered by us 
we also saw increases in the cost of ingredients 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million to million in from million in such expenses as a percentage of net sales amounted to in as compared with in selling  general and administrative expenses increased in overall dollars and as a percentage of sales  primarily as a result of million of additional costs associated with businesses acquired in as well as the full year of operations of businesses acquired in  million of increased consumer marketing to support our increased sales  including our new carb fit line of products  million of added costs relating to the implementation of required provisions of the sarbanes oxley act  and increased costs relating to the management changes that have been made during the second half of our fiscal year 
there were no restructuring and other non recurring charges in during  we recorded approximately million of additional restructuring and other non recurring charges related to the sale of our health valley facility for severance liabilities and related employee costs and trade items that could not be accrued in in addition  at the time of lease termination in  we were able to reduce our potential lease exit costs by million  which was recorded as a credit to restructuring and other non recurring charges in operating income was million in compared to million in operating income as a percentage of net sales was in  compared with in these changes are a result of higher sales offset by the aforementioned decrease in gross profit and increase in selling  general and administrative expenses 
interest and other expenses  net  amounted to million in compared to million in we incurred higher interest expense in resulting from borrowings for acquisitions which were outstanding for the full year in as compared to only part of the year in income before income taxes in amounted to million compared to million in this decrease is attributable to the aforementioned decrease in operating income and increase in interest and other expenses  net 
income taxes in amounted to million compared to million in our effective tax rate was in and net income in amounted to million compared to million in the decrease of million in net income was primarily attributable to the aforementioned decrease in income before income taxes 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales in were million  an increase of over net sales of million in the increase in sales came principally from the net sales of businesses acquired in as well as from the full year of our operation of businesses acquired in net sales in were favorably impacted by the normal winter weather across the united states after the unusually warm winter of the prior year  which provided higher unit sales volumes for tea  soups and hot cereals while the net sales of our terra chips r products experienced declines during the year caused principally by weaker frites r and red bliss r sales 
our sales were favorably impacted by approximately due to the weaker us dollar 
gross profit in increased to million  or of net sales  as compared to million  or of net sales  in the gross profit adjusted for the restructuring and non recurring charges in that year see restructuring and non recurring charges discussed below was million  or of net sales 
the improvement in gross profit as a percentage of sales in came from more efficient trade spending as a percentage of sales and improvements in our delivery and warehousing costs as a percentage of sales  offset by higher ingredient costs and the lower gross profits associated with businesses acquired in europe 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million to million  in from million in the increase in spending in selling  general and administrative expenses came principally from million of costs brought on by businesses acquired in as well as from the full year of our operation of businesses acquired in  million of increased consumer marketing  and increases across all levels of general and administrative expenses to support our growing business 
as a percentage of sales  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased in to from in this decrease was caused principally by the increase in sales at a faster rate than the increase in general and administrative costs as we leverage the infrastructure in place as we acquire additional new businesses and add them to existing infrastructures  particularly in the united states 
operating income increased to million in from million in the amount was reduced by the restructuring and non recurring charges of million in that year 
the increase in operating income came from the elimination of those charges  and from the higher level of sales and gross profits  offset by higher selling  general and administrative expenses  all discussed above 
interest and other expenses  net  decreased to million in from million in this decrease is principally comprised of an increase in interest expense by approximately million in  such increase coming from the increased borrowings during to fund the three acquisitions of businesses we made during the year  offset by the elimination of the million charge we incurred in when we closed the terra chips former manufacturing facility in brooklyn  ny 
income before income taxes increased to million in from million in this increase is the result of the aforementioned increase in operating income and the overall reduction of interest and other expenses  net 
income taxes increased to million in from million in our effective tax rate was in compared to in the small reduction in our effective tax rate came principally from the departure of our terra chips manufacturing facility from new york city and the resulting elimination of the related local income taxes 
net income for amounted to million compared to million in this million increase in net income is primarily attributable to the aforementioned increase in income before income taxes offset by the increase in income tax expense 
restructuring and non recurring charges during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded charges aggregating million  before taxes  related to the expected sale of the manufacturing assets of our health valley r facility in irwindale  california million and the discontinuance of our supplements business million and weight watchers licenses million 
approximately million of these charges were non cash in nature 
during the second half of  we decided to pursue and execute a plan to sell the health valley r irwindale plant 
during the fourth quarter of  we entered into an agreement to sell the manufacturing assets of the facility to a co packer 
our decision to dispose of this facility was largely the result of our inability to reach practical capacity at the facility 
accordingly  we identified a co packer who can produce our products and bring more production into the plant by offering other branded and private label companies the opportunity to have their products manufactured by the co packer 
as of june   with the expected sale of all plant assets and certain inventories to this co packer  we recorded this restructuring and non recurring charge 
the charge included million of charges associated with reduced values of inventories of raw ingredients and packaging  certain lease obligations and other items  none of which included employee severance costs 
of this million of charges  our gross profit was reduced by million charged to cost of sales as required by accounting rules 
at june  approximately million of future costs were accrued  principally related to lease exit costs 
in addition  we recorded million of impairment charges to reduce the health valley r plant s manufacturing assets to their net realizable values 
additional restructuring charges of approximately million were incurred during the year ended june   for severance liabilities and related employee costs and trade items that could not be accrued at june  in addition  at the time of lease termination in fiscal  we were able to reduce our potential lease exit costs by million  which was recorded as a credit to restructuring and other non recurring charges 
through june   approximately million was charged against the health valley r facility charge accrual in the aggregate 
in june  we announced that we had discontinued our supplements business at celestial seasonings r  and that we would not renew our license to sell certain weight watchers products 
these product lines did not represent our core product category of natural and organic foods  and further  the supplements business had faced increasing competition over the last few years along with reduced consumer interest 
our operating results and financial position have been only minimally enhanced in fiscal and fiscal without these non core product lines 
in addition  we can now better utilize our management resources away from these non core product lines 
in connection with these discontinuances  we recorded charges of million related to supplements  principally for inventories  packaging and trade items 
of this million charge  million had the effect of reducing our gross profit 
the charge for the non renewal of the weight watchers license amounted to million  principally for inventories  packaging and trade items  of which million reduced our gross profit 
approximately million had been accrued at june  associated with these future costs 
at june   it was determined that million of the accruals for sales returns and other trade incentives would no longer be required and  therefore  such amount was reversed 
through june   approximately million has been charged against these accruals in the aggregate 
liquidity and capital resources we finance our operations and growth primarily with the cash flows we generate from our operations and from borrowings under our credit facility 
on april   we entered into a new million amended and restated credit agreement the credit facility  arranged by fleet securities  and led by fleet national bank  suntrust bank  hsbc bank usa  keybank and first pioneer farm credit  increasing our credit line by million  and providing us with an accordion feature under which we can request a further increase of million in the credit line 
the credit facility is guaranteed by all of our direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries  and we have pledged some of the stock of our first tier foreign subsidiaries 
we are required to comply with customary affirmative and negative covenants for facilities of this nature 
as of june   we had million borrowed under the credit facility 
this access to capital provides us with flexible working capital needs in the normal course of business and the opportunity to grow our business through acquisitions or develop our existing infrastructure through capital investment 
net cash provided by operations was million and million for and  respectively 
our working capital and current ratio were million and to  respectively  at june  compared with million and to respectively  at june  our improvement in working capital was derived principally from the net income earned during the year ended june  and the working capital acquired in business combinations 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for and million for during and  we borrowed cash to fund acquisitions made during each year 
during fiscal  we received million of proceeds on the exercise of stock options and warrants 
during the year ended june   we acquired 
million shares of our common stock in open market purchases at a cost of approximately million 
obligations for all debt instruments  capital and operating leases and other contractual obligations are as follows payments due by period less than total year years years thereafter debt instruments     capital lease obligations   operating leases      total contractual cash obligations      we believe that cash on hand of million at june   as well as projected fiscal cash flows from operations  and availability under our credit facility are sufficient to fund our working capital needs  anticipated capital expenditures of approximately million  and the million of debt and lease obligations described in the table above  during the next fiscal year 
we currently invest our cash on hand in highly liquid short term investments yielding approximately 
interest

such forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors which may cause the actual results  levels of activity  performance or achievements of the company  or industry results  to be materially different from any future results  levels of activity  performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
such factors include  among others  the following o general economic and business conditions  o the ability of the company to implement its business and acquisition strategy  o the ability to effectively integrate its acquisitions  o the ability of the company to obtain financing for general corporate purposes  o competition  o availability of key personnel  and o changes in  or the failure to comply with government regulations 
as a result of the foregoing and other factors  no assurance can be given as to the future results  levels of activity and achievements and neither the company nor any person assumes responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of these statements 
our acquisition strategy exposes us to risk we intend to continue to grow our business in part through the acquisition of new brands and businesses  both in the united states and internationally 
our acquisition strategy is based on identifying and acquiring businesses with products and or brands that complement our existing product mix 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to o successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates  o negotiate identified acquisitions on terms acceptable to us  or o obtain the necessary financing to complete such acquisitions 
we may encounter increased competition for acquisitions in the future  which could result in acquisition prices we do not consider acceptable 
we are unable to predict whether or when any prospective acquisition candidate will become available or the likelihood that any acquisition will be completed 
our future success may be dependent on our ability to integrate companies that we acquire our future success may be dependent upon our ability to effectively integrate new brands and businesses that we acquire  including our ability to realize potentially available marketing opportunities and cost savings  some of which may involve operational changes 
we cannot be certain o as to the timing or number of marketing opportunities or amount of cost savings that may be realized as the result of our integration of an acquired brand or business  o that a business combination will enhance our competitive position and business prospects  o that we will not experience difficulties with customers  personnel or other parties as a result of a business combination  or o that  with respect to our acquisitions outside the united states  we will not be affected by  among other things  exchange rate risk 
in addition  we cannot be certain that we will be successful in o integrating an acquired brand or business s distribution channels with our own  o coordinating sales force activities of an acquired company or in selling the products of an acquired company to our customer base  or o integrating an acquired company into our management information systems or in integrating an acquired company s products into our product mix 
additionally  integrating an acquired company into our existing operations will require management resources and may divert our management from our day to day operations 
if we are not successful in integrating the operations of acquired companies  our business could be harmed 
consumer preferences for our products are difficult to predict and may change a significant shift in consumer demand away from our products or our failure to maintain our current market position could reduce our sales or the prestige of our brands in our markets  which could harm our business 
while we continue to diversify our product offerings  we cannot be certain that demand for our products will continue at current levels or increase in the future 
our business is primarily focused on sales of natural and organic and specialty food products in markets geared to consumers of natural foods  specialty teas  non dairy beverages  cereals  breakfast bars  canned soups and vegetables  snacks and cooking oils  which  if consumer demand for such categories were to decrease  could harm our business 
consumer trends change based on a number of possible factors  including o nutritional values  such as a change in preference from fat free to reduced fat to no reduction in fat  and o a shift in preference from organic to non organic and from natural products to non natural products 
in addition  we have other product categories  such as medically directed food products  kosher foods and other specialty food items  as well as natural health and beauty care products 
we are subject to evolving consumer preferences for these products 
our markets are highly competitive we operate in highly competitive geographic and product markets  and some of our markets are dominated by competitors with greater resources 
we cannot be certain that we could successfully compete for sales to distributors or stores that purchase from larger  more established companies that have greater financial  managerial  sales and technical resources 
in addition  we compete for limited retailer shelf space for our products 
larger competitors  such as mainstream food companies including general mills  nestle sa  kraft foods  groupe danone  kellogg company and sara lee corporation  also may be able to benefit from economies of scale  pricing advantages or the introduction of new products that compete with our products 
retailers also market competitive products under their own private labels 
the beverage market is large and highly competitive 
the tea portion of the beverage market is also highly competitive 
competitive factors in the tea industry include product quality and taste  brand awareness among consumers  variety of specialty tea flavors  interesting or unique product names  product packaging and package design  supermarket and grocery store shelf space  alternative distribution channels  reputation  price  advertising and promotion 
our principal competitors on a national basis in the specialty tea market are thomas j 
lipton company  a division of unilever plc  and rc bigelow  inc unilever has substantially greater financial resources than us 
in addition  in april  tazo tea company a subsidiary of starbucks corporation and kraft foods global  inc announced a licensing agreement whereby tazo products might gain additional access to grocery channels through placement by kraft  which has substantially greater financial resources than we do 
additional competitors include a number of regional specialty tea companies 
there may be potential entrants which are not currently in the specialty tea market who may have substantially greater resources than we have 
private label competition in the specialty tea category is currently minimal  but growing 
the refrigerated soy beverage market is primarily driven by one brand  silk  which is owned by dean foods and holds a significant share of refrigerated soy milk space through its strong national distribution system 
in the future  competitors may introduce other products that compete with our products and these competitive products may have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we are dependent upon the services of our chief executive officer we are highly dependent upon the services of irwin d 
simon  our chairman of the board  president and chief executive officer 
we believe mr 
simon s reputation as our founder and his expertise and knowledge in the natural and specialty foods market are critical factors in our continuing growth 
the loss of the services of mr 
simon could harm our business 
we rely on independent brokers and distributors for a substantial portion of our sales we rely upon sales efforts made by or through non affiliated food brokers to distributors and other customers 
the loss of  or business disruption at  one or more of these distributors or brokers may harm our business 
if we were required to obtain additional or alternative distribution and food brokerage agreements or arrangements in the future  we cannot be certain that we will be able to do so on satisfactory terms or in a timely manner 
two of our distributors  united natural foods and tree of life  accounted for approximately and  respectively  of our net sales for the fiscal year ended june   approximately and  respectively  for the year ended june   and approximately and  respectively  for the year ended june  our inability to enter into satisfactory brokerage agreements may inhibit our ability to implement our business plan or to establish markets necessary to develop our products successfully 
food brokers act as selling agents representing specific brands on a non exclusive basis under oral or written agreements generally terminable at any time on days notice  and receive a percentage of net sales as compensation 
distributors purchase directly for their own account for resale 
in addition  the success of our business depends  in large part  upon the establishment and maintenance of a strong distribution network 
loss of one or more of our manufacturing facilities could harm our business for the years ended june   and  approximately  and  respectively  of our revenue was derived from products manufactured at our manufacturing facilities 
an interruption in or the loss of operations at one or more of these facilities  or the failure to maintain our labor force at one or more of these facilities  could delay or postpone production of our products  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition until we could secure an alternate source of supply 
we rely on independent co packers to produce some or most of our products during  and  approximately  and  respectively  of our revenue was derived from products manufactured at independent co packers 
in the us  we presently obtain o all of our requirements for non dairy beverages from five co packers  all of which are under contract or other arrangements  o all of our us requirements for rice cakes from one co packer  o all of our health valley r baked goods and cereal products from one co packer  which is under contract  o all of our cooking oils from one co packer  o principally all of our tortilla chips from three co packers  one of which is under contract  o a portion of our requirements for terra s yukon gold r line from one co packer  which is under contract  o the requirements for our canned soups from two co packers  which are under contract  o all of our earth s best r baby food products from two co packers  which are under contract  and o a portion of our ethnic gourmet r products from one co packer  which is under contract 
the loss of one or more co packers  or our failure to retain co packers for newly acquired products or brands  could delay or postpone production of our products  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition until such time as an alternate source could be secured  which may be on less favorable terms 
our tea ingredients are subject to import risk our tea business purchases its ingredients from numerous foreign and domestic manufacturers  importers and growers  with the majority of those purchases occurring outside of the united states 
we maintain long term relationships with most of our suppliers 
purchase arrangements with ingredient suppliers are generally made annually and in us currency 
purchases are made through purchase orders or contracts  and price  delivery terms and product specifications vary 
our botanical purchasers visit major suppliers around the world annually to procure ingredients and to assure quality by observing production methods and providing product specifications 
many ingredients are presently grown in countries where labor intensive cultivation is possible  and where we often must educate the growers about product standards 
we perform laboratory analysis on incoming ingredient shipments for the purpose of assuring that they meet our quality standards and those of the fda and the california organic foods act of our ability to ensure a continuing supply of ingredients at competitive prices depends on many factors beyond our control  such as foreign political situations  embargoes  changes in national and world economic conditions  currency fluctuations forecasting adequate need of seasonal raw material ingredients and unfavorable climatic conditions 
we take steps and will continue to take steps intended to lessen the risk of an interruption of botanical supplies  including identification of alternative sources and maintenance of appropriate inventory levels 
we have  in the past  maintained sufficient supplies for our ongoing operations 
our failure to maintain relationships with our existing suppliers or find new suppliers  observe production standards for our foreign procured products or continue our supply of botanicals from foreign sources could harm our business 
we are subject to risks associated with our international sales and operations  including foreign currency risks operating in international markets involves exposure to movements in currency exchange rates  which are volatile at times 
the economic impact of currency exchange rate movements is complex because such changes are often linked to variability in real growth  inflation  interest rates  governmental actions and other factors 
consequently  isolating the effect of changes in currency does not incorporate these other important economic factors 
these changes  if material  could cause adjustments to our financing and operating strategies 
during fiscal  approximately of our net sales were generated from sales outside the united states  while such sales outside the united states were of net sales in and in we expect sales from non core us markets to possibly represent an increasing portion of our total net sales in the future 
our non us sales and operations are subject to risks inherent in conducting business abroad  many of which are outside our control  including o periodic economic downturns and unstable political environments  o price and currency exchange controls  o fluctuations in the relative values of currencies  o unexpected changes in trading policies  regulatory requirements  tariffs and other barriers  o compliance with applicable foreign laws  and o difficulties in managing a global enterprise  including staffing  collecting accounts receivable and managing distributors 
our inability to use our trademarks could have a material adverse effect on our business our inability to use our trademarks could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we believe that brand awareness is a significant component in a consumer s decision to purchase one product over another in the highly competitive food and beverage industry 
our failure to continue to sell our products under our established brand names could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we believe that our trademarks and trade names are significant to the marketing and sale of our products and that the inability to utilize certain of these names could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our products must comply with government regulation the usda has adopted regulations with respect to a national organic labeling and certification program which became effective february   and fully implemented on october  we currently manufacture approximately organic products which are covered by these new regulations 
future developments in the regulation of labeling of organic foods could require us to further modify the labeling of our products  which could affect the sales of our products and thus harm our business 
in addition  on january   the fda proposed new policy guidelines regarding the labeling of genetically engineered foods 
the fda is currently considering the comments it received before issuing final guidance 
these guidelines  if adopted  could require us to modify the labeling of our products  which could affect the sales of our products and thus harm our business 
the fda published the final rule amending the nutritional labeling regulations to require declaration of trans fatty acids in the nutritional label of conventional foods and dietary supplements on july  the final rule will be effective on january  additionally  an allergen labeling law was passed and signed on august  this law requires certain allergens to be clearly labeled by january  we are in the process of revising our labels to comply with the final rules 
furthermore  new government laws and regulations may be introduced in the future that could result in additional compliance costs  seizures  confiscations  recalls or monetary fines  any of which could prevent or inhibit the development  distribution and sale of our products 
if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations  we may be subject to civil remedies  including fines  injunctions  recalls or seizures  as well as potential criminal sanctions  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
product recalls could have a material adverse effect on our business manufacturers and distributors of products in the food industry are sometimes subject to the recall of their products for a variety of reasons  including for product defects  such as ingredient contamination  packaging safety and inadequate labeling disclosure 
if any of our products are recalled due to a product defect or for any other reason  we could be required to incur the expense of the recall or the expense of any resulting legal proceeding 
additionally  if one of our significant brands were subject to recall  the image of that brand and our company could be harmed  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
product liability suits  if brought  could have a material adverse effect on our business if a product liability claim exceeding our insurance coverage were to be successfully asserted against us  it could harm our business 
we cannot assure you that such coverage will be sufficient to insure against claims which may be brought against us  or that we will be able to maintain such insurance or obtain additional insurance covering existing or new products 
as a marketer of food products  we are subject to the risk of claims for product liability 
we maintain product liability insurance and generally require that our co packers maintain product liability insurance with us as a co insured 
we rely on independent certification for a number of our natural and specialty food products we rely on independent certification  such as certifications of our products as organic or kosher  to differentiate our products in natural and specialty food categories 
the loss of any independent certifications could adversely affect our market position as a natural and specialty food company  which could harm our business 
we must comply with the requirements of independent organizations or certification authorities in order to label our products as certified 
for example  we can lose our organic certification if a plant becomes contaminated with non organic materials  or if not properly cleaned after a production run 
in addition  all raw materials must be certified organic 
similarly  we can lose our kosher certification if a plant and raw materials do not meet the requirements of the appropriate kosher supervision organization 
due to the seasonality of many of our products  including our tea products  and other factors  our operating results are subject to quarterly fluctuations our tea business consists primarily of manufacturing and marketing hot tea products and as a result its quarterly results of operations reflect seasonal trends resulting from increased demand for its hot tea products in the cooler months of the year 
in addition  some of our other products eg  baking and cereal products and soups also show stronger sales in the cooler months while our snack food product lines are stronger in the warmer months 
quarterly fluctuations in our sales volume and operating results are due to a number of factors relating to our business  including the timing of trade promotions  advertising and consumer promotions and other factors  such as seasonality  inclement weather and unanticipated increases in labor  commodity  energy  insurance or other operating costs 
the impact on sales volume and operating results due to the timing and extent of these factors can significantly impact our business 
for these reasons  you should not rely on our quarterly operating results as indications of future performance 
our officers and directors may be able to control our actions our officers and directors beneficially own approximately of our common stock as of june  in addition  two of these directors currently serve as a designee and a jointly appointed designee of an affiliate of hj heinz company  or heinz  which owns approximately of our common stock as of june  accordingly  our officers and directors may be in a position to influence the election of our directors and otherwise influence stockholder action 
our ability to issue preferred stock may deter takeover attempts our board of directors is empowered to issue  without stockholder approval  preferred stock with dividends  liquidation  conversion  voting or other rights which could decrease the amount of earnings and assets available for distribution to holders of our common stock and adversely affect the relative voting power or other rights of the holders of our common stock 
in the event of issuance  the preferred stock could be used as a method of discouraging  delaying or preventing a change in control 
our certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to  shares of blank check preferred stock with such designations  rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by our board of directors 
although we have no present intention to issue any shares of our preferred stock  we may do so in the future under appropriate circumstances

these offsetting items increased gross profit by million 
seasonality our tea business consists primarily of manufacturing and marketing hot tea products and  as a result  its quarterly results of operations reflect seasonal trends resulting from increased demand for its hot tea products in the cooler months of the year 
this is also true for our soups and hot cereals businesses  but to a lesser extent 
quarterly fluctuations in our sales volume and operating results are due to a number of factors relating to our business  including the timing of trade promotions  advertising and consumer promotions and other factors  such as seasonality  abnormal and inclement weather patterns and unanticipated increases in labor  commodity  energy  insurance or other operating costs 
the impact on sales volume and operating results  due to the timing and extent of these factors  can significantly impact our business

consequently  isolating the effect of changes in currency does not incorporate these other important economic factors 
these changes  if material  could cause adjustments to our financing and operating strategies 
during fiscal  approximately of our net sales were generated from sales outside the united states  while such sales outside the united states were of net sales in and in we expect sales from non core us markets to possibly represent an increasing portion of our total net sales in the future 
our non us sales and operations are subject to risks inherent in conducting business abroad  many of which are outside our control  including o periodic economic downturns and unstable political environments  o price and currency exchange controls  o fluctuations in the relative values of currencies  o unexpected changes in trading policies  regulatory requirements  tariffs and other barriers  o compliance with applicable foreign laws  and o difficulties in managing a global enterprise  including staffing  collecting accounts receivable and managing distributors
