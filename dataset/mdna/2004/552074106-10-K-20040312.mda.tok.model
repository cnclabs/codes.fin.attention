for arrangements existing as of january  however  such adoption will likely require the consolidation in the company s financial statements as of march  of the assets  liabilities and operations of certain existing joint ventures  option agreements or land banking arrangements 
because the company already recognizes its proportionate share of joint venture earnings and losses under the equity method of accounting  the adoption of interpretation no 
will not affect the company s consolidated net income 
the financial statements of joint ventures in which the company has a or less voting or economic interest and thus are not controlled by the company and which were created prior to february   and the financial statements of joint ventures which have not been determined to be variable interest entities in which the company is considered the primary beneficiary are not consolidated with the company s financial statements

the development process is anticipated to be completed by mid at which time california lyon will be required under certain specific conditions to purchase approximately one half in value of the lots 
california lyon has a indirect  minority interest in the development llcs  which are the borrowers under two secured lines of credit 
advances under the lines of credit are to be used to pay acquisition and development costs and expenses 
the lines of credit are secured by deeds of trust on the real property and improvements thereon owned by the applicable development llc  as well as pledges of all net 
table of contents sale proceeds  related contracts and other ancillary property 
the maximum commitment amounts under the lines of credit are limited by specified agreed loan to value ratios 
the maximum commitment amount under the line of credit that closed in january first line of credit is million 
subject to specified terms and conditions  california lyon and the other direct and indirect members of the development llc that is the borrower under the first line of credit  including certain affiliates of such other members  each i have guaranteed to the bank the repayment of the development llc s indebtedness under the first line of credit  completion of certain infrastructure improvements to the land  payment of necessary loan remargining obligations  and the development llc s performance under its environmental indemnity and covenants  and ii have agreed to take all actions and pay all amounts to assure that the development llc is in compliance with financial covenants 
the first line of credit matures in january  but may be extended to july  subject to specified terms and conditions 
the maximum commitment amount under the line of credit that closed in march second line of credit is million 
the second line of credit matures in september  but may be extended to september  subject to specified terms and conditions 
although the guarantee obligations of the other direct and indirect members of the development llc that is the borrower under the second line of credit  and certain of their affiliates  are similar in nature to those under the first line of credit  california lyon does not have any such guarantee obligations to the banks under the second line of credit 
however  california lyon has posted letters of credit equal to approximately million to secure its obligations as well as the development llcs obligations to the bank under both lines of credit 
further  california lyon and the other direct and indirect members of the development llcs  including certain affiliates of such other members  have entered into reimbursement and indemnity agreements to allocate any liability arising from each line of credit  including the related guarantees and letters of credit 
delaware lyon has entered into joinder agreements to be jointly and severally liable for california lyon s obligations under the reimbursement and indemnity agreements 
while the reimbursement and indemnity agreements provide that liability is generally allocated in accordance with the members percentage interests in the development llcs distributions  delaware lyon and california lyon may be liable for the full amount of the obligations guaranteed to the banks under either or both of the lines of credit in certain specified circumstances  such as those involving the default  willful misconduct or gross negligence of california lyon 
as of december   the outstanding indebtedness under the first line of credit was million and the outstanding indebtedness under the second line of credit was million 
assessment district bonds in some jurisdictions in which the company develops and constructs property  assessment district bonds are issued by municipalities to finance major infrastructure improvements and fees 
such financing has been an important part of financing master planned communities due to the long term nature of the financing  favorable interest rates when compared to the company s other sources of funds and the fact that the bonds are sold  administered and collected by the relevant government entity 
as a landowner benefited by the improvements  the company is responsible for the assessments on its land 
when the company s homes or other properties are sold  the assessments are either prepaid or the buyers assume the responsibility for the related assessments

contractual obligations the company s contractual obligations consisted of the following at december  in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years senior notes revolving credit facilities construction notes payable operating leases purchase obligations land purchases and option commitments project commitments total inflation the company s revenues and profitability may be affected by increased inflation rates and other general economic conditions 
in periods of high inflation  demand for the company s homes may be reduced by increases in mortgage interest rates 
further  the company s profits will be affected by its ability to recover through higher sales prices increases in the costs of land  construction  labor and administrative expenses 
the company s ability to raise prices at such times will depend upon demand and other competitive factors 
critical accounting policies the company s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and costs and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those which impact its most critical 
table of contents accounting policies 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes that the following accounting policies are among the most important to a portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and require among the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments real estate inventories and cost of sales real estate inventories are carried at cost net of impairment losses  if any 
real estate inventories consist primarily of deposits  raw land  lots under development  homes under construction and completed homes of real estate projects 
all direct and indirect land costs  offsite and onsite improvements and applicable interest and other carrying charges are capitalized to real estate projects during periods when the project is under development 
land  offsite costs and all other common costs are allocated to land parcels benefited based upon relative fair values before construction 
onsite construction costs and related carrying charges principally interest and property taxes are allocated to the individual homes within a phase based upon the relative sales value of the homes 
the estimation process involved in determining relative fair values and sales values is inherently uncertain because it involves estimates of current market values for land parcels before construction as well as future sales values of individual homes within a phase 
the company s estimate of future sales values is supported by the company s budgeting process 
the estimate of future sales values is inherently uncertain because it requires estimates of current market conditions as well as future market events and conditions 
additionally  in determining the allocation of costs to a particular land parcel or individual home  the company relies on project budgets that are based on a variety of assumptions  including assumptions about construction schedules and future costs to be incurred 
it is possible that actual results could differ from budgeted amounts for various reasons  including construction delays  increases in costs which have not yet been committed  or unforeseen issues encountered during construction that fall outside the scope of contracts obtained 
while the actual results for a particular construction project are accurately reported over time  a variance between the budget and actual costs could result in the understatement or overstatement of costs and a related impact on gross margins in a specific reporting period 
to reduce the potential for such distortion  the company has set forth procedures which have been applied by the company on a consistent basis  including assessing and revising project budgets on a monthly basis  obtaining commitments from subcontractors and vendors for future costs to be incurred  reviewing the adequacy of warranty accruals and historical warranty claims experience  and utilizing the most recent information available to estimate costs 
the variances between budget and actual amounts identified by the company have historically not had a material impact on its consolidated results of operations 
management believes that the company s policies provide for reasonably dependable estimates to be used in the calculation and reporting of costs 
the company relieves its accumulated real estate inventories through cost of sales for the cost of homes sold  as described more fully below in the section entitled sales and profit recognition 
impairment of real estate inventories in august  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets statement no 

this pronouncement superseded statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of statement no 
and was required to be adopted on january  statement no 
retained the fundamental provisions of statement no 
as it relates to assets to be held and used and assets to be sold 
statement no 
requires impairment losses to be recorded on assets to be held and used by the company when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of the assets 
the estimation process used in determining the undiscounted cash flows of the assets is inherently uncertain because it involves estimates of future revenues and costs 
as described more fully above in the section entitled real estate inventories and cost of sales  estimates of revenues and costs are supported by the company s budgeting process 
when an impairment loss is required for assets to be held and used by the company  the related assets are adjusted to their estimated fair value 

table of contents fair value represents the amount at which an asset could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties  that is  other than a forced or liquidation sale 
the estimation process involved in determining if assets have been impaired and in the determination of fair value is inherently uncertain because it requires estimates of current market yields as well as future events and conditions 
such future events and conditions include economic and market conditions  as well as the availability of suitable financing to fund development and construction activities 
the realization of the company s real estate inventories is dependent upon future uncertain events and conditions and  accordingly  the actual timing and amounts realized by the company may be materially different from their estimated fair values 
sales and profit recognition a sale is recorded and profit recognized when a sale is consummated  the buyer s initial and continuing investments are adequate  any receivables are not subject to future subordination  and the usual risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer in accordance with the provisions of financial accounting standards board statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for sales of real estate 
when it is determined that the earnings process is not complete  profit is deferred for recognition in future periods

variable interest entities certain land purchase contracts and lot option contracts are accounted for in accordance with financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  as amended interpretation no 

in addition  all joint ventures are reviewed and analyzed under interpretation no 
to determine whether or not these arrangements are accounted for under the principles of interpretation no 
or other accounting rules 
under interpretation no 
 a variable interest entity vie is created when i the equity investment at risk in the entity is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties or ii the entity s equity holders as a group either a lack direct or indirect ability to make decisions about the entity through voting or similar rights  b are not obligated to absorb expected losses of the entity if they occur or c do not have the right to receive expected residual returns of the entity if they occur 
if a entity is deemed to be a vie pursuant to interpretation no 
 the enterprise that absorbs a majority of the expected losses  receives a majority of the entity s expected residual returns  or both  is considered the primary beneficiary and must consolidate the vie 
expected losses and residual returns for vies are calculated based on the probability of estimated future cash flows as defined in interpretation no 
based on the provisions of interpretation no 
 whenever the company enters into a land purchase contract or an option contract for land or lots with an entity and makes a non refundable deposit  or enters into a joint venture  a vie may be created and the arrangement is evaluated under interpretation no 
in order to i evaluate whether the equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional financial support from other parties  ii calculate expected losses  expected residual returns and the probability of estimated future cash flows  and iii determine whether the company is the primary beneficiary  the company must exercise significant judgment regarding the interpretation of the terms of the underlying agreements in light of interpretation no 
and make assumptions regarding future events that may or may not occur 
the terms of these agreements are subject to various interpretations and the assumptions used by the company are inherently uncertain 
the use by the company of different interpretations and or assumptions could affect the company s evaluation as to whether or not land purchase contracts  lot option contracts or joint ventures are vies and whether or not the company is the primary beneficiary of the vie

impact of new accounting pronouncements in april  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 recission of sfas nos 
 and  amendment of fasb statement no 
and technical corrections statement no 

statement no 
prevents gains or losses on extinguishment of debt not meeting the criteria of apb to be treated as extraordinary 
statement no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after march  upon adoption of statement no 
 the company s previously reported extraordinary items related to gain from retirement of debt were reclassified to other income and not reported as extraordinary items 
in november  the financial accounting standards board issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others interpretation no 

the disclosure requirements of interpretation no 
are effective as of december  the initial recognition and measurement requirements of interpretation no 
are effective on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  however  in the case of a guarantee issued as part of a transaction with multiple elements with an unrelated party  interpretation no 
generally requires the recording at inception of the guarantee of a liability equal to the guarantee s estimated fair value 
in the absence of observable transactions for identical or similar guarantees  estimated fair value will likely be based on the expected present value which is the sum of the estimated probability weighted range of contingent payments under the guarantee arrangement 
the recording of a liability could have a corresponding effect on various of the company s financial ratios and other financial and operational indicators 
the application of interpretation no 
beginning on january  did not have a material impact on the company s financial statements with respect to any guarantees issued or modified by the company after december  see notes  and of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the company s guarantees 
in january  the financial accounting standards board issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  as amended interpretation no 
 which applies to arrangements created after january  interpretation no 
applies to arrangements created before february  beginning on march  as of december   the company is considered to be the primary beneficiary in six joint ventures created after january   which have been determined to be variable interest entities 
accordingly  the assets  liabilities and operations of these six joint ventures have been consolidated with the company s financial statements as of december  and for the period then ended 
the company has not yet determined the anticipated impact of adopting interpretation no 
for arrangements existing as of january  however  such adoption will likely require the consolidation of certain of the company s joint ventures  option agreements and land banking arrangements in the company s financial statements as of march  the consolidation of the assets  liabilities and operations of any joint venture  option agreements or land banking arrangements would have a corresponding effect on various of the company s financial ratios and other financial and operational indicators

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to the company s floating rate debt with a total outstanding balance at december  of million where the interest rate is variable based upon certain bank reference or prime rates 
if interest rates were to increase by  the estimated impact on the company s consolidated financial statements would be no reduction to income before provision for taxes based on amounts outstanding and rates in effect at december   but would increase capitalized interest by approximately million which would be amortized to cost of sales as home closings occur
