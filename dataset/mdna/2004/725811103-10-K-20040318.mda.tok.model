item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this section and other parts of this form k contain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that might cause such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in the subsection entitled risk factors in item of this form k 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in item of this form k 
overview pixar was formed in when steve jobs purchased the computer division of lucasfilm and incorporated it as a separate company 
in  we entered into a feature film agreement the feature film agreement with walt disney pictures  a wholly owned subsidiary of the walt disney company together with its subsidiaries and affiliates collectively referred to herein as disney  for the development and production of up to three animated feature films to be marketed and distributed by disney 
our share of revenues and expenses from toy story is governed by the terms of the feature film agreement 
in february  we entered into the co production agreement which  except for certain economic provisions applicable to toy story  superseded the feature film agreement with disney pursuant to which we  on an exclusive basis  agreed to produce five original computer animated feature length theatrical motion pictures the pictures for distribution by disney 
pixar and disney agreed to co finance the production costs of the pictures  co own the pictures with disney having exclusive distribution and exploitation rights  co brand the pictures  and share equally in the profits of each picture and any related merchandise as well as other ancillary products  after recovery of all marketing and distribution costs which disney finances  a distribution fee paid to disney and any other predefined fees or costs  including any participations provided to talent and the like 
the co production agreement generally provides that we will be responsible for the production of each picture  while disney will be responsible for the marketing  promotion  publicity  advertising and distribution of each picture 
the co production agreement also contemplates that with respect to theatrical sequels  made for home video sequels  television productions  interactive media products and other derivative works related to the pictures  we will have the opportunity to co finance and produce such products or to earn passive royalties on such products 
we will not share in any theme park revenues generated as a result of the pictures 
pursuant to the co production agreement  in addition to co financing the production costs of the pictures  disney will reimburse us for our share of certain general and administrative costs and certain research and development costs that benefit the productions 
our second feature film  a bug s life  was released in november and counted as the first original picture under the co production agreement 
in november  toy story  our third animated feature film was released 
as a theatrical sequel  toy story is a derivative work of the original toy story and therefore it does not count toward the five original pictures to be produced under the co production agreement 
as a derivative work  toy story is treated as a picture under the co production agreement  and all the provisions applicable to the five original pictures apply 
in november  we released monsters  inc  our fourth animated feature film  which counts as the second original picture under the co production agreement 
in may  we released finding nemo  our fifth animated feature film  which counts as the third original picture under the co production agreement 
we are currently in various stages of production on the remaining two films  the incredibles and cars 
these films will be produced and distributed under the co production agreement and will count as the fourth and fifth films of the pictures to be produced under the co production agreement 
the incredibles is scheduled to be released november  and cars is currently scheduled for a holiday release 
all payments to us from disney for development and production of toy story under the feature film agreement  and a bug s life  toy story  monsters  inc  finding nemo  the incredibles and cars under the co production agreement have been recorded as cost reimbursements 
accordingly  no revenue has been recognized for such reimbursements  rather  we have netted the reimbursements against the related costs 

table of contents these reimbursed costs through the end of fiscal are set forth in note of notes to financial statements 
the statements regarding the targeted release dates for our future films are forward looking  and the actual release dates may differ 
factors that could cause delays in the release of our films include  but are not limited to the uncertainties related to production delays  financing requirements  personnel availability  external socioeconomic and political events  and the release dates of competitive films 
see risk factors in item of this form k 
critical accounting policies revenue recognition we recognize film revenue from the distribution of our animated feature films and related products when earned and reasonably estimable in accordance with statement of position accounting by producers or distributors of films sop 
the following are the conditions that must be met in order to recognize revenue in accordance with sop persuasive evidence of a sale or licensing arrangement with a customer exists  the film is complete and  in accordance with the terms of the arrangement  has been delivered or is available for immediate and unconditional delivery  the license period of the arrangement has begun and the customer can begin its exploitation  exhibition or sale  the arrangement fee is fixed or determinable  and collection of the arrangement fee is reasonably assured 
under the co production agreement  we share equally with disney in the profits of finding nemo  monsters  inc  toy story and a bug s life after disney recovers its marketing  distribution and other predefined costs and fees 
our revenues for toy story are governed by the terms of the feature film agreement 
the amount of revenue recognized in any given quarter or quarters from all of our films depends on the timing  accuracy and sufficiency of the information we receive from disney to determine revenues and associated gross profits 
although disney provides us with the most current information available to enable us to recognize our share of revenue and determine our film gross profit  we may make adjustments to that information based on our estimates and judgments 
for example  our theatrical revenues may be adjusted for our estimated reserves on potential uncollectible amounts to be received from theatrical exhibitors 
we also make adjustments to our home video revenues for estimates on return reserves that may differ from those reported by disney 
the estimates on reserves may be adjusted periodically based on actual rates of returns  inventory levels in the distribution channel  as well as other business and industry information 
in addition  we utilize margin normalization  such as with merchandising or home video  in accordance with the provisions of sop this may result in the utilization of budgeted or forecasted information rather than actual costs incurred if it is deemed to be a more accurate reflection of our participation 
similar to return reserves  these expense estimates are reviewed and may be adjusted periodically to ensure the most accurate depiction of our participation is reflected 
such adjustments were made to home video reserve and home video and merchandise expense estimates during fiscal and additionally  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  our fiscal reporting period differed from that of disney 
consequently  it was necessary to use a combination of information from disney and our own estimates to determine our revenues for the period between disney s fiscal period end and ours 
disney may also make subsequent adjustments to the information that it has provided  and these adjustments could have a material impact on our operating results in later periods 
as updated information becomes available from disney on a more timely basis  it may result in a change of estimation for revenue recognition 
for example  we received updated information from disney in the first quarter of fiscal  which decreased previously recorded home video expenses by million for all of our film titles on a cumulative basis 
this resulted in an increase of to our diluted net income per share for our first quarter 
table of contents of fiscal we also received a settlement on monsters  inc merchandise revenue for the third quarter ended september   which resulted in an increase of million to our revenues and to our diluted net income per share 
during fiscal  one time adjustments to a bug s life and toy story home video reserves and margins and merchandising revenues had a positive net impact of to our diluted net income per share 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we recognized an adjustment which reduced our monsters  inc domestic home video revenue after we received updated information from disney  which reflected higher returns of domestic home video than had been originally anticipated 
this adjustment reduced our home video revenues by million and had a net impact of to our diluted net income per share in the second quarter of fiscal additionally  we have the right to audit disney s books and records related to the pictures according to the terms of the co production agreement  which could result in adjustments that may be material to the financial statements in any given quarter or quarters 
any revenue received in advance from disney is deferred and recorded as revenue when earned 
in accordance with the provisions of sop  a film is classified as a library title after three years from the film s initial release 
currently  toy story  a bug s life and toy story are classified as library titles 
the term library titles is used solely for the purpose of classification and for identifying previously released films in accordance with the provisions of sop revenue recognition for such titles is in accordance with our revenue recognition policy for film revenue 
film production costs we capitalize our share of direct film production costs in accordance with sop film production costs include costs to develop and produce computer animated motion pictures  which primarily consists of salaries  equipment and overhead 
with regard to the pictures  we capitalize film production costs in excess of reimbursable amounts from disney 
with respect to project and beyond  we capitalize all film production costs 
production overhead  a component of film costs  includes allocable costs of individuals or departments with exclusive or significant responsibility for the production of our films 
capitalized production overhead does not include administrative  general and research and development expenses 
in addition to the films produced  we are also working on concept development for several new projects 
once a film is released  capitalized film production costs will be amortized in the proportion that the revenue during the period for each film bears to the estimated revenue to be received from all sources under the individual film forecast computation method 
the amount of film costs that will be amortized each quarter will depend on how much future revenue we expect to receive from each film 
we make certain estimates and judgments of our future gross revenues to be received for each film based on information received from disney  and our knowledge of the industry 
estimates of anticipated total gross revenues are reviewed periodically and may be revised if necessary 
a change to the estimate of gross revenues for an individual film may result in an increase or decrease to the percentage of amortization of capitalized film costs relative to a previous period 
unamortized film production costs are compared with net realizable value each reporting period on a film by film basis 
if estimated remaining gross revenues are not sufficient to recover the unamortized film production costs  the unamortized film production costs will be written down to fair value 
results of operations our revenues are derived primarily from our animated feature films and related products  and to a lesser extent  software licensing 
feature film revenue and related products represented  and of our total revenue in fiscal  and  respectively 
significant film revenue streams include worldwide theatrical  home video  television and consumer products 
home video sales  including vhs and dvd formats  continue to be among the largest contributors to lifetime revenues of our films 
the television market for our feature films generally follows the theatrical and home video release 
we intend to release all of our films on television  which includes pay per view  pay television and network television 
our results for the year ended january  were driven primarily by the worldwide theatrical release  domestic home video release  merchandise and ancillary royalties from finding nemo 
by the end of fiscal  finding nemo had generated approximately million in worldwide box office receipts  comprised of 
table of contents million domestically and million internationally 
we also recognized domestic home video sales of approximately million home video units  comprised of million vhs units and million dvd units 
continuing revenues from monsters  inc and our library titles also contributed to fiscal results 
revenue total revenue  which consists of film revenue and software revenue  amounted to million in  million in and million in film revenue was million in  million in and million in film revenues for consisted of revenues from our library titles toy story  a bug s life and toy story of million and million from monsters  inc domestic theatrical release 
revenues from our library titles resulted from television licensing  home video sales and merchandise sales  and ancillary royalties  including revenues resulting from a one time transaction associated with interactive games 
film revenues for consisted of million from monsters  inc and million in revenues from our library titles 
revenues for monsters  inc were derived from worldwide home video sales  foreign box office receipts  merchandise sales and ancillary royalties 
revenues from our library titles resulted primarily from international television licensing  worldwide home video sales  merchandising sales and ancillary royalties 
included within these amounts were revenues of million as a result of one time adjustments to film revenue from a bug s life and toy story home video reserves and margins and merchandising revenues  which had a net impact of to our diluted net income per share 
the higher revenues in relative to were primarily due to the tremendous success of monsters  inc in both foreign theatrical and worldwide home video markets 
film revenues for consisted of million from finding nemo  primarily attributable to domestic home video revenues and worldwide theatrical revenues 
monsters  inc contributed million  resulting primarily from domestic television licensing and merchandising revenues 
during fiscal  we received updated information from disney  which decreased previously recorded home video expenses by million for all of our film titles on a cumulative basis 
we also received a settlement on monsters  inc merchandise revenue  which resulted in an increase of million to our revenues 
library titles contributed million for fiscal  resulting from merchandising  worldwide home video sales and foreign television licensing 
the higher revenues in relative to were primarily due to the tremendous success of finding nemo in both worldwide theatrical and domestic home video markets 
in may  two of our library titles  toy story and toy story  were placed on a domestic home video sales moratorium 
software revenue includes software license revenue  principally from renderman  and royalty revenue from licensing physical effects  inc pei technology to a third party 
software revenue was million in  million in and million in pei  a company we acquired in  licensed certain of its technology to a third party  from which we now receive associated royalty revenue on a quarterly basis 
in spite of the increase in software revenue for  our primary focus is on content creation for animated feature films and related products  and as a result  we have not increased the time and resources necessary to generate significantly higher renderman license revenues 
therefore  we continue to expect ongoing variability in revenue derived from software licenses from year to year 
software maintenance contracts are recorded as unearned revenue and recognized ratably over the life of the maintenance agreement  which ranges from to months in duration 
for fiscal  and  disney accounted for  and  respectively  of our total revenue 
cost of revenue cost of film revenue was million in  million in  and million in  and represents primarily amortization of capitalized film costs 
cost of film revenue as a percentage of film revenue for fiscal  and was  and  respectively 
our cost of film revenue as a percentage of film revenue may vary for any given period due to changes in the mix of film revenue as the gross profit varies by film  as well as for revisions to estimates on revenue to be received under the individual film forecast 
table of contents computation method 
a change to an individual film s estimate of revenue to be received may result in an increase or decrease to the amortization of the capitalized film costs relative to a previous period 
toy story revenue has no related cost  as film costs were fully amortized by december  for fiscal  the cost of revenue percentage was the result of amortization of capitalized film costs for our library titles 
for fiscal  the cost of revenue percentage was driven by monsters  inc  which had a higher amortization percentage than our library titles in the prior year 
for fiscal  the cost of revenue percentage was driven by finding nemo 
the decrease in cost of film revenue as a percentage of total film revenue from to can be attributable to a higher proportion of revenues resulting from finding nemo  which had a lower amortization percentage than monsters  inc in the prior year  since we expect to receive more revenues from finding nemo over its lifetime 
additionally  the cost amortization percentages from our library titles have declined in the current year relative to the prior year 
cost of software revenue consists of the direct cost and manufacturing overhead required to reproduce and to package our software products  as well as amortization of purchased technology 
cost of software revenue includes no amortization of internal software development expenses since no such expenses have been capitalized 
cost of software revenue as a percentage of the related revenue decreased from in to in and then decreased to less than in cost of software revenue in and was due primarily to the amortization of purchased technology associated with the acquisition of pei 
approximately million of the pei purchase price was assigned to purchased technology  which pei licensed to a third party 
amortization of this purchased technology was completed in operating expenses total operating expenses increased from million in to million in and to million in although we expected our operating expenses to increase as a result of the growth of the studio as we ramp up to meet the needs of multiple films in production  during fiscal  our operating expenses also included certain unanticipated expenses 
for example  we expensed approximately million of costs related to a one time incentive compensation to our employees in recognition of their contribution to the box office success of finding nemo  and we wrote off million in costs previously capitalized for future film projects 
in reviewing our projects in development  we determined it unlikely that these projects would be green lighted for production within the next three years  therefore  under sop  we expensed these amounts 
we anticipate operating expenses to continue to increase in future periods due to the growth experienced by the studio as we dedicate more resources to production of our two current film projects remaining under the co production agreement and to our productions not governed by the co production agreement 
under the co production agreement  disney reimburses us for half of certain general and administrative costs and certain research and development costs that benefit the productions of the pictures 
the funding received from disney is treated as operating expense reimbursements 
see note of notes to financial statements for additional discussion of disney s operating expense reimbursements 
to the extent that personnel  facilities and other expenditures are neither capitalized by us nor allocated to and paid for by disney  and precede or are not subsequently followed by an increase in revenue  our business  operating results and financial condition will be materially adversely affected 
for example  in february we approved project for production and because it is our first feature film to be produced outside of the existing relationship with disney  certain costs that were previously reimbursed by disney will now be expensed as incurred 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and support for personnel conducting research and development for the renderman product  for our proprietary marionette tm and ringmaster tm animation and production management software and for creative development for future films 
research and development expenses were million in  million in and million in the increase in research and development costs for over was primarily attributable to an increase in employee related expenses associated with additional staffing for research and development and an increase in short film project costs and creative development costs 
research and development in increased from due to the million write off of development projects and the higher employee related expenses associated with the one time incentive compensation referred to above  as 
table of contents well as additional staffing 
we expect research and development expenses to continue to increase in future periods as we increase our investments in our proprietary technology 
to date  all research and development costs not reimbursed by disney have been expensed as incurred 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and related overhead  as well as public relations  advertising  technical support and trade show costs required to support our software segment 
sales and marketing expenses were million in  million in and million in the decrease in expenses during as compared to can be attributed to greater reimbursements received from disney for marketing costs related to monsters  inc and our other pictures 
the increase in expense in as compared to is primarily due to higher employee related costs resulting from the one time incentive compensation and increased public relations and corporate marketing costs 
we believe that sales and marketing expenses will increase in future periods  particularly in the areas of public relations and corporate marketing 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries of management and administrative personnel  insurance costs and professional fees 
general and administrative expenses have increased from million in to million in to million in the increase in general and administrative expenses from to was primarily due to increases in employee related costs  professional fees and certain one time settlements paid in the fourth quarter of the increase from to was primarily due to the one time incentive compensation referred to above and an increase in professional fees 
general and administrative expenses are expected to continue to increase in future periods 
other income  net other income  net was million in  million in and million in other income consists primarily of interest income from investments 
the decrease from to is primarily due to a one time  non recurring settlement of approximately million  unrelated to our core business in  as well as a decline in interest rates when compared to the prior year 
even though cash  cash equivalents and investments increased in  declining interest rates in caused interest income to remain flat when compared to income taxes income tax expense of million  million and million reflects our effective tax rates of  and for  and  respectively 
our income tax rate was lower in due to the utilization of research and experimentation credits for federal and state tax purposes  as well as the utilization of certain other state credits and exemptions 
in and  our income tax rate approximated us federal and california state statutory rates 
our effective tax rate may fluctuate in future periods 
see note of notes to financial statements 
capitalized film production costs we had million in capitalized film production costs as of january   consisting of costs relating to toy story  a bug s life  monsters  inc  finding nemo  the incredibles and cars  all of which are being co financed by disney under the co production agreement 
capitalized film production costs also include costs related to project  our first pixar only financed film 
in the second quarter of fiscal  we wrote off million in costs previously capitalized for future film projects 
in reviewing our projects in development  we determined it unlikely that these projects would be green lighted for production within three years following their initial cost capitalization 
therefore  under sop  these amounts were expensed in the second quarter of fiscal all toy story capitalized film costs were fully amortized as of december  
table of contents liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents and investments increased from million at december  to million at january  the increase was primarily due to cash received from disney for our share of film revenue  as well as proceeds from stock option exercises  software revenue  and interest income 
this increase was partially offset by film production spending and tax payments 
in  cash provided by operating activities was attributable to net income of million resulting primarily from film revenue related to our film library and monsters  inc  net cash collections on disney receivables of million  the non cash impact of deferred income taxes and tax benefit from stock option exercises of million  and the non cash impact of depreciation and amortization expense and amortization of capitalized film production costs  totaling million 
cash provided by operating activities for was partially offset by capitalized film production costs of million  decreases in net accounts payable and accrued liabilities of million  income taxes payable of million and unearned revenue of million 
in  cash provided by operating activities was attributable to net income of million resulting primarily from film revenue related to our film library and monsters  inc  the non cash impact of the tax benefit from stock option exercises of million  the non cash impact of depreciation and amortization expense and amortization of capitalized film production costs  totaling million and an increase in unearned revenue of million 
cash used in operating activities for included increases in our receivable from disney of million  capitalized film production costs of million  decreases in accounts payable of million  income taxes payable of million and deferred income taxes of million

cash used in operating activities for included increases in our receivable from disney of million  capitalized film production costs of million  and deferred income taxes of million 
in  and  cash used in investing activities primarily consisted of the purchase of investments and the purchase of property and equipment  offset by net proceeds from sales of investments 
in  and  cash provided by financing activities primarily consisted of proceeds from exercised stock options 
as of january   our principal source of liquidity was approximately million in cash  cash equivalents and investments 
our future capital commitments primarily consist of obligations to fund production costs of films and derivative products under the co production agreement and beyond 
pursuant to the co production agreement  we will co finance the next two original animated feature films we have in production  the incredibles and cars 
in the future  we may co finance other derivative works such as theatrical sequels  direct to home video sequels  interactive products and television productions 
additionally  we have already approved for production our first film beyond the co production agreement and will finance those costs entirely 
we also have obligations to pay portions of any revenue derived from each feature film produced under the co production agreement to our entertainment law firm in consideration for services rendered 
film production costs 
in fiscal year  we expect to spend approximately million to million  net of disney s film cost reimbursements  on direct film costs and other costs to fund our ongoing film projects under the co production agreement and beyond  which will directly impact working capital 
facility related capital expenditures 
in fiscal year  we expect to spend approximately million to million related to capital expenditures for our emeryville headquarters and studio and other facility related projects 
we believe that our current available funds and forecasted cash from operations in fiscal will be sufficient to satisfy our currently anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures  including the production costs of the incredibles and cars  as well as the production and development costs associated with films not covered under the co production agreement 
there can be no assurance that current and forecasted cash from operations will be sufficient to fund operations 
to date  we have chosen to use our 
table of contents existing cash resources to fund both the construction on our emeryville facility and film production costs 
we may continue to use our cash resources for such expenditures  or may choose to finance such capital expenditures through issuance of additional equity or debt securities  by obtaining a credit facility or by some other financing mechanism 
contractual obligations 
at january   we had contractual commitments to make payments under operating leases 
payments due under these long term obligations are as follows in thousands payments due by period less than more than total year years years years operating lease obligations total off balance sheet arrangements 
as of january   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk investment portfolio 
we invest in a variety of investment grade  interest bearing securities  fixed income securities  including obligations of corporations and national governmental entities and their agencies 
this diversification of risk is consistent with our policy to ensure safety of our principal and maintain liquidity 
we only invest in securities with a maturity of months or less  with only government obligations exceeding months 
our investments are primarily fixed rate obligations and carry a certain degree of interest rate risk 
a rise in interest rates could adversely impact the fair market value of these securities 
all of our financial instruments are held for purposes other than trading and are considered available for sale according to sfas no 
the table below provides information regarding our investment portfolio at january  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average fixed interest rates presented by expected maturity date dollars in thousands less than over year year total available for sale securities weighted average interest rate impact of foreign currency rate changes 
disney and its affiliates distribute our products in foreign markets  therefore  we are not directly exposed to foreign currency rate fluctuations 
we recognize revenues from foreign territories based on an average foreign currency exchange rate used by disney for revenue reporting 
this rate may differ from the actual exchange rate at the time cash is remitted to disney and subsequently to us 
therefore  there may be some indirect foreign currency exchange rate exposure as managed by disney
