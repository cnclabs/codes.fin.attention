item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary the company was incorporated under indiana law for the purpose of becoming the holding company for the bank 
the bank has three direct wholly owned subsidiaries  ameriana insurance agency aia  ameriana financial services  inc afs and ameriana investment management  inc 
aimi 
aia operates a general insurance agency in three locations 
afs has a brokerage operation and owns a partial interest in a life insurance company and a title insurance company 
aimi manages the company s investment portfolio 
on june   the bank converted from a federal savings bank to an indiana chartered state savings bank and changed its name to ameriana bank and trust  sb 
the company also owns a minority interest in a limited partnership organized to acquire and manage real estate investments  which qualify for federal tax credits 
the company returned to profitability in with net income of  or per diluted share compared with a net loss of  or per diluted share in the company s net income for the full year included charges totaling  or  after tax or per diluted share  taken in the second and third quarters primarily to write off the troubled lease portfolio 
these charges were offset to some extent by a gain of  or  after tax or per diluted share  on the third quarter sale of two branches in ohio 
the company s net loss for reflected both the additional reserves set aside in the fourth quarter of as well as a charge of  or  after tax or per diluted share  associated with the restructuring of the company s investment portfolio in the first quarter of despite the unfavorable charges mentioned above  the company s capital ratios remain strong 
the company s risk based capital to risk weighted assets improved to at december  from at december   and continues to be classified as well capitalized by regulatory standards 
as with most banks  the company s largest source of revenue has historically been the net interest margin  which is derived from the spread earned between its interest income and interest expense 
the interest rate environment continued at a year low point in  and actually improved the company s net interest margin 
the net interest margin improved to in from in  primarily due to the cost of interest bearing liabilities  which declined greater than the yield earned on interest earning assets 
management expects the net interest margin to contract in the coming year should interest rates remain low 
the low interest rate environment in and also kept the demand for mortgage loan refinancing at a high level 
the company continued to sell new fixed rate mortgage production to minimize potential long term interest rate risk associated with such long term  low interest loans 
as a result  gain on sale of loans and servicing rights was million in and million in due to the rate structure in early and the large volume of loans refinanced during and  current estimates indicate that the gain on sale of loans during will be significantly less than or employee pension and legal expenses increased in like many other organizations  the company s defined benefit pension cost continues to rise 
unfavorable market conditions since reduced earnings in the pension fund and accordingly caused a significant increase in the contribution required by the company 
the company s pension expense was  in compared to  in and  in management expects pension expense to continue to increase in litigation that started in continues with the troubled lease portfolio 
legal and professional fees increased to  in from  in the company s profitability is also affected by outside sources beyond management s control 
these outside sources include the economy  the regulatory environment  and government monetary and fiscal policies 
management started initiatives in to improve profits in the areas the company can control  such as limiting expense growth  expanding fee income  and enhancing operational efficiency

critical accounting policies the accounting and reporting policies of the company are in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and conform to general practices within the banking industry 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in detail in the notes to the company s consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
the financial position and results of operations can be affected by these estimates and assumptions and are integral to the understanding of reported results 
critical accounting policies are those policies that management believes are the most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results  and they require management to make estimates that are difficult  subjective or complex 
allowance for credit losses 
the allowance for credit losses provides coverage for probable losses in the company s loan portfolio 
management evaluates the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses each quarter based on changes  if any  in underwriting activities  the loan portfolio composition including product mix and geographic  industry or customer specific concentrations  trends in loan performance  regulatory guidance and economic factors 
this evaluation is inherently subjective  as it requires the use of significant management estimates 
many factors can affect management s estimates of specific and expected losses  including volatility of default probabilities  rating migrations  loss severity and economic and political conditions 
the allowance is increased through provisions charged to operating earnings and reduced by net charge offs 
the company determines the amount of the allowance based on relative risk characteristics of the loan portfolio 
the allowance recorded for commercial loans is based on reviews of individual credit relationships and an analysis of the migration of commercial loans and actual loss experience 
the allowance recorded for homogeneous loans is based on an analysis of loan mix  risk characteristics of the portfolio  fraud loss and bankruptcy experiences and historical losses  adjusted for current trends  for each homogeneous category or group of loans 
the allowance for loan losses relating to impaired loans is based on the loan s observable market price  the collateral for certain collateral dependent loans  or the discounted cash flows using the loan s effective interest rate 
regardless of the extent of the company s analysis of customer performance  portfolio trends or risk management processes  certain inherent but undetected losses are probable within the loan portfolio 
this is due to several factors  including inherent delays in obtaining information regarding a customer s financial condition or changes in their unique business conditions  the judgmental nature of individual loan evaluations  collateral assessments and the interpretation of economic trends 
volatility of economic or customer specific conditions affecting the identification and estimation of losses for larger  non homogeneous credits and the sensitivity of assumptions utilized to establish allowances for homogenous groups of loans are among other factors 
the company estimates a range of inherent losses related to the existence of these exposures 
the estimates are based upon the company s evaluation of imprecision risk associated with the commercial and consumer allowance levels and the estimated impact of the current economic environment 
mortgage servicing rights 
mortgage servicing rights msrs associated with loans originated and sold  where servicing is retained  are capitalized and included in other intangible assets in the consolidated balance sheet 
the value of the capitalized servicing rights represents the present value of the future servicing fees arising from the right to service loans in the portfolio 
critical accounting policies for msrs relate to the initial valuation and subsequent impairment tests 
the methodology used to determine the valuation of msrs requires the development and use of a number of estimates  including anticipated principal amortization and prepayments of that principal balance 
events that may significantly affect the estimates used are changes in interest rates  mortgage loan prepayment speeds and the payment performance of the underlying loans 
the carrying value of the msrs is periodically reviewed for impairment based on a determination of fair value 
impairment  if any  is recognized through a valuation allowance and is recorded as amortization of intangible assets 
goodwill and other intangibles 
the company records all assets and liabilities acquired in purchase acquisitions  including goodwill and other intangibles  at fair value as required by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
goodwill is subject  at a minimum  to annual tests for impairment 
other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives using straight line and accelerated methods  and are subject to impairment if events or circumstances indicate a possible inability to realize the carrying amount 
the initial goodwill and other intangibles recorded  and subsequent impairment analysis  requires management to make subjective judgments concerning estimates of how the acquired asset will perform in the future 
events and factors that may significantly affect the estimates include  among others  customer attrition  changes in revenue growth trends  specific industry conditions and changes in competition 
sale of two cincinnati branches in on april   the company announced that it had agreed to sell its two cincinnati area branches to peoples community bancorp  inc nasdaq nm pcbi pcbi of west chester  ohio 
the two branches are located in deer park and landen  ohio 
on september   the company announced the completion of the sale of the two branches to pcbi 
in connection with the sale  the company recorded an after tax gain of approximately  or per diluted share in the third quarter the transaction included the company s real property related to the deer park branch and its leasehold on the premises for the landen branch 
additionally  the company conveyed most consumer and commercial loans at those branches as part of the transaction  as well as the branches saving deposits  but retained and will continue to service certain single family residential mortgages originated in those locations 
investments sold in the interest rate risk position of the bank for the prior period ending december   was reviewed by management 
management determined that a significant deterioration had occurred in the company s cmo portfolio  which resulted in a large increase in the company s exposure to future increases in interest rate risk 
upon further review  management determined that the increase in the exposure was significant enough to call into question the prudence of continuing to hold the securities to maturity 
in order to take the necessary action to reduce this exposure  management decided to move the entire securities portfolio from the held to maturity accounting classification to the available for sale classification as of december  in  the company determined that most of its investments no longer fit its risk profile  given the unsettled  uncertain and volatile nature of the market and the possibility that interest rates could move against the portfolio 
the decelerating speed of prepayments on these instruments during the first quarter of was remarkable  significantly extending the practical maturity of the portfolio to a level that exceeded the bank s risk parameters 
the alternatives to taking immediate action to mitigate the potential losses  including long term funding strategies  hedging strategies and partial liquidations  were felt to be inadequate in the circumstances 
the company decided to liquidate the majority of the investment portfolio 
in march  the bank disposed of million in securities at a pretax loss of million  or approximately million after tax 
the proceeds from the liquidation of the company s investments were first applied towards repayment of short term borrowings from the fhlb 
this increased the company s flexibility to retain more of its self originated loans in portfolio and to purchase loan participations in the region as they became available 
the balance of the proceeds were used to purchase short term liquid investments  including limited maturity mbs  which present less interest rate risk than the liquidated investments  and an arm mutual fund 
the company also used some proceeds to invest in intermediate term mbs to provide a balance to its portfolio between interest rate risk reduction and maintenance of higher net interest income levels 
in september  the bank determined it could improve its net interest margin by paying down the majority of fhlb advances with the sale of a similar amount of investment securities 
the company sold an additional million of investments in the third quarter and realized a gain of approximately million on the sale  which offset to some extent the loss on disposition of investments realized earlier in the year 
the proceeds from this latest investment sale were used to pay off higher rate fhlb advances  which included a prepayment penalty of approximately million 
aside from the de leveraging effect  these transactions are expected to improve the company s net interest margin through the reduction of higher rate debt with proceeds from the sale of lower earning investments 
troubled lease portfolio write off on september   the company wrote off the remaining balances of two troubled equipment lease pools originated by commercial money center  a now bankrupt company and recorded an after tax loss of  or per diluted share for the year ended december  the bank entered into these leases pools  which at the time had receivables totaling  consisting primarily of equipment leases  in june and september of each lease within each pool is supported by a surety bond issued by insurance companies which were rated at least a by moodys at the time the company entered into the lease pools 
when the issuer of the lease pools filed for bankruptcy in the outstanding balance on these pools was  the insurers of the lease pools have denied responsibility for payment of the default on the lease pools alleging fraud on the part of commercial money center 
at december   the company established reserves against the two lease pools of  which was equal to approximately of the outstanding amount in default 
at the end of the second quarter of  the company set aside an additional  in specific reserves for one of the two lease pools 
subsequently  due to continued uncertainty surrounding the prospects for eventual recovery from the sureties  the fact that one of the insurance companies had its credit rating down graded to d by am best  and that the litigation with respect to the enforcement of the surety bonds was proving more protracted and challenging than originally anticipated  in keeping with the company s policy for reserving against its assets  the company determined to charge off the remaining balances of the lease pools 
financial condition total assets decreased million or to million at december   from million at december  the decrease was primarily due to the sale of the ohio branches to peoples community bancorp  inc which reduced assets approximately million see sale of two cincinnati branches in 
cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents decreased million to million at december   from million at december  the decrease was the result of investing cash and cash equivalents in investment securities 
securities investment securities increased approximately million to million at december   from million at december  this was mainly due to a decline in the loan portfolio during which resulted from refinanced mortgage loans 
due to the rate environment in  the bank continued to sell the majority of its fixed rate originations

proceeds from loans sold in the secondary markets were million in  and million in fixed mortgage loan rates have been at historic lows during this two year period  which has increased the volume of refinances 
the fixed rate residential loans are sold to minimize the bank s exposure to interest rate risk 
due to the consumer demand for fixed rate loans  the bank s residential loan portfolio has declined 
the bank generally retains loan servicing on loans originated and sold in indiana  and sold loans and loan servicing rights for loans previously originated and sold in ohio

the main reason for the decline was the sale of the two cincinnati branches which included the transfer of million in deposits

interest rate risk the bank is subject to interest rate risk to the degree that its interest bearing liabilities  primarily deposits and borrowings from the fhlb  mature or reprice at different rates than its interest earning assets 
although having liabilities that mature or reprice more frequently on average than assets may not be beneficial in times of rising interest rates  such an asset liability structure could result in higher net income during periods of declining interest rates  unless offset by other factors 
the asset liability management committee and the board of directors review the bank s exposure to interest rate changes and market risk on a quarterly basis 
this review is accomplished by the use of a cash flow simulation model using detailed securities  loan  deposit  borrowings and market information to estimate fair values of assets and liabilities using discounted cash flows 
the difference between the bank s estimated fair value of assets and the estimated fair value of liabilities  is the fair value of equity  also referred to as net present value of equity npv 
the change in the npv is calculated at different interest rate intervals 
this tests the interest rate risk exposure from movements in interest rates to determine the change in the bank s npv 
the model also tests the impact various interest rate scenarios have on net interest income and net income over a stated period of time one year  for example 
the model uses a number of assumptions  including the relative levels of market interest rates and prepayments or extension in maturity and repayment in loans  mbs and cmo  and certain types of callable investments 
these computations do not contemplate actions management may undertake to reposition the assets and liabilities  and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
in addition  certain shortcomings are inherent in the model of computing npv 
should interest rates remain or decrease below present levels  the portion of adjustable rate loans could decrease in future periods due to loan refinancing or payoff activity 
in the event of an interest rate change  pre payment levels would likely be different from those assumed in the model and the ability of borrowers to repay their adjustable rate loans may decrease during rising interest rate environments
