item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations are based on the consolidated financial statements which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of such financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates  including those related to the allowance for loan losses 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis in making judgments about the carrying values of assets that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from the amount derived from management s estimates and assumptions under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the allowance for loan losses policy is a critical accounting policy that required the most significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the allowance for loan losses is based on management s evaluation of the level of the allowance required in relation to the estimated loss exposure in the loan portfolio 
management believes the allowance for loan losses is a significant estimate and  therefore  regularly evaluates it for adequacy by taking into consideration factors such as prior loan loss experience  the character and size of the loan portfolio  business and economic conditions and management s estimation of future losses 
the use of different estimates or assumptions could produce different provisions for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is also discussed as part of  credit risk and in note to the consolidated financial statements

this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available 
management regularly reviews its loan portfolio and charge off experience to maintain the allowance at a level management feels is adequate

net interest income is determined by the difference between yields earned on interest earning assets and rates paid on interest bearing liabilities the interest rate spread and the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the company s interest rate spread is affected by regulatory  economic and competitive factors that influence interest rates  loan demand and deposit flows 
in addition  the company s net earnings are also affected by the level of nonperforming loans and foreclosed real estate  as well as the level of its noninterest income  and its noninterest expenses  such as salaries and employee benefits  occupancy and equipment costs and income taxes

the company on a consolidated basis and the bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal and state banking agencies 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that  if undertaken  could have a direct material effect on the company s and the bank s financial statements 
under capital adequacy guidelines  the company and the bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of their assets  liabilities  and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
the capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgment by the regulators about components  risk weightings  and other factors 
prompt corrective action provisions are not applicable to ban k holding companies 
quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the company and the bank to maintain minimum amounts and percentages set forth in the following table of total and tier capital as defined in the regulations to risk weighted assets as defined and of tier capital as defined to average assets as defined 
management believes  as of december  and  that the company and the bank met all capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject 
under federal reserve board regulations  the bank is required to meet certain minimum regulatory capital requirements 
this is not a valuation allowance and has not been created by charges against earnings 
it represents a restriction on stockholders equity

the company s market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk inherent in its lending and deposit taking activities 
to that end  management actively monitors and manages its interest rate risk exposure 
the measurement of market risk associated with financial instruments is meaningful only when all related and offsetting on and off balance sheet transactions are aggregated  and the resulting net positions are identified 
disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments  which reflect changes in market prices and rates  can be found in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company s primary objective in managing interest rate risk is to minimize the adverse impact of changes in interest rates on the bank s net interest income and capital  while adjusting the company s asset liability structure to obtain the maximum yield cost spread on that structure 
the company relies primarily on its asset liability structure to control interest rate risk 
however  a sudden and substantial increase or decrease in interest rates may impact the company s earnings  to the extent that the interest rates borne by assets and liabilities do not change at the same speed  to the same extent or on the same basis 
the company does not engage in trading activities 
as part of its asset and liability management  the company has emphasized establishing and implementing internal asset liability decision processes  as well as communications and control procedures to aid in managing the company s earnings 
management believes that these processes and procedures provide the company with better capital planning  asset mix and volume controls  loan pricing guidelines  and deposit interest rate guidelines which should result in tighter controls and less exposure to interest rate risk 
the matching of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring an institution s interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within a given time period 
the gap ratio is computed as dividing rate sensitive assets by rate sensitive liabilities 
a gap ratio of represents perfect matching 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds interest rate sensitive liabilities 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest ra te sensitive liabilities exceeds interest rate sensitive assets 
during a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap would adversely affect net interest income  while a positive gap would result in an increase in net interest income 
during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would result in an increase in net interest income  while a positive gap would adversely affect net interest income 
in order to minimize the potential for adverse effects of material and prolonged increases in interest rates on the results of operations  the company s management continues to monitor asset and liability management policies to better match the maturities and repricing terms of its interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
such policies have consisted primarily of i emphasizing the origination of adjustable rate loans  ii maintaining a stable core deposit base  and iii maintaining a significant portion of liquid assets cash and short term investments 
the following table sets forth certain information relating to the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at december  that are estimated to mature or are scheduled to reprice within the period shown three months more than three months to six months more than six months to one year more than one year to five years more than five years total in thousands loans  securities interest bearing deposits total rate sensitive assets deposit accounts savings and now money market time deposits total deposit accounts borrowings total rate sensitive liabilities gap repricing differences cumulative gap cumulative gap total assets

the bank s residential mortgage loans have terms which do not exceed years and are secured by one to four family residences 
loans made for an amount in excess of of the appraised value of the financed residences are generally originated with private mortgage insurance  which essentially insures that portion of the loan which is in excess of of the appraised value of the financed residences

as of december   consumer loans were approximately million or of total loans 
consumer loan underwriting standards include an examination of the applicant s payment history on other debts and an evaluation of the applicant s ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan 
although creditworthiness of the applicant is of primary importance  the underwriting process also includes a comparison of the value of the security  if any  in relation to the proposed loan amount 
while consumer loans generally involve a higher element of credit risk than one to four family residential loans  consumer loans are typically made at higher interest rates and for shorter terms  or at adjustable rates  and are helpful in maintaining a profitable spread between the bank s loan yield and its cost of funds

total off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations the company is a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit  unused lines of credit and construction loans and standby letters of credit 
these instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheet 
the contract or notional amounts of those instruments reflect the extent of the company s involvement in particular classes of financial instruments 
the company s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit  unused lines of credit and construction loans and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments 
the company uses the same credit policies in making commitments as it does for on balance sheet instruments 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
since certain commitments expire without being drawn upon  the total committed amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
the company evaluates each customer s credit worthiness on a case by case basis 
the amount of collateral obtained  if it is deemed necessary by the company upon extension of credit  is based on management s credit evaluation of the counter party 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party
