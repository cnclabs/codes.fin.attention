item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
overview the partnership s businesses fall into three major business segments the interstate natural gas pipeline segment  which comprises of our assets  the natural gas gathering and processing segment  which comprises of our assets  and the coal slurry pipeline  which comprises of our assets 
interstate natural gas pipelines in the interstate natural gas pipeline segment  there are several major business drivers 
first  a healthy long term supply outlook for each pipeline is critical 
because the primary source of gas supply for two of our pipeline systems is in the western canadian sedimentary basin  western canadian supply trends are particularly important to this segment 
the current outlook for western canadian supply looks stable for the foreseeable future  however production has exceeded new reserve addition in recent years 
increased canadian consumption related to the extraction process for oil sands projects as well as restrictions on gas production to protect oil sand reserves could also impact supplies of natural gas for export 
the supply outlook may be significantly enhanced over time by new alaskan and mackenzie delta supplies reaching the western canadian pipeline grid potentially beginning by the end of this decade 
natural gas markets are also critical to our long term financial performance 
our pipeline systems serve natural gas markets in the upper midwestern area of the united states and access a major market hub in the chicago area 
market growth has been steady with both heating load growth and direct end user growth  such as power plants and ethanol plants for our pipelines 
we charge fees for transportation which are primarily fixed and based on the amount of capacity reserved for each shipper 
contracting with shippers to reserve the available pipeline capacity as existing contracts expire is a critical factor in our success 
the weighted average life of contracts for northern border pipeline  midwestern gas transmission and viking gas transmission are three and one third years  two and one third years and four years  respectively 
during  northern border pipeline was successful in recontracting  at maximum rates  all the capacity under contracts that expired on or before november the composition of the natural gas can affect the amount of energy that is transported through a pipeline system 
beginning in  the energy content of natural gas that northern border pipeline receives at the canadian border has declined modestly from  british thermal units btus per cubic foot cf to  btus cf 
northern border pipeline s transportation contracts in conjunction with its tariff define both the volume and equivalent btu value of the gas to be transported 
a reduction in the btu level results in a higher volume of natural gas to be transported to meet an overall equivalent btu value of the gas 
this btu decline that is being experienced is primarily the result of greater processing capacity in alberta  canada 
the change has caused northern border pipeline to reduce its capacity by almost percent to maintain a high standard of system reliability for its customers 
although btu levels could go lower  we believe the btu level will stabilize near the current level of  btus cf 
midwestern gas transmission s strategy is to maximize the benefits of its central location and its connections to multiple pipeline systems 
during the fourth quarter of  it conducted a non binding open season for transportation service through new delivery interconnects with interstate pipelines serving eastern markets 
results were encouraging and we are in final negotiations for new contracts to support the development of one to two new interconnects 
in addition  competitive pipeline projects may have a negative impact on our profitability such as the proposed anr pipeline company project to expand its access to the chicago hub and reduce its reliance on viking gas transmission s deliveries at marshfield  wisconsin for its wisconsin customers 
this project would increase the price competition between canadian supply entering anr pipeline in wisconsin versus chicago sourced natural gas in illinois and could affect viking gas transmission s future revenues for wisconsin markets served through anr pipeline 
natural gas gathering and processing the gas gathering and processing segment accepts delivery of raw gas from natural gas wells at low pressure and gathers that wellhead production to central points where it is processed as necessary and compressed to high pressure for entry into the transmission pipeline grid 
key factors that have an impact on this segment are the pace of reserve development  the decline rate of existing wells  the composition of the raw gas stream being gathered  and the value of natural gas and natural gas liquids 
we charge a fee for this service in the powder river basin 
in the williston basin  we buy the natural gas we gather and then resell the extracted natural gas liquids and residue  retaining a portion of the resale revenues in return for our gathering and processing services 
in some cases  we charge a fee as well 
the producers receive the balance of the proceeds from the resale 
the williston basin has exhibited steady to slow growth in overall volume levels 
the powder river area has seen net declines in gathering volumes throughout where production from existing wells declined and was not replaced by new wells at the same rate 
growth was limited by the slower than expected issuance of drilling permits on federal lands  reserve performance and regulatory issues 
in the powder river basin  earnings and cash flows have been below initial expectations as a result of a slower pace of drilling and higher than expected well production declines 
we recorded impairment charges of million and shortened the depreciable life to reflect the current value of these assets 
in addition  we are in the process of renegotiating our gathering contracts with the purpose of stabilizing the revenue levels by charging a fee for the use of our facilities instead of fees based upon volumes gathered 
we will also reconfigure systems where possible to reduce costs 
we hold minority interests in bighorn  fort union  and lost creek which are trunk gathering systems in the powder river and wind river basins 
these businesses are also impacted by the pace of drilling  regulatory issues and declines in upstream areas  however  they are generally more stable in terms of throughput volumes and revenues because they gather gas from larger areas 
coal slurry pipeline black mesa pipeline company is our coal slurry pipeline 
this pipeline has one major customer  the coal supplier to the mohave generating station  in laughlin  nevada 
this contract on black mesa provides a steady  fee for service  revenue stream through after that time  the future is uncertain 
the mohave plant must complete some significant pollution control investments  and a new water supply for the coal slurry mixture must be established 
in addition  new contracts for the coal supply  must be completed 
we believe that we will be able to negotiate a new contract for black mesa s services  however  we cannot predict the timing or ultimate outcome 
in the event the mohave plant permanently closes  estimated shut down costs could be in the range of million to million for such expenses as environmental reclamation  severance payments and pension plan funding 
we would also be required to take a non cash charge of approximately million related to goodwill and the remaining undepreciated cost of the assets 
for all of our operations  we have continual focus on reliability for our shippers  safety for the public and our customers  and compliance with regulatory rules and regulations 
in our businesses  these areas are essential 
strategy we are focused on growing our businesses  our income and cash flow and our distributions to unitholders 
our strategy involves three main components 
interstate natural gas pipelines first  we will continue to focus on safe  efficient  and reliable operations and the further development of our regulated pipelines 
we intend to maintain our position as a low cost transporter of canadian gas to the midwestern us and provide highly valued services to our customers 
any growth in our interstate pipelines would occur through incremental projects intended to access new markets or supply areas and would be supported by long term contracts 
we continue to work with producers and marketers to develop the contractual support for a new mile pipeline project  the bison pipeline  to connect the coal bed methane reserves in the powder river basin to markets served by northern border pipeline 
northern border pipeline intends to hold a new open season for the bison pipeline when production increases to levels that it believes will support the project 
if sufficient commitments are received  northern border pipeline will pursue regulatory approvals 
in addition  midwestern gas transmission will pursue expanding existing interconnects and serving new delivery interconnects with other interstate pipelines to grow transportation revenues 
on viking gas transmission  we will work to minimize any impact on our recontracting efforts that anr pipeline company s proposal to expand its capacity in the north leg of its pipeline system may have 
we also intend to continue to expand the marketing of new services to meet our customers needs on our interstate pipelines 
as was the case last year  each of our interstate pipelines have some firm transportation contracts expiring in similar to other industries  the value of capacity on interstate pipelines is driven by supply and demand conditions 
in particular  with respect to northern border pipeline and viking gas transmission  the relationship between gas prices in canada and prices in the midwestern us markets will determine the underlying value of transportation capacity 
the current gas balance in western canada is such that our transportation has been commercially attractive for available supply that is not consumed within western canada or committed to transportation capacity on pipelines reaching downstream markets 
with expectations of a continued favorable commodity pricing environment and successful drilling programs that will trend toward more non conventional production  supply may remain stable in the near term 
to maintain an adequate gas balance in western canada  production will need to grow moderately in the future to meet anticipated demand primarily driven by gas consumption in the extraction and processing associated with canadian oil sands development 
canada holds an estimated trillion barrels of bitumen reserves 
bitumen  after it is extracted from sand  can be upgraded to synthesized crude oil through several processes 
the extraction and processing of bitumen require significant quantities of natural gas 
we do not know how many of the announced oil sands development projects will be approved and constructed but the demand for transportation on our pipeline systems could be affected adversely by the additional competition for canadian gas supply that would result 
natural gas gathering and processing we also are developing our gas gathering and processing segment where we are building on our established business relationships with producers and marketers in the canadian and rocky mountain supply basins 
during  the pricing of gas produced from the powder river basin improved as there was some relief of capacity constraints on pipelines to market hubs 
however  the pace of drilling has been slower than expected due primarily to regulatory issues including the basin wide environmental impact statement eis  associated litigation and response  and water disposal issues and reserve performance 
we expect to see continued build out of our gathering systems within the areas of acreage dedications we have secured  particularly in the powder river basin  but more slowly than previously expected 
depending on the pace of production development  response to the basin wide eis and resultant litigation and water discharge permitting  we expect growth from new well connection to offset the decline from existing gas wells to result in level to slightly lower in aggregate gathered volumes on our powder river systems bear paw energy  bighorn and fort union during we are also pursuing different approaches to conducting business in the powder river basin to reduce capital and operating expenditures  improve revenue  and reduce volume and capital recovery risks 
we seek to build extensions to existing facilities on dedicated acreage using lower risk rate structures  expand our gathering network securing additional acreage dedications  and encourage utilization of existing facilities 
we expect modest growth in gas volumes for our pipelines in the wind river  williston and western canadian sedimentary basins  reflecting prospects for drilling activity within these production areas 
in the williston basin  we seek to build extensions and expansions around our existing facilities and also pursue opportunities to reduce costs and streamline operations 
in addition  we are pursuing new acreage dedications in each of these areas 
the build out of our existing  and the addition of new  acreage dedications should mitigate production declines and allow further improvement in cost efficiencies 
with regard to our investment in the gregg lake obed pipeline in alberta  canada  opportunities exist for a potential expansion of the pipeline and discussions are underway with prospective customers 
acquisitions finally  our objective is to continue to acquire complementary businesses 
our goal is approximately to million of capital expenditures annually in growth through acquisitions and internal development 
we target businesses that leverage our core competencies of energy transportation  are conservative in terms of commodity price risk  are located in the us and canada  and provide immediate earnings and cash flow contribution 
our strategy is to focus on acquisitions of natural gas assets including interstate and intrastate natural gas pipelines  storage facilities and gathering and processing assets 
we anticipate financing our capital expenditures and acquisitions conservatively through an appropriate mix of additional borrowings and equity issuances 
although we regularly evaluate various acquisition opportunities  we cannot provide assurance that we will reach our goal each year and would also expect that  depending on specific opportunities that develop  acquisitions in some years could significantly exceed our goal stated above 
our ability to maintain and grow our distributions to the unitholders is dependent upon the growth of our existing businesses and or our acquisitions 
critical accounting policies and estimates certain amounts included in or affecting our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures must be estimated  requiring us to make certain assumptions with respect to values or conditions that cannot be known with certainty at the time the financial statements are prepared 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
key estimates used by our management include the economic useful lives of our assets used to determine depreciation and amortization  the fair values used to determine possible asset impairment charges  the fair values used to record derivative assets and liabilities  expense accruals  and the fair values of assets acquired 
any effects on our business  financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
our significant accounting policies are summarized in note notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
certain of our accounting policies are of more significance in our financial statement preparation process than others 
the interstate natural gas pipelines accounting policies conform to statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation 
accordingly  certain assets that result from the regulated ratemaking process are recorded that would not be recorded under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america for nonregulated entities 
we continually assess whether the future recovery of the regulatory assets is probable by considering such factors as regulatory changes and the impact of competition 
if future recovery ceases to be probable  we would be required to write off the regulatory assets at that time 
at december   we have recorded regulatory assets of million  which are being recovered from the pipelines shippers over varying periods of time 
our long lived assets are stated at original cost 
we must use estimates in determining the economic useful lives of those assets 
useful lives are based on historical experience and are adjusted when changes in planned use  technological advances or other factors show that a different life would be more appropriate 
the depreciation rate used for utility property is an integral part of the interstate pipelines ferc tariffs 
any revisions to the estimated economic useful lives of our assets will change our depreciation and amortization expense prospectively 
for utility property  no retirement gain or loss is included in income except in the case of retirements or sales of entire operating units 
the original cost of utility property retired is charged to accumulated depreciation and amortization  net of salvage and cost of removal 
we review long lived assets for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of the carrying amount of assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
estimates of future net cash flows include anticipated future revenues  expected future operating costs and other estimates 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the comparative impact of no longer amortizing goodwill is shown in note  notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
we have selected the fourth quarter for the performance of our annual impairment testing 
as discussed below  in  we decided to accelerate the impairment testing for our natural gas gathering and processing business segment to the third quarter 
our remaining business segments were tested in the fourth quarter 
as discussed in note  notes to consolidated financial statements  effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred  if the liability can be reasonably estimated 
we have  where possible  developed our estimate of the retirement obligations 
the implementation of sfas no 
resulted in an increase in net property  plant and equipment of million  an increase in reserves and deferred credits of million and a reduction to net income of million for the net of tax cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle 
our accounting for financial instruments is in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which requires that every derivative instrument be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
the statement requires that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
special accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative s gains and losses to offset related results on the hedged item in the income statement 
at december   the consolidated balance sheet included assets from derivative financial instruments of million and liabilities from derivative financial instruments of million 
for our interstate natural gas pipelines  operating revenues are derived from agreements for the receipt and delivery of gas at points along the pipeline system as specified in each shipper s individual transportation contract 
revenues are recognized based upon contracted capacity and actual volumes transported under transportation service agreements 
for our gas gathering and processing businesses  operating revenue is recorded when gas is processed in or transported through company facilities 
for our coal slurry pipeline  operating revenue is derived from a pipeline transportation agreement 
under the terms of the agreement  we receive a monthly demand payment  a per ton commodity payment and a reimbursement for certain other expenses 
results of operations our operating results for reflected several significant events 
due to lower throughput volumes experienced and anticipated in our wholly owned subsidiaries in our natural gas gathering and processing business segment  we recorded impairment charges related to goodwill and tangible assets for that segment 
see note notes to consolidated financial statements  included elsewhere in this report 
effective january   we acquired all of the common stock of viking gas transmission  including a one third interest in guardian pipeline 
see note notes to consolidated financial statements  included elsewhere in this report 
in june  we sold our gladys and mazeppa processing plants located in alberta  canada 
the operating results for these plants are classified as discontinued operations 
see note notes to consolidated financial statements 
finally  as a result of enron s decision to terminate its cash balance plan  we recorded expenses for our expected charges related to the termination of that plan 
our operating results for reflected a full year of operating results for acquisitions we made in the first half of during  we made the following acquisitions bear paw energy on march  the mazeppa and gladys gas processing plants  gas gathering systems and a minority interest in the gregg lake obed pipeline on april  which are included in the operating results of border midstream services  and midwestern gas transmission on may our operating results also benefited from the adoption of sfas no 
our loss from continuing operations in was million  per unit  as compared to income from continuing operations of million in  per unit  and million in  per unit 
our loss in resulted from a million goodwill and asset impairment recorded for our natural gas gathering and processing segment 
excluding the impairment charges  income from continuing operations increased million in as compared to  which reflects income from viking gas transmission of million  lower interest expense for northern border pipeline of million million impact on continuing operations after minority interest due to a decrease in average interest rates as well as a decrease in average debt outstanding  a million special income allocation related to a cash distribution from our preferred a interest in bighorn gas gathering and a million payment received for a change in ownership of the other partner in bighorn gas gathering 
these increases to income were partially offset by charges associated with the termination of enron s cash balance plan of million million  net of tax and minority interest 
the calculation of per unit income loss was also impacted by the partnership s issuance of additional partnership interests in may and june the million increase in income from continuing operations in over resulted from the acquisitions made in  a decline in interest expense and the effect of the change in accounting for goodwill 
as a result of adopting sfas no 
 we are no longer amortizing goodwill see note notes to consolidated financial statements 
our operating results included million of goodwill amortization or per unit 
goodwill amortization for by business segment was as follows interstate natural gas pipelines million  natural gas gathering and processing million  and coal slurry million 
interest expense decreased million million impact on continuing operations after tax and minority interest between and primarily due to a decline in interest rates 
our average debt outstanding increased between and due to our acquisitions in the partnership s consolidated income statement reflects income loss from discontinued operations of million in as compared to million in and million in discontinued operations for include an after tax gain of million on the sale of the gladys and mazeppa processing plants 
in  discontinued operations included a million loss on a forward purchase of canadian dollars to fund our acquisition of border midstream service s gathering and processing assets 
the consolidated income statement also reflects a reduction to net income of million due to a net of tax cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  which resulted from adopting sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
interstate natural gas pipelines our interstate natural gas pipeline segment reported income of million in and million in in  excluding the impact of goodwill amortization  the segment reported income of million 
the increase in income from primarily resulted from our acquisition of viking gas transmission on january   and lower interest expense for northern border pipeline 
viking gas transmission s income for totaled million and northern border pipeline s interest expense decreased by million million net impact to income after minority interests 
the increase in income from resulted from our acquisition of midwestern gas transmission in april midwestern gas transmission s income  excluding the impact of goodwill amortization  increased million from to as the results included only eight months of revenues and expenses 
operating revenues for our interstate natural gas pipeline segment were million in  million in and million in the increase in operating revenues in over resulted from viking gas transmission revenues of million  an increase in midwestern gas transmission revenues of million and an increase in northern border pipeline s revenues of million 
midwestern gas transmission s revenues in reflect an increase in contracted capacity as compared to the same period in northern border pipeline s revenues for were affected by million of uncollected revenues associated with the transportation capacity formerly held by ena  which filed for chapter bankruptcy protection in december see the impact of enron s chapter filing on our business 
the increase in operating revenues in over resulted from an million increase in midwestern gas transmission s revenues and an million increase in northern border pipeline s revenues 
midwestern gas transmission s revenues in reflect an increase in contracted capacity as compared to the same period in midwestern gas transmission s revenues in reflected only eight months of operations 
for  northern border pipeline reflected additional revenues of approximately million related to project  which was a pipeline expansion and extension placed in service in october the impact of the additional revenues associated with project was partially offset by million of uncollected revenues associated with the transportation capacity formerly held by ena 
operations and maintenance expenses for our interstate natural gas pipeline segment were million in  million in  and million in the increase in expenses in over resulted from viking gas transmission s expense of million and an increase in northern border pipeline s expense and midwestern gas transmission s expense by a combined million 
this increase primarily related to the estimated charges for termination of enron s cash balance plan of million 
the increase in expenses in over resulted from an increase in northern border pipeline s expense by million and an increase in midwestern gas transmission s expense by million 
northern border pipeline s expenses in reflected a million accrual for costs related to the treatment of previously collected quantities of natural gas used in utility operations to cover electric power costs see footnote notes to consolidated financial statements  included elsewhere in this report 
in february  northern border pipeline filed to amend its ferc tariff to clarify the definition of company use gas  which is gas supplied by its shippers for its operations  by adding detailed language to the broad categories that comprise company use gas 
northern border pipeline had included in its collection of company use gas  quantities that were equivalent to the cost of electric power at its electric driven compressor stations during the period of june through january on march   the ferc issued an order rejecting northern border pipeline s proposed tariff sheet revision and requiring refunds with interest within days of the order 
northern border pipeline made refunds to its shippers of million in may partially offsetting this increase in expense was a reduction in bad debt expense by million 
northern border pipeline s expenses in included bad debt expense related to ena s bankruptcy 
midwestern gas transmission s increase for over was primarily due to results had included only eight months of activity and due to a million increase in employee benefit expenses and administrative expenses 
depreciation and amortization expenses  excluding goodwill amortization  for our interstate natural gas pipeline segment were million in  million in and million in the increase between and is primarily due to viking gas transmission 
the increase between and reflects a million increase in northern border pipeline s expense due to project and a million increase from midwestern gas transmission 
midwestern gas transmission s results had included only eight months of activity 
taxes other than income for our interstate natural gas pipeline segment were million  million in and million in the increase in from is primarily due to viking gas transmission expenses of million and a million increase in northern border pipeline s expense 
northern border pipeline s expense reflected a refund of use taxes previously paid on exempt purchases 
the increase in from is primarily due to a million increase in northern border pipeline s expense 
northern border pipeline periodically reviews and adjusts its estimates of ad valorem taxes 
reductions to previous estimates in exceeded reductions to previous estimates in by approximately million 
northern border pipeline s ad valorem taxes also increased for due to the completion of project interest expense for our interstate natural gas pipeline segment was million in  million in and million in the expense included million for viking gas transmission 
northern border pipeline s interest expense decreased in both and from prior year levels due to a decrease in average interest rates as well as a decrease in average debt outstanding 
other income  net for our interstate natural gas pipeline segment was million in and million in as compared to other expense of million in the decrease from to relates to a million expense for northern border pipeline s repayment of amounts received in for previously vacated microwave frequency bands 
the amount included bad debt expense of million related to the bankruptcy of a telecommunications company and an allowance for equity funds used during construction of million related primarily to northern border pipeline s project equity earnings from unconsolidated affiliates for our interstate natural gas pipeline segment were million in  which represents earnings from our one third interest in guardian pipeline 
minority interests in net income  which represent the minority interest in northern border pipeline  were million for  million for and million for the increases in and from prior year results were due to increased net income for northern border pipeline 
income tax expense for our interstate natural gas pipeline segment was million in and million in as compared to an income tax benefit of million in the amount included viking gas transmission income taxes of million 
the remaining income tax amounts relate to midwestern gas transmission 
natural gas gathering and processing our natural gas gathering and processing segment reported a loss from continuing operations of million in and income from continuing operations of million in excluding the impact of goodwill amortization  the segment reported income from continuing operations of million in the segment recorded impairment charges of million in see note notes to consolidated financial statements  included elsewhere in this report 
excluding the effect of the impairment charges  the segment s income from continuing operations increased million to million between and primarily due to a million increase in border midstream services s income from its gregg lake obed investment 
the increase in earnings over the prior year resulted from our acquisitions made in the results included nine months of activity for bear paw energy and border midstream services 
operating revenues for our natural gas gathering and processing segment were million in  million in and million in the increase in over is due to an increase in natural gas and natural gas liquid prices  which accounted for million of the overall increase  partially offset by lower volumes gathered in the powder river basin  which decreased revenues million 
the increase in operating revenues in over was primarily due to the acquisitions made in the revenues for the segment included only nine months of activity for bear paw energy 
revenues for included million recorded from gas gathering and administrative services under a master services agreement with ena that was terminated in product purchases for our natural gas gathering and processing segment were million in  million in and million in under certain gathering and processing agreements  bear paw energy purchases raw natural gas from producers at a price tied to a percentage of the price for which it sells extracted natural gas liquids and residue gas

we used the proceeds from the and partnership senior notes to fund our acquisitions in and we currently have outstanding interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts totaling million that expire in march under the interest rate swap agreements  we make payments to counterparties at variable rates based on the london interbank offered rate and in return receives payments based on a fixed rate 
the swaps were entered into to hedge the fluctuations in the market value of the partnership senior notes 
at december   the average effective interest rate on our interest rate swap agreements was 
at december   viking gas transmission has four series of senior notes outstanding 
transportation service agreements have been pledged as security for these senior notes 
viking gas transmission s senior notes indenture provides for certain restrictions on the payment of cash dividends on common stock 
the most restrictive of these is that the payment of cash dividends on common stock is prohibited unless debt service funds in an amount equal to all scheduled payments of principal and interest for the day period following the current month end would remain on deposit following the dividend payment 
at december   the requirement for accumulation of debt service funds prior to payment of dividends was million

the net proceeds from the sale of common units and the general partners capital contributions totaled approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively  and were primarily used to repay indebtedness outstanding 
short term liquidity needs will be met by our operating cash flows and through the partnership credit agreement and the pipeline credit agreement 
long term capital needs may be met through our ability to issue long term indebtedness as well as additional limited partner interests 
cash flows from operating activities cash flows provided by operating activities were million in  million in and million in the decrease from to is primarily due to northern border pipeline s refund to its shippers for million see note notes to consolidated financial statements  included elsewhere in this report 
operating cash flows were also decreased due to payments made to nbp services and northern plains for administrative services provided prior to and due to a reduction in prepayments in that northern border pipeline had required certain shippers make in for transportation service 
distributions received from unconsolidated affiliates increased million to million  primarily due to distributions received from bighorn gas gathering related to our preferred a interest discussed previously

the impact of enron s chapter filing on our business on december   enron filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy protection under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code 
certain wholly owned enron subsidiaries also filed for chapter bankruptcy protection on december  and thereafter 
we have not filed for bankruptcy protection 
northern plains  pan border and northwest border are our general partners 
each of northern plains and pan border are wholly owned subsidiaries of enron  and northwest border is a wholly owned subsidiary of transcanada 
northern plains and pan border were not among the enron companies filing for chapter protection 
the business of enron and its subsidiaries that have filed for bankruptcy protection are currently being administered under the direction and control of the bankruptcy court 
an unsecured creditors committee has been appointed in the chapter cases 
the creditors committee is responsible for general oversight of the bankruptcy case  and has the power  among other things  to investigate the acts  conduct  assets  liabilities  and financial condition of the debtor  the operation of the debtor s business and the desirability of the continuance of such business  participate in the formulation of a plan of reorganization  and file acceptances or rejections to such a plan 
on june   enron announced the organization of crosscountry energy corp  a newly formed holding company  to hold  among other assets  enron s ownership interest in northern plains  pan border and nbp services 
the motion filed in bankruptcy court to approve the proposed transfer of those ownership interests was approved on september  an amended order on december  made the approval applicable to crosscountry energy  llc crosscountry 
in connection with the closing  crosscountry and enron will enter into a transition services agreement pursuant to which enron will provide to crosscountry  on an interim  transitional basis  various services  including but not limited to i information technology services  ii accounting system usage rights and administrative support iii contract management and purchasing support services iv corporate secretary services  and v payroll  employee benefits and administrative services 
in turn  these services are provided to us through northern plains and nbp services 
when the transfer of interests in northern plains  pan border and nbp services to crosscountry as contemplated above takes place  the articles of incorporation of northern plains  pan border and nbp services will be amended to reflect certain shareholder protections that will be retained by enron until distribution of any common stock of crosscountry pursuant to the chapter plan 
northern plains and pan border  subject to applicable fiduciary duties and or contractual obligations  will need the affirmative vote of enron to vote its interest at the partnership policy committee to  among other things  a enter into any business other than owning and operating natural gas pipeline  coal slurry pipelines  natural gas gathering facilities  midstream gas processing facilities  gas and hydrocarbon liquids storage facilities and related businesses  and b enter into any compromise or settlement of any action  suit  litigation  arbitration proceeding or any governmental investigation or audit relating to the assets  liabilities or business of the entities or the partnership in excess of million 
on january   the bankruptcy court approved as complete the amended joint chapter plan and related disclosure statement chapter plan 
the chapter plan has been submitted to the creditors for approval 
several creditors have filed objections to the chapter plan  including pension benefit guaranty corporation pbgc 
the bankruptcy court has scheduled a hearing for april  on the approval 
under the chapter plan  it is anticipated that if crosscountry is not sold to a third party  as permitted by the chapter plan  its shares would be distributed directly or indirectly to creditors of the debtors 
enron s filing for bankruptcy protection has impacted us 
at the time of the filing of the bankruptcy petition  we had a number of contractual relationships with enron and its subsidiaries 
nbp services corporation  a wholly owned subsidiary of enron that is not in bankruptcy  and northern plains provided and continue to provide operating and administrative services for us and our subsidiaries 
northern plains and nbp services have continued to meet their operational and administrative service obligations under the existing agreements  and we believe they will continue to do so 
ena  a wholly owned subsidiary of enron that is in bankruptcy  was a party to transportation contracts which obligated ena to pay for of northern border pipeline s capacity 
through the proceeding in  ena rejected and terminated all of its contracts on northern border pipeline 
northern border pipeline filed claims against ena for damages for breach of contract and other claims 
ena was also a party to a transportation contract for capacity on midwestern gas transmission 
ena rejected and terminated this contract in november midwestern gas transmission filed claims against ena for breach of contract and other claims 
in addition  bear paw energy filed claims against ena relating to terminated swap agreements 
in accordance with sfas no 
 bear paw energy ceased to account for these swap agreements as hedge transactions 
bear paw energy had previously recorded approximately million in accumulated other comprehensive income related to these agreements  which is being recorded into earnings in the same periods of the originally forecasted hedges 
in  bear paw energy recorded approximately million in earnings related to the terminated hedges 
also  crestone energy ventures filed claims against ena for unpaid gas gathering and administrative services fees 
the claims against enron and ena referenced above are unsecured claims 
we are uncertain regarding the ultimate amount of damages for breach of contract or other claims that we will be able to establish in the bankruptcy proceeding  and we cannot predict the amounts that we will collect or the timing of collection 
we believe  however  that any such delay in collecting or failure to collect will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
on december   enron filed a motion seeking approval of the bankruptcy court to provide additional funding to  and for authority to terminate the enron corp 
cash balance plan plan and certain other defined benefit plans of enron s affiliates in standard terminations within the meaning of section of the employee retirement income security act of  as amended erisa 
such standard terminations would satisfy all of the obligations of enron and its affiliates with respect to funding liabilities under the plan 
in addition  a standard termination would eliminate the contingent claims of pbgc against enron and its affiliates with respect to funding liabilities under the plan 
on january   the bankruptcy court entered an order authorizing termination  additional funding and other actions necessary to effect the relief requested 
pursuant to the bankruptcy court order  any contributions to the plan are subject to the prior receipt of a favorable determination by the internal revenue service that the plan is tax qualified as of the date of termination 
in addition  the bankruptcy court order provides that the rights of pbgc and others to assert that their filed claims have not been released or adjudicated as a result of the bankruptcy court order and enron and all other interested parties retained the right to assert that such claims had been adjudicated or released 
enron management has informed northern plains and nbp services that it will seek funding contributions from each member of its erisa controlled group of corporations that employs  or employed  individuals who are  or were  covered under the plan 
northern plains and nbp services have advised us that each is a member of the erisa controlled group of corporations of enron that employs  or employed  individuals who are  or were  covered under the plan and that an amount of approximately million has been estimated for our share of northern plains and nbp services proportionate share of the up to million estimated termination costs authorized by the bankruptcy court order 
under the operating agreements with northern plains and the administrative services agreement with nbp services  these increased costs may be our responsibility 
we have accrued the amount of million to satisfy claims of reimbursement for these termination costs 
while the final amounts have not been determined  we believe this accrual is adequate to cover the allocation of these costs to us 
enron is the grantor of the enron gas pipeline employee benefit trust the trust  which when taken together with the enron corp 
medical plan for inactive participants the medical plan constitutes a voluntary employees beneficiary association or veba under section c of the internal revenue code 
in october  northern plains was advised that enron had notified the committee that has administrative and fiduciary oversight related to the trust and the medical plan  that enron had made the determination to begin necessary steps to partition the assets of the trust and the related liabilities of the medical plan among all of the participating employers of the trust 
the trust was established as a regulatory requirement for inclusion of certain costs for post employment medical benefits in the rates established for the affected pipelines  including us 
enron requested the enrolled actuary to prepare an analysis and recommendation for the allocation of the trust s assets and associated liabilities among all the participating employers 
on july   enron sought approval of the bankruptcy court to terminate the trust and to distribute its assets among certain identified pipeline companies  one being northern plains 
if enron s relief as requested is granted  northern plains would assume retiree benefit liabilities  estimated as of june   of million with an asset allocation of million 
an objection to the motion has been filed and no hearing date has been set 
an additional actuary has been engaged by enron to review the analysis and recommendations for allocations 
there can be no assurances that the allocation of liabilities and assets will not change from those set forth in the motion 
enron s filing for bankruptcy protection and related developments have had other impacts on our business and management 
numerous shareholder and employee class action lawsuit have been initiated against enron  its former independent accountants  legal advisors  executives  and board members 
enron has received several requests for information from different federal and state agencies  including ferc  and committees of the united states house of representatives and senate 
some of the information requested from enron may include information about us 
while the partnership has not been subject to these investigations or lawsuits  it is possible that in the documentation production by enron and others  confidential proprietary or commercially sensitive information concerning the partnership may have been produced 
it is also possible that some of this information may be made available to the public 
while northern plains  pan border and nbp services have not filed for chapter bankruptcy protection  their stock is owned by enron  which is in bankruptcy 
as noted above  enron could sell its interest in northern plains and or pan border  or take other action with respect to their investment in us 
enron could also cause northern plains and pan border to file for bankruptcy protection 
we have had no indication from enron that it intends to cause such companies to file for bankruptcy protection 
we are managed by a three member policy committee  with one member appointed by each general partner 
the vote of each member of the policy committee is weighted by the general partner percentage of the general partner appointing such member 
the general partner percentages for northern plains  pan border and northwest border are  and  respectively 
if enron were to sell the stock of northern plains and pan border  the purchaser would have the right to appoint a majority of our policy committee and control the activities of the partnership 
the partnership credit agreement provides that it would be a change of control and consequently an event of default thereunder if subsidiaries of enron  crosscountry and or transcanada pipelines limited do not control  free of any liens  greater than of the general partner percentages 
consequently  if enron sells the stock of northern plains and pan border or crosscountry to a third party  a waiver under the partnership credit agreement would need to be obtained 
in addition  the agreements evidencing the partnership s other material outstanding debt obligations provide that an uncured default under one material debt agreement will result in a default under other debt agreements 
northern plains also serves as operator of northern border pipeline 
if northern plains were to file for bankruptcy relief  it could potentially be removed as operator 
certain of northern border pipeline s credit agreements provide that it would be an event of default thereunder if northern plains were replaced as operator without the consent of the lenders thereunder 
the administrative services agreement between nbp services and us provides that it will terminate at such time as northern plains is no longer a general partner of the partnership 
consequently  since our partnership agreement provides that a general partner is automatically withdrawn as general partner upon filing of bankruptcy  if northern plains were to file for bankruptcy relief  the administrative services agreement would be terminated 
our partnership agreement requires that each general partner make additional capital contributions to us when we sell common units 
enron may determine that it is not in the best interest of its creditors and other constituencies in bankruptcy to make these capital contributions to northern plains and pan border 
enron could therefore decide not to allow us to pursue acquisitions financed with the issuance of additional common units 
even if enron were to permit the general partners to make a capital contribution to us  if the general partners were to subsequently file for bankruptcy relief  the capital contribution might be subject to challenge as voidable under applicable law 
other than the items set forth above  we are not are not aware of any claims made against us that arise out of the enron bankruptcy cases 
we continue to monitor developments at enron  to assess the impact on us of our existing agreements and relationships with enron and its subsidiaries  and to take appropriate action to protect our interests 
public utility holding company act puhca regulation besides its ownership in two of our general partners  all of the common stock of portland general electric company pge is owned by enron 
as the owner of pge s common stock  enron is a holding company for purposes of the public utility holding company act of puhca 
following enron s acquisition of pge in  enron annually filed a statement claiming an exemption from all provisions of puhca except the provision which addresses the acquisition of public utility company affiliates under section a 
due to enron s bankruptcy filing in december  enron was no longer able to provide necessary financial information needed to file the exemption statement 
as a result  in february  enron applied to the securities and exchange commission sec for an order of exemption under sections a  a and a 
on december   the sec issued an order denying the two applications filed by enron seeking exemption as a public utility holding company under sections a  a and a of puhca 
the sec order found  relative to the application under section a  that enron s subsidiary  pge  is not predominantly and substantially intrastate in character and does not carry on business substantially in a single state 
relative to the application under sections a and a  the sec found that enron was unable to establish that it is only incidentally a holding company and that it derives no material part of its income from an electric utility subsidiary 
on december   enron and other related entities filed an application under section a of puhca the a application 
this application claims  for each of the applicants  an exemption as a public utility holding company based on the temporary nature of the applicants current or proposed interest in pge under the chapter plan filed by enron and certain of its subsidiaries 
by sec order entered january   the hearing date on enron s pending application for exemption under puhca was postponed until february  and by sec order entered february   the hearing date was postponed until further notice 
on march   pursuant to an offer of settlement that had been previously made to the sec  enron  withdrew the a application and registered as a holding company under puhca 
immediately after enron registered  the sec issued two orders  one granting enron and its subsidiaries authority to undertake certain transactions without further authorization from the sec under puhca referred to as the omnibus order and the other approving enron s fifth amended bankruptcy plan referred to as the plan order 
the omnibus order authorizes  among other items  certain transactions specific to northern border partners  lp and its subsidiaries  including authority for northern border partners to declare and pay distributions out of capital 
further  the omnibus order authorizes northern border partners to invest as much as an additional billion in natural gas gathering  processing  storage and transportation assets and to issue and sell debt and equity securities as may be required to fund such investments or acquisitions 
the authorizations are effective until the earlier of the deregistration of enron under puhca or july  we believe that the authority relating to northern border partners and its affiliates in the omnibus order minimizes the likelihood that our business will be adversely impacted by enron s registration under puhca 
however  puhca imposes a number of restrictions on the operations of a registered holding company and its subsidiaries within the registered holding company system that can become materially more expensive and cumbersome than operations by companies that are not subject to  or exempt  from puhca 
as a subsidiary of a registered holding company  we are subject to regulation by the sec with respect to the acquisition of the securities of public utilities  the acquisition of assets and interests in any other business  declaration and payment of certain cash distributions  intra system borrowings or indemnifications  sales  services or construction transactions with other holding company system companies  and the issuance of debt or equity securities  among other matters 
to the extent those regulated activities are not approved under the omnibus order or otherwise exempt under various rules and the regulations promulgated under puhca  we would need to seek additional approvals from the sec 
at this time  we do not believe that there is a need to seek any additional authorizations from the sec in order to conduct our operations 
nevertheless  there can be no assurance that puhca will not have an adverse impact on our operations as a result of enron s registration as a holding company 
risk factors and information regarding forward looking statements statements in this annual report that are not historical information are forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of these forward looking statements are identified as any statement that does not relate strictly to historical or current facts 
forward looking statements are not guarantees of performance 
they involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
the future results of our operations may differ materially from those expressed in these forward looking statements 
such forward looking statements include the discussions in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the impact of enron s chapter filing on our business  the discussions in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview  and the discussions in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
although we believe that our expectations regarding future events are based on reasonable assumptions within the bounds of our knowledge of our business  we cannot assure you that our goals will be achieved or that our expectations regarding future developments will be realized 
with this in mind  you should consider the following important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements any customer s failure to perform its contractual obligations could adversely impact our cash flows and financial condition 
some of our shippers or their owners have experienced a deterioration of their financial condition 
should one or more file for bankruptcy protection  our ability to recover amounts owed or to resell the capacity would be impacted 
since northern plains  northern border pipeline s operator  and nbp services  administrator for us  are wholly owned subsidiaries of enron and depend on enron and certain of its affiliates for some services they provide to us  potential further developments in the enron chapter proceeding may cause either or both northern plains and nbp services to be unable to perform under their agreements or to incur increases in costs to continue or replace the services provided by enron and its affiliates 
higher costs may result from the termination of enron s pension plan and partition of the voluntary employee benefit trust 
also  enron announced its intention to create a new pipeline operating entity  which will include northern plains  pan border and nbp services 
see the impact of enron s chapter filing on our business above 
contracts on our interstate pipelines will expire prior to november  on northern border pipeline  those contracts represent approximately of its system capacity 
the interstate pipelines ability to recontract capacity as existing contracts terminate for maximum transportation rates will be subject to a number of factors including availability of natural gas supplies from the western canadian sedimentary basin  the demand for natural gas in our market areas and the basis differential between the receipt and delivery points on our system 
see overview above and item business interstate pipelines demand for transportation capacity 
our interstate pipelines are subject to extensive regulation by the ferc governing all aspects of our business  including our transportation rates 
under northern border pipeline s rate case settlement  neither northern border pipeline nor its existing customers can seek rate changes until november  at which time northern border pipeline is obligated to file a rate case 
we cannot predict what challenges our interstate pipelines may have to their rates in the future 
see item business interstate pipelines ferc regulation 
in a rate case proceeding setting the maximum rates that may be charged  our interstate pipeline systems are generally allowed the opportunity to collect from their customers a return on their assets or rate base as reflected in their financial records as well as recover that rate base through depreciation 
the amount they may collect from customers  as a result of a subsequent rate case  decreases as the rate base declines as a result of  depreciation and amortization 
in order to avoid a reduction in the level of cash available for distributions to its owners  each of these pipelines must maintain or increase its rate base through projects that maintain or add to existing pipeline facilities and or increase its rate of return 
conflicts of interest may arise between our general partners and their affiliates on one hand  and us on the other hand 
as a result of these conflicts  the general partners may favor their own interests and the interests of their affiliates over the interests of our limited partners 
we face competition from third parties in our natural gas transportation  gathering and processing businesses 
see item business interstate pipeline competition and business interstate pipelines future demand and competition 
our operations are subject to federal and state agencies for environmental protection and operational safety 
we may incur substantial costs and liabilities in the future as a result of stricter environmental and safety laws  regulations and enforcement policies 
see item business environmental and safety matters 
northern border pipeline s ability to operate its pipeline on certain tribal lands will depend on northern border pipeline s success in renegotiating before its right of way rights on tribal lands within the fort peck reservation 
see item properties 
northern border pipeline and the tribes  through a mediation process  reached a settlement in principle on the pipeline right of way lease and taxation issues 
see item legal proceedings 
if the settlement is not finalized or if northern border pipeline is unable to recover the costs of the proposed settlement in its future rates  it could have a material adverse impact on our results of operation 
black mesa s contract to transport coal slurry terminates in december if black mesa is unable to extend or enter into a new arrangement for transportation of coal slurry  black mesa could incur costs and expenses for employee related matters  a write off of recorded goodwill and removal of certain facilities 
see item business  coal slurry pipeline and overview above 
part of our business strategy is to expand existing assets and acquire additional assets and businesses that will allow us to increase our cash flow and distributions to unitholders 
unexpected costs or challenges may arise whenever we acquire new assets or businesses 
successful acquisitions require management and other personnel to devote significant amounts of time to new businesses or integrating the acquired assets with existing businesses 
our ability to maintain and or expand our midstream gas gathering business will depend in large part on the pace of drilling and production activity in the western canadian sedimentary  powder river  wind river and williston basins 
drilling and production activity will be impacted by a number of factors beyond our control  including demand for and prices of natural gas and refinery grade crude oil  producer response to the recently issued eis  reserve performance  the ability of producers to obtain necessary permits and capacity constraints on natural gas transmission pipelines that transport gas from the producing areas 
see item business natural gas gathering and processing segment future demand and competition 
our financial performance will depend on our ability to successfully restructure certain gathering contracts to improve revenues  reduce operating expenditures and reduce volume and capital recovery risks in the powder river basin operations 
initiatives by states to regulate the rates that we charge for our gathering and processing of natural gas and or to assess taxes on certain aspects of our gas gathering and processing and interstate pipeline businesses may adversely impact us 
the impact of changing quality of natural gas received into our gathering and processing facilities may adversely affect our revenues and operations 
in particular  the energy content of our gathered powder river basin production exhibited a decline of approximately during to approximately btu cubic foot 
most natural gas quality standards of interstate pipelines require a minimum of btu cubic foot 
if we are unable to blend customers gas  additional treatment may be necessary to avoid curtailment of certain volumes 
although our business strategy is to pursue fee based and fixed rate contracts  some of our gas processing facilities are subject to certain contracts that give us quantities of natural gas liquids as payment of our processing services 
the income and cash flow from these contracts will be impacted directly by changes in these commodity prices 
see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk below 
we may need new capital to finance future acquisitions and expansions 
if our access to capital is limited  this will impair our ability to execute our growth strategy 
enron s circumstances have caused the credit rating agencies to review the capital structure and earnings power of energy companies  including us 
as we acquire new businesses and make additional investments in existing businesses  we may need to increase borrowings and issue additional equity in order to maintain an appropriate capital structure 
this may be dilutive to our unitholders and impact the market value of our common units 
see debt and credit facilities and issuance of common units above 
our indentures contain provisions that would require us to offer to repurchase our senior notes if moodys or standard poor s rating services rate our notes below investment grade 
see debt and credit facilities and issuance of common units above 
we may be adversely impacted by the potential enactment of legislation in various states to modify existing provisions for income tax withholding on partners distributions 
under current law  we are treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes and do not pay any income tax at the entity level 
in order to qualify for this treatment  we must derive more than of our annual gross income from specified investments and activities 
while we believe that we currently do qualify and intend to meet this income requirement  if we should fail we would be treated as if we were a newly formed corporation and the income we generate from the date of such failure would be subject to corporate income tax 
because the tax would be imposed on us  the cash available for distribution to our unitholders would be substantially reduced 
in addition  the entire amount of cash received by each unitholder would generally be taxed as a corporate dividend when received 
in addition  because of widespread state budget deficits  several states are evaluating ways to subject partnerships to entity level taxation through the imposition of state income  franchise or other forms of taxation 
if any state were to impose a tax upon us as an entity  the cash available to pay distributions would be reduced 
the partnership agreement provides that  if a law is enacted or existing law is modified or interpreted in a manner that subjects us to taxation as a corporation or otherwise subjects us to entity level taxation for federal  state or local income tax purposes  then the minimum quarterly distribution and the target distribution levels will be decreased to reflect that impact on us 
additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us  or risks that we currently deem immaterial may impair our business operations 
any of the risk factors described above could significantly and adversely impair our operating results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we may be exposed to market risk through changes in commodity prices  exchange rates and interest rates as discussed below 
a control environment has been established which includes policies and procedures for risk assessment and the approval  reporting and monitoring of financial instrument activities 
we have utilized and expect to continue to utilize financial instruments in the management of interest rate risks and our natural gas and natural gas liquids marketing activities to achieve a more predictable cash flow by reducing our exposure to interest rate and price fluctuations
