item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading global provider of operations support systems oss software solutions that help communications service providers manage their networks and services 
our service provisioning  network resource management  and service activation products and services automate service providers business processes across network planning and engineering  operations and customer care 
our customers successfully use metasolv products to introduce new services more easily  reduce service delivery times  reduce operating expenses  and optimize return on capital expenditures 
all of our revenues come from the sale of software licenses  related professional services  and support of our software 
our business was founded in  and soon afterward we began to build order processing software to help service providers needing to connect local telephone service networks with long distance service networks 
by  the year of our introduction as a publicly held company  we had become a leading provider of order processing  management and fulfillment software for service providers offering voice and data communications services over both traditional communications networks and internet based networks 
during that period our customer base was largely composed of competitive local exchange companies 
the turndown of the communications market in through saw the departure of many of these customers from the marketplace  as funding for competitive local exchange carriers declined severely 
in and  we extended our product portfolio to include service activation products  through successive acquisitions of nortel network s service commerce division  and orchestream holdings  plc 
these acquisitions also provided metasolv with a significant worldwide expansion of our customer base  operations capabilities and staff of skilled  experienced employees 
today we have offices in locations around the world  serving over customers in over countries  and are internationally recognized as a global leader in oss software for next generation communications service providers 
the environment for marketing oss software solutions to communications service providers remains challenging  after the precipitous downturn in the communications industry that began in late and accelerated during metasolv s acquisitions of new products  customers  personnel  and sales territories have been key factors that resulted in significant increases in our operating costs as a percentage of revenue during periods when revenue from certain products was declining during and the difficult market environment along with these acquisitions has necessitated that we rationalize our product offerings and reduce staffing levels in order to realize expected cost synergies and to bring our cost structure to a sustainable level 
our restructuring activities during will allow us to reduce our operating expenses by approximately million annually  which we believe will allow us to return our costs as a percentage of revenue to more normal levels 
we expect the trends that will drive increasing demand for our products and services will include an increasing worldwide use of converged  multi service ip based infrastructure for both mobile and fixed environments  and an overall growing demand for voice and data services 
we have continued to invest significantly in research and development of our products  particularly in the areas of network resource management and service activation capabilities  in order to meet the requirements of our customers and be well positioned for future growth 
we believe our product portfolio  our customer base  our people  and our continued investment and focus on network resource management  service provisioning and activation position us well to provide end to end service fulfillment capabilities to both leading and emerging communications service providers around the world 

table of contents critical accounting policies we prepare financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
this requires management to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect significantly the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
for example  estimates are used in the accounting for the allowance for doubtful accounts  contingencies  restructuring costs  realizability of tax assets and other special charges 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
our software licensing and professional services agreements with customers typically have terms and conditions that are described in signed orders and a master agreement with each customer 
our sales for a given period typically involve large financial commitments from a relatively small number of customers 
accordingly  delays in the completion of sales during a quarter may negatively impact revenues in that quarter 
consistent with industry practice  we sometimes agree to bill our license fees in more than one installment over extended periods 
when installments extend beyond six months  amounts not due immediately are deferred and recorded as revenue when payments are due  assuming all revenue recognition criteria have been met 
we generally recognize license revenues when our customer has signed a license agreement  we have delivered the software product  product acceptance is not subject to express conditions  the fees are fixed or determinable and we consider collection to be probable 
we allocate the agreed fees for multiple products and services licensed or sold in a single transaction among the products and services using the residual method as required by sop  deferring the fair value of the undelivered elements and recognizing the residual amount of the fees as revenue upon delivery of the software license 
on occasion we may enter into a license agreement with a customer requiring development of additional software functions or services necessary for the software s performance of specified functions 
for those agreements  we recognize revenue for the entire arrangement on a percentage of completion basis as the development services are provided 
we generally recognize service revenues as the services are performed 
we recognize revenues from maintenance agreements ratably over the maintenance period  usually one year 
our software products are priced to meet the needs of our target market segments  which include large facility based incumbent service providers and wireless and ip service providers 
we charge a base price for core products  coupled with additional license fees for add on modules 
in addition  we typically scale our license pricing based on the extent of our customers usage as measured by the number of users of our product  the number of our customers subscribers  or the size of the network our product helps manage 
we sell additional license capacity for our products when our customers usage of our product exceeds earlier license limits 
annual maintenance and support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the license fee for the product being maintained 
for a new customer  our initial sale of licenses and associated services  including maintenance and support  generally ranges from several hundred thousand to several million dollars 
service revenues consist principally of software implementations  upgrades and configurations  and customer training  as well as software maintenance agreements that include both customer support and the right to product updates 
we use our own employees and subcontract with system integrator partners to provide consulting services to our customers 
the majority of our services are priced on an hourly basis 
we also offer fixed price consulting packages  primarily for repeatable solutions 
since we implement some of our services on a fixed fee basis  if we incur more costs than we expect in implementations  our profitability will suffer 
our process for tracking progress to completion on such arrangements is through individual detailed project plans and the regular review of labor hours incurred compared to estimated hours to complete the project 
when estimates of costs to complete the project indicate that a loss will be incurred  these losses are recognized immediately 
any estimation process  including that which is used in preparing contract accounting models  involves inherent risk 
to the extent that our estimates of revenues and expenses on these contracts change periodically in 
table of contents the normal course of business  due to the modifications of our contractual arrangements or changes in cost  such changes would be reflected in the results of operations as a change in accounting estimates in the period the revisions are determined 
we normally ship our software and perform services shortly after we receive orders 
as a result  our quarterly financial results are largely dependent on orders received during that period 
we recognize revenue only in cases where we believe collection is probable 
in situations where collection is doubtful or when we have indications that a customer is facing financial difficulty  we recognize revenue as cash payments are received 
in addition  for customers not on the cash basis of accounting  we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon the expected collectibility of accounts receivable 
we regularly review the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts through identification of specific receivables where it is expected that payment will not be received  in addition to establishing a general reserve policy that is applied to all amounts that are not specifically identified 
if there is a deterioration of a major customer s credit worthiness or actual defaults are higher than our historical experience  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due us could be adversely affected 
the allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of the ultimate recovery of accounts receivable as of the reporting date 
changes may occur in the future that may cause us to reassess the collectibility of amounts and at which time we may need to reduce or provide additional allowances in excess of that currently provided 
we assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets by projecting whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized in the foreseeable future 
accordingly  we carry a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  which are related primarily to net deductible temporary differences  tax credit carryforwards and net operating loss carryforwards 
we evaluate a variety of factors in determining the amount of the deferred income tax assets to be recognized pursuant to sfas no  accounting for income taxes  including our earnings history  the number of years our operating loss and tax credits can be carried forward  the existence of taxable temporary differences  near term earnings expectations  and the highly competitive nature of the communications industry and its potential impact on our business 
as a result of these analyses  a million valuation allowance was established during the year ended december   and the balance of our deferred tax assets was reserved as of december  we evaluate our long lived assets  including acquired intangibles  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
recoverability of any assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of any asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
pro forma financial results we report quarterly unaudited financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
we also report pro forma financial information in earnings releases and investor conference calls 
this pro forma financial information excludes certain non cash and special charges  consisting primarily of the amortization and impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets  purchased in process research and development  and restructuring costs 
we believe the disclosure of the pro forma financial information helps investors evaluate the results of our ongoing operations 
however  we urge investors to carefully review the generally accepted accounting principles financial information included as part of our quarterly reports on form q and our annual reports on form k 

table of contents acquisitions orchestream 
in  we acquired all of the outstanding shares of orchestream holdings plc  a uk headquartered company whose core product is service activator 
with this acquisition  we expanded our oss product suite with market leading software that automates fulfillment and simplifies management and configuration of complex internet protocol virtual private networks ip vpns 
this acquisition has strengthened our globalization  mobile and ip efforts by adding key customers and expanding our european presence 
the orchestream service activator product complements our oss assets previously acquired from nortel networks  and allows us to further penetrate mobile and fixed line carriers with a comprehensive capability for managing complex ip vpns 
we acquired orchestream for approximately million  or million 
our financial results include revenues and costs of orchestream effective february oss software assets from nortel networks 
in  we acquired certain oss assets from nortel networks 
with this acquisition  we extended our product portfolio by adding a leading carrier class service activation product and several point solutions that allow communications service providers to efficiently manage and deliver differentiated services for internet protocol ip  data  and wireless communications 
as a result of the acquisition  we now offer a more comprehensive suite of oss solutions for wireless  ip  data  and traditional networks and services 
the acquisition also strengthens the worldwide scope of our product sales and services through an established presence in europe 
we acquired these assets for million in cash and the assumption of certain liabilities 
our financial results include revenues and costs of the acquired business effective february lat information systems inc in  we acquired all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of montreal based lat information systems inc  a developer of geospatial software for planning  design and management of communications networks 
our acquisition of lat information systems inc allowed us to use graphical geospatial geographic technology to expand a service provider s capabilities in network planning and engineering functions and extends the metasolv solution functionality to include support for market demand forecasting  network planning and design  service fulfillment  and executive decision support 
we offered this product under the brand metasolv network and service planning  both as a separate product and integrated with the metasolv solution 
the aggregate purchase price was approximately million consisting of million in cash and  exchangeable shares of metasolv canada holdings inc  which were exchangeable for our shares on a one to one basis 
in the third quarter of  we discontinued the production of the metasolv network and service planning product 
results of operations the year remained difficult for software companies selling into the communications industry 
many customers continued to restrain capital spending  and pricing pressures were often intense 
our results include the following financial accomplishments completed the acquisition of orchestream  which further strengthened our business in europe and for ip activation worldwide 
metasolv s revenue from service provisioning products in more than doubled over the prior year and represented approximately of metasolv s total revenue 
increased our penetration at large communications service providers  such that we now report approximately of the world s top communications providers as our customers  expanded our sales to the growing wireless mobility segment  reaching of our total revenue in and improving our long term growth opportunities 
consolidated facilities in plano  toronto and london 
we also eliminated approximately staff positions during the year 
these actions reduced our ongoing cost structure by approximately million annually  and more closely matched our current expense levels with existing revenue opportunities 

table of contents we believe our actions in provide a good foundation for future revenue growth and a return to profitability 
the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of total revenues represented by certain line items in our statements of operations 
year ended december  revenues license service total revenues cost of revenues license service amortization and impairment of intangible assets total cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative purchased in process research and development restructuring and other costs goodwill impairment total operating expenses income loss from operations interest and other income  net gain loss on investments income loss before taxes income tax expense benefit net income loss compared to revenues total revenues in the year ended december  were million  representing a decrease from million in the decrease in revenues between these periods primarily resulted from a decline in software license transactions 
license fees 
license revenues in were million  compared to million in the decline in license revenues in resulted primarily from fewer sales of some mature products  partially offset by higher revenues from sales of service activation products and the addition of orchestream license revenue in additionally  our average contract prices in declined over compared to  due to smaller implementations and competitive pricing pressures 
license sales of our products are highly dependent on capital spending by communications service providers to improve their operating support systems infrastructure 
during  we experienced some 
table of contents improvement in sales of service activation products  but overall sales activity remained depressed 
we believe the strength of our product portfolio positions us well for and to initiate new deployments and extend deployments at existing customers 
services 
revenues from services decreased to million in from million in  primarily due to lower technical consulting revenues  while maintenance revenues were essentially equal in both years 
consulting and education service revenues decreased to million in  from million in the decrease in consulting and education revenues resulted from fewer implementations of some mature software products  related to lower software sales  and also competitive pricing of services 
we are marketing larger and longer services engagements to key customers to help them use our products most efficiently  and we expect these longer engagements to provide more stability in our consulting revenues 
post contract customer support  or maintenance revenues  decreased to million in  from million in the decrease in maintenance revenues was primarily due to a decline in maintenance revenues from mature products  largely offset by higher revenues for our service activation products and the addition of maintenance revenues from products acquired from orchestream 
the newly acquired products represented approximately of our total maintenance revenues in future growth of maintenance revenues is largely dependent on our retention of existing customers  and new license sales that add recurring maintenance revenues in annually renewable agreements 
concentration of revenues 
as of december   our active customer list includes more than communications service providers worldwide  including approximately of the world s largest providers 
during  our top ten customers represented of our total revenue with no single customer accounting for more than of revenues 
in any given year we generally derive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of relatively large sales 
a loss or significant decrease in the sale of products and services to any customer from whom we received a high percentage of our total revenues during a recent year is likely to have a material adverse affect on our results of operations and financial condition 
additionally  our inability to consummate one or more substantial sales in any future period could seriously harm our operating results for that period 
international revenues 
during  we recognized million in revenues from sources outside the united states compared to million in  representing and of revenue in each period  respectively 
the growth in international revenues during was due to our increased penetration into european and asian markets  accelerated by our product acquisitions 
cost of revenues license costs 
license cost of revenues consists primarily of royalties for third party software sold in conjunction with our products 
license costs were million in and million in  representing and of license revenues in each period  respectively 
the decrease in license costs in in absolute dollars is primarily due to the lower license sales upon which royalty agreements are based  and the mix of products sold in each period 
the decrease in license costs as a percent of license revenue in reflects differences in the mix of our products sold in each period 
royalties on individual license products range from zero to approximately of revenue 
we plan to continue the use of third party software where it provides an advantage for our customers 
while this plan lowers our overall product development cost  it may increase our cost of license revenues  both in absolute terms and as a percentage of revenues 

table of contents service costs 
service cost of revenues consists of expenses to provide consulting  training and maintenance services 
these costs include compensation and related expenses for employees  and fees for third party consultants who provide services for our customers under subcontractor arrangements 
service costs were million in  up from million in  representing and of service revenues in each period  respectively 
the increase in service costs in was due to higher customer specific engineering expenses  the addition of a customer care operation in the united kingdom and expenses to support third party software 
the increase in service costs as a percentage of service revenues was primarily due to a higher level of software engineering effort for specific customers 
we record engineering effort that is specific to a customer contract as a cost of revenues  whereas engineering effort towards general product releases is normally recorded as development expense 
we expect this higher level of customer specific engineering support to continue in future periods as we work to adapt our software to provide customers with competitive advantages in their unique operating environments 
amortization and impairment of intangible assets 
the value assigned to intangible assets  primarily technology rights  is amortized over the estimated useful life of the assets using the greater of straight line or the ratio that current gross revenues related to those assets bears to the total current and anticipated future gross revenues related to those assets 
the estimated useful life of these assets range from nine months to thirty six months 
in  cost of revenues included million in amortization of intangible assets acquired from nortel networks and orchestream  a decrease of from million in the decrease in amortization expense between and is due to the write off in of intangibles from a previous acquisition  partially offset by the addition of intangible assets related to the orchestream acquisition 
operating expenses research and development expenses 
research and development expenses consist primarily of costs related to our staff of software developers  contracted development costs and the associated infrastructure costs required to support product development 
during  research and development expenses decreased to million from million in  representing and of total revenues in each period  respectively 
the year to year decrease in research and development expense was primarily due to a reduction in research and development staffing and the transfer of engineering resources to specific customer support projects  which is reported in services cost of sales 
during  our research and development investments were focused on our core competencies of network resource management  network mediation  and service activation  in support of mobility  internet protocol ip and voice over ip voip domains 
additionally  we are investing to ease integration between metasolv products with other business systems  and to further automate our customers business processes to lower their overall cost of doing business 
we have increased our development investment in service activation products and lowered development expense in several products by subcontracting additional offshore development resources 
we expect to continue a relatively large future investment in product development as we further enhance our integrated  modular suite of products to address emerging communications technologies 
the modular structure of our products allows communications service providers to implement product functionality in phases  depending on their needs  to realize near term value and to maximize opportunities for longer term benefits from an integrated oss system 
our product development methodology generally establishes technological feasibility near the end of the development process  when we have a working model 
costs incurred after the development of a working model and prior to product release are insignificant 
accordingly  we have not capitalized any software development costs 

table of contents sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions  travel  trade shows and other related expenses required to sell our software 
in  sales and marketing expenses decreased to million from million in  representing and of revenues in each period  respectively 
the decrease in sales and marketing expense in  compared to  was primarily due to lower staffing 
we expect to continue to invest in sales and marketing resources in order to expand our direct and indirect sales and marketing channels  and to drive additional revenue 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist of costs for finance and accounting  legal  human resources  information systems  facilities  bad debt expense  and corporate management not directly allocated to other departments 
general and administrative expenses in decreased to million  compared to million in  representing and of revenues in each period  respectively 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to lower provisions for bad debts  staff reductions and facilities consolidations  partially offset by the addition of facilities and information systems expenses related to our newly acquired orchestream operations in europe 
the increase in expense as a percentage of revenues reflects the relatively fixed nature of our facilities and communications infrastructure 
during the fourth quarter of  we completed facilities consolidations at several locations that are expected to lower general and administrative expenses in we expect expenses in to be lower on both an absolute basis as well as a percentage of revenue 
purchased in process research and development 
in connection with our acquisition of orchestream  we recorded purchased in process research and development ipr d charges of million in these in process projects consisted primarily of upgrades to existing products 
the value of the purchased ipr d was calculated using a discounted cash flow analysis of the anticipated income stream of the related product sales 
the projected net cash flows were computed using discount rates from to for the various purchased ipr d projects 
these projects were completed by year end in  we recorded a pre tax charge of million for purchased ipr d in connection with our acquisition of certain oss assets from nortel networks 
the projects generally included enhancements and upgrades to existing technology  enhanced communication among systems  introduction of new functionality and the development of new technology primarily for integration purposes 
the value of the purchased ipr d was calculated using a discounted cash flow analysis of the anticipated income stream of the related product sales 
the projected net cash flows were computed using discount rates from to for the various purchased ipr d projects 
these projects were essentially completed by year end restructuring and other costs 
during  the company restructured its operations to align costs with expected market conditions  and to integrate and rationalize the acquired orchestream operations with those of the company 
these charges consisted of million for reduction in force of approximately positions  approximately million for the consolidation of space at our us headquarters location  in canada and in the united kingdom  and a million nonrecurring adjustment to prepaid royalties  partially offset by a reduction in accrued liabilities of approximately million related primarily to adjustments to liabilities assumed as part of the company s acquisitions 
the estimated annualized cost savings from these actions is approximately million 
the severance payments are expected to be completed by year end and the lease payments will continue through restructuring and other costs during totaled million  comprised of approximately million related to a reduction in force of approximately positions  million for facilities consolidations and lease commitments for space being vacated  and million in asset write offs and other restructuring expenses  partially offset by a million nonrecurring adjustment to accrued royalties 
the restructuring was in response to lower software license bookings and the expectation of lower near term revenues 

table of contents goodwill impairment 
we are required to periodically assess the value of goodwill under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
we are one reporting unit  as defined by the standard 
as outlined in the authoritative literature  the assessment of whether goodwill has been impaired is based on our estimate of the fair value of the reporting unit using a model that considers both a discounted future cash flow analysis and market capitalization data 
during  the market capitalization of our company fell to a level below its book value 
the decline in the market capitalization indicated that a potential impairment in the value of goodwill existed  therefore  management performed an interim valuation in july this valuation confirmed the impairment and we recorded a charge of million to eliminate the goodwill 
the market capitalization of the company remained at a level below its book value in the first quarter of  and therefore this prolonged decline in the market capitalization indicated that the capitalization of goodwill as a result of the acquisition of orchestream holdings plc was not warranted 
accordingly  the company eliminated the goodwill and recorded a charge of million at the time of the orchestream acquisition 
interest and other income  net in  interest and other income  net  primarily consisting of interest income and interest expense  was million  compared to million in the decrease in interest and other income was primarily due to the decline in cash and marketable securities balances upon which we receive interest income  and lower interest rates earned on invested balances 
income tax expense benefit we recorded income tax expense of million in and an income tax benefit of million in under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes fas  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
fas provides for the recognition of deferred tax assets if realization of such assets is more likely than not 
based upon the available evidence  which includes our recent operating performance and projections for near term future performance  during  we recorded a valuation reserve against the remaining deferred tax assets on the books 
we believe that  when taxable income is generated  the reversal of this valuation reserve will result in a tax provision that will be lower than the expected tax rate based on the statutory us federal tax rate 
compared to revenues total revenues decreased to million in from million in the decrease in revenues between these periods resulted from a decline in license sales  partially offset by an increase in service revenues 
license fees 
license revenues declined in to million  from million in the decline in license revenues resulted primarily from fewer sales to new customers and fewer follow on sales of capacity licenses and add on functionality to existing customers 
additionally  our average contract prices in declined compared to prior years  due to smaller implementations  and competitive pricing pressures 
services 
revenues from services increased to million in from million in  primarily due to consulting and maintenance service revenues attributable to the acquisition of certain oss assets from nortel networks 

table of contents consulting and education service revenues increased to million in  from million in the increase in consulting and education revenues resulted from fewer  but larger  services engagements 
the larger project size reflects the scope of engagements primarily at larger customers  while the lower number of overall projects reflects fewer new customer implementations 
post contract customer support  or maintenance revenues  increased to million in  from million in the increase in maintenance revenues was primarily due to the inclusion of customer support for the nortel networks oss assets  partially offset by a decline in metasolv solution maintenance revenues compared to the year ago period 
the decline in same product maintenance revenues resulted primarily from financial difficulties at some of our smaller customers 
the nortel oss products represented approximately of our total maintenance revenues in concentration of revenues 
as of december   our active customer list included more than communications service providers worldwide  including approximately of the world s largest providers 
during  our top ten customers represented of our total revenue with one customer accounting for of revenue and no other single customer accounting for more than of our revenue 
international revenues 
during  we recognized million in revenues from sources outside the united states compared to million in  representing and of revenue in each period  respectively 
the growth in international revenues during was due to our increased penetration into european and asian markets  accelerated by our product acquisitions 
cost of revenues license costs 
license cost of revenues consists primarily of royalties for third party software that is embedded in our products 
license costs were million in and million in  representing and of license revenue in each period  respectively 
the decrease in license costs in in absolute dollars is primarily due to the elimination of royalty expense for use of third party e commerce software and to lower license revenues in the increase in license costs as a percent of license revenues in resulted from a single sale in the fourth quarter that included software from a third party 
service costs 
service cost of revenues consists of expenses to provide consulting  training and maintenance services 
these costs include compensation and related expenses for employees  and fees for third party consultants who provide services for our customers under subcontractor arrangements 
service costs were million in  up from million in  representing and of service revenues in each period  respectively 
the increase in service costs in resulted primarily from additional customer support for our newly acquired products and customers 
the increase in service costs as a percentage of service revenues was primarily due to a higher level of software engineering effort for specific customers 
we record engineering effort that is specific to a customer contract as a cost of revenues  whereas engineering effort towards general product releases is normally recorded as development expense 
amortization and impairment of intangible assets 
in  cost of revenues included million amortization of intangible assets acquired from both nortel networks and lat information systems inc  and a million charge for impairment of our intangible assets 
this compares to a million amortization of intangible assets in the increase in amortization expense in was due to the purchase of developed oss software technology rights and contracts from nortel networks in february of in the third quarter of  we performed an impairment test on our intangible assets and as a result reduced the value of these assets and recorded a non cash charge of million 
the revaluation of intangible assets consisted of a reduction in the value of technology rights acquired in each of the acquisitions 

table of contents operating expenses research and development expenses 
research and development expenses consist primarily of costs related to our staff of software developers  contracted development costs and the associated infrastructure costs required to support product development 
during  research and development expenses increased to million from million in  representing and of total revenues in each period  respectively 
the year to year increase in research and development expense was primarily due to increased personnel costs related to the february acquisition of new products  and was partially offset by lower contracted development expenses 
research and development expenses increased as a percentage of revenues between these periods due to the increased personnel costs  coupled with the decline in revenues 
during  our research and development investments were focused on new products and enhancements to address next generation communications networks  including wireless mobility technologies and user group defined product enhancements 
specific enhancements included improved integration between our existing products and with major crm  billing  and service assurance systems  so that communications providers can more quickly realize business efficiencies using metasolv products 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions  travel  trade shows and other related expenses required to sell our software 
in  sales and marketing expenses increased to million from million in  representing and of revenue in each period  respectively 
major changes in sales and marketing expenses between these two periods include a reduction in commission expense related to lower revenues  partially offset by a staff increase related to marketing and selling support for our new products and a strengthened sales force in europe and south america 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist of costs for finance and accounting  legal  human resources  information systems  facilities  bad debt expense  and corporate management not directly allocated to other departments 
general and administrative expenses in decreased to million  compared to million in  representing and of revenues in each period  respectively 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to a reduction in bad debt expense 
staffing in general and administrative functions remained relatively unchanged between the periods 
purchased in process research and development 
in connection with our acquisition of certain oss assets from nortel networks  we recorded a pre tax charge of million for purchased in process research and development 
at the date of the acquisition  the purchased ipr d projects had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future uses 
the projects generally included enhancements and upgrades to existing technology  enhanced communication among systems  introduction of new functionality and the development of new technology primarily for integration purposes 
the value of the purchased ipr d was calculated using a discounted cash flow analysis of the anticipated income stream of the related product sales 
the projected net cash flows were computed using discount rates from to for the various purchased ipr d projects 
these projects were essentially completed by year end our financial results in included million of purchased ipr d costs related to our lat acquisition 
restructuring and other costs 
restructuring and other costs during totaled million  comprised of approximately million related to a reduction in force of approximately positions  million for facilities consolidations and lease commitments for space being vacated  and million in asset write offs and other restructuring expenses  partially offset by a million nonrecurring adjustment to accrued royalties 

table of contents in  we recorded a pre tax restructuring charge of million that consisted of million for a reduction in force of approximately people  and approximately million for lease commitments for certain field offices being closed and related fixed asset write downs 
the restructuring was in response to lower software license bookings and the expectation of lower revenues in the second half of goodwill impairment 
during  the market capitalization of our company fell to a level below its book value 
the decline in the market capitalization indicated that a potential impairment in the value of goodwill existed  therefore  management performed an interim valuation in july this valuation confirmed that an impairment of goodwill existed and we recorded a charge of million to eliminate the goodwill 
interest and other income  net in  interest and other income  net  primarily consisting of interest income and interest expense  was million  compared to million in the decrease in interest and other income was primarily due to the decline in cash and marketable securities balances upon which we receive interest income  and lower interest rates earned on invested balances 
income tax expense benefit we recorded an income tax benefit of million in and income tax expense of million in as a percentage of the loss before taxes  our income tax benefit was in compared to income tax expense of in the difference between our effective income tax benefit and the statutory rate in was due to state and local tax benefits  purchased in process research and development not deductible for tax purposes  and the establishment of a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes fas  provides for the recognition of deferred tax assets if realization of such assets is more likely than not 
the write down of the goodwill and revaluation of intangible assets generated an increase in deferred tax benefits 
based upon the available evidence  which included our recent operating performance and projections for the future near term performance  we provided a valuation allowance of approximately million against our net deferred tax assets 
liquidity and capital resources at december   our primary sources of liquidity were cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  totaling million and representing of total assets 
we invest our cash in excess of current operating requirements in short and intermediate term investment grade securities that are available for sale as needed to finance our future growth 
total cash and marketable securities decreased million during  from a balance of million at the end of this decrease was primarily attributable to the february acquisition of orchestream holdings plc million  cash used in operations million  and capital expenditures million 
cash used in operating activities during was million  compared to million used in operations during the cash used in consisted primarily of our million net loss adjusted for noncash charges related to the impairment of goodwill  amortization of intangible assets  depreciation and amortization expense  purchased in process research and development  and other noncash items  offset by a decrease of million in working capital and a million deferred tax benefit 
the improvement over is due to a reduction in working capital resulting from the decline in revenues and improved collection of accounts receivables 
net cash provided from investing activities was million in  comprised of the net sale of million in marketable securities and the use of million in restricted cash related to the february
