item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis three years ended december  management s discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes beginning on page percent three year review of results net sales cost of products sold gross margin selling  general  and administrative expenses all other expenses income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income effective tax rate overview bemis company  inc is a leading manufacturer of flexible packaging and pressure sensitive materials supplying a variety of industries 
the food industry is our largest market  representing about percent of our total company net sales 
sales of our flexible packaging products are widely diversified among food categories and can be found in nearly every aisle of the grocery store 
other markets into which we sell our flexible packaging products include medical devices  personal care  and tissue overwrap 
our emphasis on supplying packaging to the food industry provides a more stable market environment for our flexible packaging business segment  which accounts for about percent of our net sales 
the remaining percent of our net sales is from the pressure sensitive materials business segment which  while diversified in end use products  is less focused on food industry applications and more exposed to economically sensitive end markets 
market conditions weak economic conditions have negatively impacted certain markets in which we participate that are more commodity like in nature  in particular the pressure sensitive roll label market and the market for unprinted polyethylene film 
in both cases  competitive pricing and excess industry capacity have reduced profitability in those markets 
in response  we initiated restructuring efforts during to improve profitability by removing capacity and reducing fixed costs associated with our participation in each of those markets 
competition from low cost foreign sources has not had a significant impact on our business during the past three years 
our focus on the food industry and on unique  proprietary packaging structures combined with our proximity and service to customers creates barriers to entry for these competitors 
terminated agreement to sell pressure sensitive materials segment in august  we announced an agreement to sell our pressure sensitive materials business segment for million in cash to upm kymmene  a large multinational paper company headquartered in finland 
in july of  after extensive negotiations with the u 
s 
department of justice and subsequent court proceedings in an attempt to obtain regulatory approval for the transaction  a us district court granted an injunction against the transaction  citing concerns about industry competition 
the purchase and sale agreement was terminated and we renewed our commitment to the pressure sensitive materials business segment and its customer base 
restructuring and related charges during  we recorded restructuring and related charges totaling million pre tax 
this amount included charges for the flexible packaging business segment totaling million related to the closure of three facilities murphysboro  illinois  union city  california  and prattville  alabama 
these plant closures eliminated less efficient capacity and consolidated production of monolayer blown film into fewer  more efficient facilities 
these unprinted  monolayer blown film products are sold into industrial markets in which demand has decreased substantially over the past several years 
restructuring and related charges for the pressure sensitive materials business segment totaled million in  primarily reflecting the closure costs associated with the brampton  ontario  canada and north las vegas  nevada facilities  severance costs incurred at european and brazilian operations  and supply chain adjustments 
we expect to incur an additional million of charges during the first half of in connection with the closure of the north las vegas  nevada facility 
these efforts will consolidate our roll label manufacturing into fewer plants and reduce costs in a highly competitive product line 
annual savings as a result of the restructuring events detailed above are expected to be approximately million for the flexible packaging business segment  beginning in  and approximately million for the pressure sensitive materials business segment  beginning during the second half of we expect these savings to be substantially offset by unrelated increases in employee pension and other benefit costs 
acquisitions since  we have been active participants in the consolidation of the flexible packaging industry 
our acquisition strategy is growth oriented  focused on the identification of businesses that offer unique packaging technologies  access to new markets or product lines  or critical mass 
since  we have completed four such acquisitions to enhance the breadth of our product offerings and expand the market and geographic participation of our business segments 
these four acquisitions have added nearly million of net sales to our results  about half of which is from non us manufacturing plants 
we expect to continue to be an active participant in the global consolidation of our industries 
results of operations consolidated overview for the year ended december   net sales increased percent to billion from net sales of billion in acquisitions made during the latter half of accounted for percent of this net sales growth and currency translation accounted for about percent 
the remaining percent sales growth in primarily reflects the increased sales volumes in flexible packaging 
net sales in increased percent from billion in acquisitions accounted for percent of the net sales growth in strong flexible packaging sales to food markets were more than offset by weakness in markets such as industrial products  agribusiness products  and personal care 
operating profit decreased to million in  compared to million in and million in operating profit as a percent of net sales decreased to percent in compared to percent in and percent in included in operating profit for are million of restructuring and related charges and an increase in pension expense of million from competitive pricing pressures for flexible packaging products sold into industrial markets and for pressure sensitive roll label materials  in addition to increases in certain resin costs  contributed to lower margins in operating profit levels in benefited from increased production efficiencies and cost controls in both business segments 
net income for totaled million  compared to million and million in and  respectively 
diluted earnings per share were for  including a restructuring charge of per diluted share 
this result is compared to diluted earnings per share of for and for effective january   we adopted the requirements of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
this new accounting standard requires that goodwill no longer be amortized but instead be reviewed for impairment not less than annually 
if this standard had been in effect in  diluted earnings per share would have been 
flexible packaging business segment our flexible packaging business segment provides packaging to a variety of end markets  including meat  cheese  confectionery products  personal care  pet food  frozen foods  produce  lawn and garden  diapers  tissue paper  beverages  newspaper  medical devices  bakery  and snack foods 
these markets are generally less affected by economic cycles and grow through product innovation and geographical expansion 
the most significant raw materials used in our flexible packaging business segment are polymer resins  which we use to develop and manufacture single layer and multilayer film products 
most of our flexible packaging products are sold under contract in which selling prices are adjusted periodically to reflect the prevailing market price of raw material components 
generally  the impact of raw material price changes on our operating margins is minimized by the use of these contracts 
during periods of unusual price volatility  selling price changes may lag behind changes in raw material pricing 
of the polymer resins we use  polyethylene resin is the most prevalent and experiences the greatest market price volatility 
changes in the price of polyethylene resin normally have a corresponding impact on the net sales of our packaging into the bakery  tissue and industrial markets 
during  polyethylene resin prices increased percent during the first quarter in anticipation of natural gas shortages due to conflict in the middle east and other international supply concerns 
as concerns subsided in april  prices drifted back down resulting in a volatile pricing period that delayed our ability to adjust selling prices  which negatively impacted operating margins 
our flexible packaging business segment recorded net sales of billion in  a percent increase from billion in of this total increase  percent is a result of acquisitions completed during the latter half of and percent is a result of currency translation 
during  our flexible packaging business segment benefited from the impact of new products in the shrink bag product line and growth in the medical device packaging market 
these positive factors were partially offset by weaker sales in early to weather sensitive markets such as lawn and garden  packaged ice and bottled water due to unusually cold and wet spring weather 
net sales were also negatively impacted by increased competition in industrial markets for sales of unprinted polyethylene film and multiwall paper bags for agricultural and chemical products 
in the future  we will continue to use our material science expertise to introduce new products to our customers and we believe the medical device market will continue to grow over the next several years 
we expect competition in certain low margin markets to remain strong  and we have responded by reducing costs for those products with the restructuring program described below 
net sales increased percent in from billion in acquisitions accounted for an increase of percent from levels 
this increase was partially offset by lower production volumes and inefficiencies in certain manufacturing plants driven by a change in sales mix that created capacity constraints during operating profit decreased to million in from million and million in and  respectively 
operating profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to percent in compared to percent in and percent in factors that dampened operating profit in include increased employee pension and other benefit costs and unusual volatility in the price of polyethylene resin during the first half of the year 
while raw material prices are expected to fluctuate during the next year  we do not anticipate the level of volatility that we experienced in in july  we announced a restructuring effort to reduce fixed costs  take out monolayer film capacity and direct production volume to more efficient facilities 
we closed three flexible packaging manufacturing facilities in the latter half of recording restructuring and related charges of million 
these charges included costs related to accelerated depreciation of assets totaling million  which has been recorded as costs of products sold 
the remaining million of charges include million for employee severance and related costs and million of other exit costs  primarily equipment relocation  all of which have been recorded as other costs income  net 
with the flexible packaging restructuring efforts essentially completed  we expect to achieve annual savings  primarily in cash  of about million beginning in this savings is expected to be substantially offset by unrelated increases in employee pension and other benefit costs in pressure sensitive materials business segment the pressure sensitive materials business segment offers adhesive products to three markets prime and variable information labels  which include roll label stock used in a wide variety of label markets  graphic design  used to create signage and decorations  and technical components  which represent pressure sensitive components for industries such as the electronics  automotive  battery  construction and medical industries 
this business segment was adversely affected by the general weakness in the economy  and the roll label industry in particular has been plagued with excess capacity since paper is the primary raw material used in our pressure sensitive materials business segment 
for the last several years  general economic conditions have had a greater negative influence on selling prices and operating performance than raw material costs 
our pressure sensitive materials business segment reported net sales of million in  an increase of percent compared to the prior year 
net sales were million and million in and  respectively 
the increase in net sales during is primarily related to translation of results of our european pressure sensitive materials operations due to the strengthening of the euro currency during the year 
our european operations represent about percent of our total segment net sales 
improvements in unit sales volume for roll label materials were substantially offset by unit sales volume declines in graphic products 
the combination of results attributed to changes in price and mix delivered a total of one percent improvement to net sales in during  increased unit sales volume for roll label products provided modest net sales growth in this segment compared to operating profit decreased to million or percent of net sales in from million or percent of net sales in operating profit increased in from million or percent of net sales in roll label markets remained very competitive throughout  as reduced selling prices offset much of the benefits of improving production volume during the year 
during  we recorded restructuring and related charges of million and announced the closure of two pressure sensitive materials facilities in order to improve capacity utilization in early new high performance adhesive products and ongoing six sigma production and service improvements are also expected to positively impact operating profit levels in improving economic conditions would increase demand for pressure sensitive materials products and benefit operating profit through increased sales in this segment 
in october of  we announced the restructuring of our roll label capacity 
by the end of the second quarter of  we expect to have closed two facilities to reduce fixed costs and improve capacity utilization 
restructuring and related charges of million were recorded primarily as other costs income  net  in  of which million was related to severance and related charges 
the remaining million reflects the accelerated depreciation of assets and other related costs and was recorded as an element of cost of products sold 
we expect to record approximately million of additional charges during the first half of upon completion of these efforts 
estimated savings resulting from reduced fixed costs and improved capacity utilization are expected to be about million annually  beginning in the second half of increased employee benefit and pension costs are expected to offset a portion of these savings 
consolidated gross margin gross margins decreased to in from in and in lower margins in reflect the impact of unusually volatile raw material prices for flexible packaging products  coupled with pricing pressure in markets for certain commodity like products 
we have reduced our exposure to these markets through restructuring efforts and are introducing unique materials into markets where value can be added 
restructuring charges primarily related to accelerated depreciation reduced gross margins by million in we also continue to implement six sigma efforts focused on specific areas of concern to reduce waste and manufacturing costs 
consolidated selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales for remained level with at percent and increased from the level of percent 
expenses totaled million in  million in  and million in these amounts include million in for restructuring related costs and legal fees of million for and million for  primarily related to the effort to sell the pressure sensitive materials business 
we expect selling  general and administrative expenses in to be about percent of net sales 
research and development research and development expenses increased to million in  compared to million in and million in increased research and development spending in reflects increased product development activities that incorporate newly acquired film technologies  as well as new applications for flexible packaging products 
research and development efforts associated with new pressure sensitive materials products also impacted costs in rather than managing our research and development effort as a separate business unit  we make it an integral part of our daily plant operations 
this results in lower overhead expense and limits capital requirements 
our research and development engineers work directly on commercial production equipment  bringing new products to market without the use of pilot equipment 
we believe this approach significantly improves the efficiency  effectiveness  and relevance of our research and development activities and results in earlier commercialization of new products 
expenditures that are not distinctly identifiable as research and development costs are included in cost of products sold 
interest expense during  strong cash flow from operations was used to reduce commercial paper outstanding 
in addition  interest rates continued to decline to historically low levels 
with substantially all of our outstanding debt subject to variable rates and lower debt levels during  interest expense decreased to million compared to million in and million in other costs income  net we reported net other costs of million in  compared to net other income of million in and net other costs of million in in  this item included million of restructuring charges related specifically to employee severance and related charges associated with the closure of manufacturing facilities 
results of our brazilian joint venture  which is accounted for using the equity method of accounting  are also reflected in other costs and income 
the joint venture delivered million of income during  compared to nearly breakeven in and a million loss in the joint venture has benefited from improved production efficiencies and cost control efforts over the last few years 
cash balances held in foreign bank accounts increased during and provided additional interest income compared to the prior year 
income taxes our effective tax rate was percent in  percent in and percent in the difference between our overall tax rate and the us statutory tax rate of percent in each of those three years principally relates to state and local income taxes net of federal income tax benefits 
capital expenditures capital expenditures increased to million in  compared to million in and million in the acquisition of duralam  inc delivered additional capacity to the flexible packaging business segment  effectively reducing the need for capital expenditures in one of the more significant projects in and has been the construction of the new film plant for the medical device packaging market that began operations in the summer of capital expenditures for are expected to range from to million  nearly equivalent to our expected total annual depreciation and amortization charge for planned expenditures for include additional capacity for our european operations to meet strong demand for our shrink bag products and to provide a platform to introduce new proprietary film products 
capital structure  liquidity and cash flow debt to total capitalization at december   our debt to total capitalization ratio  which we define as total debt divided by total capital total debt  deferred tax liabilities  and stockholders equity  was percent  compared to percent and percent at december  and  respectively 
the decrease in from previous year s levels reflects debt payments totaling million in and increased stockholders equity 
higher debt levels in reflect the impact of two acquisitions financed primarily with commercial paper 
credit rating our capital structure and financial practices have earned bemis company long term credit ratings of a from standard and poor s and a from moody s investors service  and a credit rating of a and p for our commercial paper program from standard and poor s and moody s investors service  respectively 
our strong financial position and credit ratings are important to our ability to issue commercial paper at favorable rates of interest 
liquidity at year end  our debt outstanding included million of commercial paper and million of long term unsecured notes 
based upon our current credit rating  we enjoy ready access to the commercial paper markets 
while not anticipated  if these markets were to become illiquid or if a credit rating downgrade limited our ability to issue commercial paper  we would draw upon existing back up credit facilities 
these credit facilities are made up of a million  multiyear credit agreement expiring in  and a million  day credit agreement that was renewed on january  each is supported by a group of major us and international banks 
covenants imposed by these bank credit facilities include limits on the sale of businesses  minimum net worth calculations  and a maximum ratio of debt to total capitalization 
in addition to funds available under these credit facilities  we also have the capability of issuing up to approximately million of extendable commercial notes ecns  which are short term instruments whose maturity can be extended to days from the date of issuance 
if these credit facilities and ecns were no longer available to us  we would expect to meet our financial liquidity needs by accessing the bank market  which would increase our borrowing cost 
commercial paper outstanding at december   has been classified as long term debt in accordance with our intention and ability to refinance such obligations on a long term basis 
the related backup credit agreement expires in interest rate swaps our long term unsecured notes include million due in july and million due in august in september  we entered into interest rate swap agreements with three us banks  which increased our exposure to variable rates 
we generally prefer variable rate debt since it has been our experience that borrowing at variable rates is less expensive than borrowing at fixed rates over the long term 
these interest rate swap agreements  which expire in and  reduced the interest cost of the million of long term debt from about percent to about percent in since these variable rates are based upon six month london interbank offered rates libor at the semiannual interest payment dates of the corresponding notes  increases in short term interest rates will directly impact the amount of interest we pay 
for each one percent increase in variable interest rates  the annual interest expense on million of total debt outstanding would increase by million 
accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america require that the fair value of these swaps  which have been designated as hedges of our fixed rate unsecured notes outstanding  be recorded as an asset or liability of the company 
the fair value of these swaps was recorded as an asset of million at december   and an asset of million at december  for each period  an offsetting increase or decrease is recorded in the fair value of the related long term notes outstanding 
these fair value adjustments do not impact the actual balance of outstanding principal due on the notes  nor do they impact the income statement or related cash flows 
credit loss from counterparty nonperformance is not anticipated 
share repurchases we did not make any share repurchases during or we purchased  shares pre split for million during as of december   management is authorized by our board of directors to purchase up to million shares of additional stock for the treasury 
pension contribution a voluntary  tax deductible contribution of million was made to our us defined benefit pension plans in august which improved the funded status of our two largest defined benefit plans 
no contributions were made to the bemis company us defined benefit pension plans during or we do not expect a contribution to those plans to be required during contributions to our non us defined benefit pension plans are not significant 
cash flow cash provided by operating activities was million in  which reflects the payment of a million pension contribution and million for restructuring and related charges during this is compared to cash flow from operations of million in and million in cash flow during benefited from reduced working capital levels that provided cash of million 
we expect cash generated by operating activities during to be more than adequate to fund all of our cash requirements that are reasonably foreseeable for contractual obligations the following table provides a summary of contractual obligations including our debt payment obligations  capital lease obligations  operating lease obligations and certain other purchase obligations as of december  contractual payments due by period in millions total less than year to years to years more than years debt payments capital leases operating leases purchase obligations these amounts are included in our consolidated balance sheets 
a portion of this debt is commercial paper backed by a bank credit facility that expires on august  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about our debt and related matters 
the present value of these obligations  excluding interest  is included on our consolidated balance sheets 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about our capital lease obligations 
we enter into operating leases in the normal course of business 
substantially all lease agreements have fixed payment terms based on the passage of time 
some lease agreements provide us with the option to renew the lease or purchase the leased property 
our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these renewal options and if we entered into additional operating lease agreements 
our operating lease obligations are described in note of our consolidated financial statements 
purchase obligations represent contracts or commitments for the purchase of raw materials  utilities  capital equipment and various other goods and services 
market risks and foreign currency exposures we enter into contractual arrangements derivatives in the ordinary course of business to manage foreign currency exposure and interest rate risks 
we do not enter into derivative transactions for trading purposes 
our use of derivative instruments is subject to internal policies that provide guidelines for control  counterparty risk  and ongoing reporting 
these derivative instruments are designed to reduce the income statement volatility associated with movement in foreign exchange rates and to achieve greater exposure to variable interest rates 
interest expense calculated on our outstanding debt is substantially subject to short term interest rates 
as such  increases in short term interest rates will directly impact the amount of interest we pay 
for each one percent increase in variable interest rates  the annual interest expense on million of total debt outstanding would increase by million 
our international operations enter into forward foreign currency exchange contracts to manage foreign currency exchange rate exposures associated with certain foreign currency denominated receivables and payables  principally for transactions in non euro zone countries 
at december  and  we had outstanding forward exchange contracts with notional amounts aggregating million and million  respectively 
forward exchange contracts generally have maturities of less than nine months and relate primarily to major western european currencies 
counterparties to the forward exchange contracts are major financial institutions 
credit loss from counterparty nonperformance is not anticipated 
we have not designated these derivative instruments as hedging instruments 
the  net settlement expense fair value related to active forward foreign currency exchange contracts is recorded on the balance sheet within current liabilities and as an element of other costs income  net  which offsets the related transaction gains and losses on the related foreign denominated asset or liability 
the operating results of our international operations are recorded in local currency and translated into us dollars for consolidation purposes 
the impact of foreign currency translation on net sales was an increase of million or percent from operating profit improved by approximately million as a result of the positive effect of foreign currency translation during dividends we increased our quarterly cash dividend by percent during the first quarter of to cents per share from cents per share 
this followed increases of percent and percent in and  respectively 
in january  the board of directors approved the st consecutive annual increase in the quarterly cash dividend on common stock to cents per share  a percent increase 
long term compensation our practice of awarding long term compensation has relied primarily on restricted stock programs that are valued at the time of the award and expensed over the vesting period 
pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for stock options  we disclose the impact on net income and earnings per share of stock options outstanding  as if compensation expense were measured using a fair value method  in the footnotes accompanying our financial statements 
if we followed a fair value based method of recognizing expense for stock options  diluted earnings per share would have been reduced by two cents for the year ended  and one cent for each of the years ended and critical accounting estimates and judgments our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to retirement benefits  intangible assets  goodwill  and expected future performance of operations 
our estimates and judgments are based upon historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following are critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the calculation of annual pension costs and related assets and liabilities  and the valuation and useful lives of intangible assets and goodwill 
accounting for annual pension costs we account for our defined benefit pension plans in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis 
a substantial portion of our pension amounts relate to our defined benefit plans in the united states 
as permitted by sfas no 
 we use a calculated value of plan assets which is further described below 
sfas no 
requires that the effects of the performance of the pension plan s assets and changes in pension liability discount rates on our computation of pension income or expense be amortized over future periods 
pension expense recorded in was million  compared to pension income of million in and pension income of million in we expect pension expense to be approximately million 
one element used in determining annual pension income and expense in accordance with sfas no 
is the expected return on plan assets 
as of january   for our us defined benefit pension plans  we have assumed that the expected long term rate of return on plan assets will be percent 
this represents a decrease from the percent level assumed for and percent level assumed for to develop the expected long term rate of return on assets assumption  we considered compound historical returns and future expectations based upon our target asset allocation 
using historical long term investment periods of  and years  our pension plan assets have earned rates of return of percent  percent and percent  respectively  each in excess of our assumed rates 
in future years  we expect that returns will be lower than the historical returns discussed above due to a generally lower inflation and interest rate environment 
considering this  we selected a percent long term rate of return on assets assumption as of january  using our target asset allocation of plan assets of percent equity securities and percent fixed income securities  our outside actuaries have used their independent economic model to calculate a range of expected long term rates of return and have determined our assumptions to be reasonable 
this assumed long term rate of return on assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets  which recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets in a systematic manner over approximately three years 
this process calculates the expected return on plan assets that is included in pension income or expense 
the difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is generally deferred and recognized over subsequent periods 
the net deferral of asset gains and losses affects the calculated value of pension plan assets and  ultimately  future pension income and expense 
at the end of each year  we determine the discount rate to be used to calculate the present value of pension plan liabilities 
this discount rate is an estimate of the current interest rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year 
in estimating this rate  we look to changes in rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency 
at december   for our us defined benefit pension plans we determined this rate to be percent  a decrease of one half of one percent from the rate used at december  pension assumptions sensitivity analysis based upon current assumptions of percent for the discount rate and percent for the expected rate of return on pension plan assets  we expect pension expense before the effect of income taxes for to be approximately million 
the following charts depict the sensitivity of estimated pension expense to incremental changes in the discount rate and the expected long term rate of return on assets 
dollars in millions total increase decrease to pension expense from current assumptions discount rate percent percent percent percent percent rate of return on assets percent percent percent percent percent at december   the actuarially measured value of the accumulated benefit obligations under the plans exceeded the fair value of the pension plan assets resulting in a minimum pension liability charge to equity accumulated other comprehensive income  net of taxes of approximately million 
at december   the fair value of the pension plan assets of the largest of the defined benefit pension plans exceeded the actuarially measured value of the accumulated benefit obligations  resulting in the reversal of a portion of the charge from the previous year 
as of december   the minimum pension liability included in equity was reduced by million 
the following chart depicts the sensitivity of the minimum pension liability adjustment to equity to changes in the assumed discount rate 
dollars in millions total increase decrease in minimum pension liability net of taxes  from current assumptions discount rate percent percent percent percent percent the million contribution to the defined benefit pension plans during increased the prepaid asset on the balance sheet 
the portion of that asset related to defined benefit plans that are underfunded is effectively reversed and recorded as a debit to equity at year end in order to record the minimum liability for the plans 
it should be noted that if the discount rate was reduced to percent at december   the accumulated benefit obligation for the largest of the defined benefit pension plans would exceed the related plan assets and the related prepaid asset of about million would be offset with a minimum pension liability adjustment and result in a corresponding charge to equity as shown in the table above 
a further decrease in discount rate to percent would only result in an additional minimum liability adjustment  net of taxes  of million 
intangible assets and goodwill the purchase price of each new acquisition is allocated to tangible assets  identifiable intangible assets  liabilities assumed  and goodwill 
determining the portion of the purchase price allocated to identifiable intangible assets and goodwill requires us to make significant estimates 
the amount of the purchase price allocated to intangible assets is generally determined by estimating the future cash flows of each asset and discounting the net cash flows back to their present values 
the discount rate used is determined at the time of the acquisition in accordance with accepted valuation methods 
goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired  including intangible assets 
we review our goodwill for impairment annually and assess whether significant events or changes in the business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the goodwill may not be recoverable 
the test for impairment requires us to make estimates about fair value  most of which are based on projected future cash flows 
our estimates associated with the goodwill impairment tests are considered critical due to the amount of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet and the judgment required in determining fair value amounts  including projected future cash flows 
goodwill was million as of december  intangible assets consist primarily of purchased technology  customer relationships  patents  trademarks  and trade names and are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives  which range from one to years  when purchased 
we review these intangible assets for impairment as changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events suggest that the remaining value is not recoverable 
the test for impairment requires us to make estimates about fair value  most of which are based on projected future cash flows 
these estimates and projections require judgments as to future events  condition and amounts of future cash flows 
new accounting pronouncements effective december   the company adopted certain disclosure provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits 
this statement requires additional disclosures to be made by employers regarding pensions and other postretirement benefit plans  but does not change the measurement or recognition of those plans 
under this statement  the disclosure provisions regarding foreign plans and estimated future benefit payments are effective for fiscal years ending after june  all other provisions under this statement are effective for fiscal years ending after december  see note and note for disclosures required under this statement 
on may   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
this statement requires that three types of freestanding financial instruments be classified as liabilities  mandatorily redeemable shares  instruments that do or may require the issuer to buy back some of its shares in exchange for cash or assets  and obligations that can be settled with shares  the value of which is fixed  tied to a variable or varies inversely with the share price 
this statement is effective for all financial instruments modified or entered into after may   and otherwise effective for interim periods beginning after december  the company will adopt the statement as required during the first quarter of  with no impact on the consolidated financial statements expected 
effective february   the company adopted fasb interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
this interpretation addresses the requirements for business enterprises to consolidate related entities in which they are determined to be the primary beneficiary as a result of their variable economic interests 
the interpretation is intended to provide guidance in judging multiple economic interests in an entity and in determining the primary beneficiary 
the interpretation outlines disclosure requirements for variable interest entities in existence prior to january   and outlines consolidation requirements for variable interest entities created after january  the company has reviewed its major commercial relationships and its overall economic interests with other companies consisting of related parties  contracted manufacturing vendors  companies in which it has an equity position  and other suppliers to determine the extent of its variable economic interest in these parties 
the review has resulted in a determination that the company would not be judged to be the primary economic beneficiary in any material relationships  or that any material entities would be judged to be variable interest entities of the company 
the company believes it has appropriately reported the economic impact and its share of risks of its commercial relationships through its equity accounting 
in november  the fasb issued fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
this interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
it also clarifies for guarantees issued after january  that a guarantor is required to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligations undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
at december  and  the company does not have any significant guarantees or required disclosures under fasb interpretation no 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
this standard reviews the accounting for certain exit costs and disposal activities currently set forth in emerging issues task force issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
the principal change relates to the requirements necessary for recognition of a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity 
the new statement requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred versus the date of commitment to an exit plan 
this statement is effective for exit and disposal activities initiated after december  the new standard principally impacts the ultimate timing of when charges are recorded as opposed to the amount of the ultimate charge 
the company adopted sfas no 
for all exit activities initiated in see note for disclosures relating to these activities 
effective january   the company adopted sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
this statement establishes accounting standards for recognition and measurement of a liability for an asset retirement obligation and the associated asset retirement cost 
the adoption of sfas no
