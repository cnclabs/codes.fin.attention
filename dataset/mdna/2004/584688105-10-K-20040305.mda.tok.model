item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with selected consolidated financial data and our financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
in addition to the historical information  the discussion in this annual report contains certain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by the forward looking statements due to the factors set forth under factors that may affect future results below and elsewhere in this annual report 
overview we are a pharmaceutical company that specializes in acute hospital care with growing revenue from sales of our first product  angiomax bivalirudin 
angiomax is a direct thrombin inhibitor that was approved by the fda in december for use as an anticoagulant in combination with aspirin in patients with unstable angina undergoing coronary angioplasty 
we began selling the product in the united states in january our total net revenue was million in  million in  and million in  generated almost entirely from sales of angiomax in the united states 
since the announcement of the results of our replace clinical trial  additional hospitals have granted angiomax formulary approval and hospital demand for the product has increased  which are critical elements of our ability to increase revenues 
we expect that these trends will continue  although near term growth in our sales of angiomax depends on a variety of factors  including physician acceptance of the replace trial results 
in the fourth quarter of  based on data from a third party industry source  the number of hospitals purchasing angiomax increased by approximately as compared to the third quarter of and the number of hospitals purchasing four or more boxes of angiomax increased by approximately as compared to the third quarter of we focus on increased use of angiomax by existing hospital customers  as well as penetration to new hospitals  to evaluate our operating performance 
since our inception we have generated significant losses  although we achieved profitability for the first time for the three months ended december  most of our expenditures to date have been for research and development activities and selling  general and administrative expenses 
research and development expenses represent costs incurred for product acquisition  clinical trials  activities relating to regulatory filings and manufacturing development efforts 
we outsource our clinical trials and manufacturing development activities to independent organizations to maximize efficiency and minimize our internal overhead 
we expense our research and development costs as they are incurred 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses  general corporate activities and costs associated with promotion and marketing activities 
we expect to continue to spend significant amounts on the development of our products in the future 
in  we plan to continue to invest in clinical studies to expand the use of angiomax and to develop clevelox 
in addition  we plan to invest in the manufacturing development of cangrelor 
we also plan to continue our sales and marketing programs to educate and inform physicians  nurses  pharmacists and other medical decision makers about the benefits of angiomax 
in light of these activities  as well as our plan to continue to evaluate possible acquisitions of development stage or approved products that would fit within our growth strategy  we will likely need to generate greater revenues to maintain profitability 
we have not generated any us taxable income to date 
any taxes paid or accrued have been state taxes based on net worth and some income taxes in international jurisdictions 
at december   net operating losses available to offset future taxable income for federal income tax purposes were approximately million 
if not utilized  federal net operating loss carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in and ending in we have not recognized the potential tax benefit of our net operating losses in our balance sheets or statements of operations 
the future utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards may be limited based upon changes in ownership pursuant to regulations promulgated under the internal revenue code of  as amended 
application of critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and other financial information 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
in addition  our reported financial condition and results of operations could vary due to a change in the application of a particular accounting standard 
we regard an accounting estimate or assumption underlying our financial statements as a critical accounting estimate where the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the level of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change  and the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
not all of these significant accounting policies  however  fit the definition of critical accounting estimates 
we have discussed our accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors  and we believe that our estimates relating to revenue recognition and inventory described below fit the definition 
revenue recognition product sales 
we sell our products primarily to wholesalers and distributors  who  in turn  sell to hospitals 
we do not recognize revenue from product sales until there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed and determinable  the buyer is obligated to pay us  the obligation to pay is not contingent on resale of the product  the buyer has economic substance apart from us  we have no obligation to bring about the sale of the product  the amount of returns can be reasonably estimated and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we record allowances for product returns  rebates and discounts at the time of sale  and report revenue net of such allowances 
we must make significant judgments and estimates in determining these allowances 
in particular  determining the allowances is difficult because we must estimate whether trends in past buying patterns will predict future product sales 
we have adjusted the allowances in the past based on our actual sales experience  and we will likely be required to make adjustments to these allowances in the future 
in determining the allowances  our considerations include the following our customers have the right to return any unopened product during the month period beginning six months prior to the labeled expiration date and ending months after the labeled expiration date 
as a result  in calculating the allowance for product returns  we must estimate the likelihood that product sold to wholesalers might remain in their inventory to within six months of expiration and determine if it will be returned 
we base our estimates on information from wholesalers  historic patterns of returns  industry data and on the expiration dates of product currently being shipped 
certain hospitals purchasing our products from wholesalers have the right to receive a discounted price and a volume based rebate if they have a direct contract with us or participate in a group purchasing organization that has a contract with us 
as a result  we must estimate the likelihood that product sold to wholesalers might be ultimately sold to a participating hospital 
we base our estimates on information from wholesalers and hospitals  industry data  historic patterns of discounts and customer rebate thresholds 
collaborations 
revenue from collaborative agreements with partners may include milestone payments 
we record these payments as deferred revenue until contractual performance obligations have been satisfied  and we then recognize these payments ratably over the term of these agreements 
when the period of deferral cannot be specifically identified from the contract  we must estimate the period based upon other critical factors contained within the contract 
we review these estimates at least annually  which could result in a change in the deferral period 
inventories we record inventory upon the transfer of title from our vendors 
inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market value  with cost determined using a weighted average of acquisition costs 
prior to fda approval of angiomax and of its original manufacturing process in december  we expensed all costs associated with the manufacture of angiomax bulk drug product and finished product to which title had transferred to us as research and development 
we recorded as inventory any angiomax bulk drug product manufactured according to its original manufacturing process to which we took title after fda approval 
along with our contract manufacturing partner  ucb bioproducts sa  we have developed a second generation chemical synthesis process  the chemilog process  for the manufacture of angiomax bulk drug substance 
the chemilog process involves enhancements to early manufacturing steps to improve the efficiency of synthesizing bivalirudin  the active ingredient of angiomax 
on may   we received fda approval for this process 
accordingly  all angiomax bulk drug product manufactured using the chemilog process to which title had transferred to us prior to may  has been expensed as research and development  and all bulk drug product manufactured after fda approval of the chemilog process has been and will be recorded as inventory 
we review our inventory for slow moving or obsolete amounts based on expected revenues 
if actual revenues are less than expected  we may be required to make allowances for excess amounts of inventory in the future 
results of operations years ended december  and net revenue 
net revenue increased to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  virtually all the revenue in both periods was from us sales of angiomax 
we believe that growth in was due primarily to increased use of angiomax by existing hospital customers and adoption of angiomax by new hospital customers as well as increased prices 
in each of and  we recognized million of a million non refundable distributor fee received from nycomed danmark a s  a european pharmaceutical company  pursuant to a collaboration agreement we entered into in this payment was recorded as deferred revenue in and is being recognized ratably over the term of our agreement with nycomed  which we estimated to be twelve years at that time 
cost of revenue 
cost of revenue in was million  or of net revenue  compared to million  or of net revenue in cost of revenue in consisted of expenses in connection with the manufacture of the angiomax sold  which represented of the cost of revenue  royalty expenses under our agreement with biogen which represented of the cost of revenue and the logistics costs of selling angiomax  such as distribution  storage  and handling  which represented of the cost of revenue 
cost of revenue in consisted of expenses in connection with the manufacture of the angiomax sold  which represented of the cost of revenue  royalty expenses under our agreement with biogen which represented of the cost of revenue and the logistics costs of selling angiomax  such as distribution  storage  and handling  which represented of the cost of revenue 
prior to obtaining fda approval for angiomax and its original manufacturing process  all costs of manufacturing angiomax were expensed as research and development costs and therefore not reflected in cost of revenue 
in late  after obtaining fda approval for angiomax and its original manufacturing process  we began recording the costs of manufacturing angiomax as inventory  which is reflected in cost of revenue when sold  rather than as research and development expense 
during and in early  we took delivery of drug material manufactured using the chemilog process 
because this material was manufactured prior to fda approval of the chemilog process  we expensed all costs of manufacturing as research and development 
this process was approved by the fda on may   and we are recording all costs of manufacturing angiomax incurred after may  as inventory 
although we sold some angiomax in that had been manufactured using the chemilog process  most of the angiomax that we sold in was manufactured using the original manufacturing process following the date of fda approval of angiomax 
we recorded the cost of manufacturing such material as cost of revenue during in  we sold a greater proportion of angiomax whose costs had been previously expensed than angiomax for which the cost of manufacturing needed to be recorded in as a result  our cost of manufacturing as a percentage of cost of revenue was higher in compared to late in the third quarter of  we began selling angiomax produced by the chemilog process whose cost of manufacturing was previously expensed 
as a result  our cost of manufacturing as a percentage of product revenue decreased substantially in the fourth quarter of we expect that we will begin selling angiomax produced using the chemilog process after fda approval as soon as the second quarter of at such time  we will experience an increase in our cost of manufacturing as a percentage of net revenue 
research and development expenses 
the funding for angiomax has represented and will continue to represent a significant portion of our research and development spending 
over of our research and development expenses in and of our research and development expenses in related to angiomax 
for and  research and development expenses relating to angiomax included the costs of clinical trials  manufacturing development costs for the bulk drug product and infrastructure  including the cost associated with preparation of us and worldwide marketing applications 
for  research and development expenses relating to clevelox  which represented of our total research and development expenses  consisted of a million license fee to astrazeneca and manufacturing development and other start up costs relating to the phase clinical trial we commenced in the fourth quarter of in patients undergoing cardiac surgery 
research and development expenses in relating to clevelox represented less than one percent of our total research and development expenses for for  research and development expenses relating to cangrelor consisted of an initial payment to astrazeneca in connection with our license 
we had no research and development expenses in relating to cangrelor 
research and development expenses decreased to million for  from million for the decrease in research and development expenses was primarily due to million less of clinical trial costs in relating to replace  which completed enrollment in  and million in lower manufacturing development costs incurred in connection with our receipt of angiomax manufactured using the chemilog process 
these lower costs were partly offset by the addition of clinical development costs of million for acuity  million in additional costs for clinical trial programs studying angiomax use in cardiac surgery and million in additional costs relating to clevelox development 
the following table identifies for each of our clinical trial programs  the indication  development phase and clinical trial spending for the years ended december  and spending for past periods is not indicative of spending in future periods 
major research and development projects year ended december  program in thousands angiomax clinical trials   manufacturing development   infrastructure   clevelox  other   we currently plan to spend approximately million to million on research and development in  of which approximately is planned for angiomax 
however  our success in expanding the approved indications for angiomax  or developing our product candidates  is highly uncertain 
we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature  timing and estimated costs of the efforts necessary to complete the development of  or the period in which material net cash inflows are expected to commence from  any of our product candidates due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing drugs  including the uncertainty of the scope  rate of progress and cost of our clinical trials and other research and development activities  the financial contributions of our third party distributors to the costs of our clinical trials  future clinical trial results  the terms and timing of any collaborative  licensing and other arrangements that we may establish  the cost and timing of regulatory approvals  the cost and timing of establishing sales  marketing and distribution capabilities  the cost of establishing clinical and commercial supplies of our product candidates  the effect of competing technological and market developments  and the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights 
we partially funded development activities relating to the chemilog process  including validation and process batch costs of approximately million and million incurred in and  respectively 
we expensed all of these development costs as research and development in the period incurred 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million for  from million for the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses of million was primarily due to an increase in salary and recruiting expenses relating to our sales force  which grew in early from to persons  and additional marketing and medical education expenses relating to the promotion of angiomax  and certain non cash stock compensation recorded in connection with options granted to non employees 
non cash stock compensation 
we amortize the deferred stock compensation that was recorded in over the respective vesting periods of the individual stock options 
we recorded amortization expense for such deferred compensation of approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we expect to record additional amortization expense for the deferred compensation associated with these options of approximately million in the amortization expense is included in our operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 
in may we granted options to a non employee consultant to purchase  shares of common stock 
in september  we amended the terms of fully vested options to purchase  shares of common stock that were granted to a non employee consultant in may in connection with these actions  we recorded million in related non cash stock compensation expense during the unvested options granted in may will be revalued  utilizing the black scholes option pricing model  and expensed over the remaining five months of their one year vesting term 
in  we accelerated the vesting of stock options held by terminated employees in connection with their termination agreements  which resulted in million in non cash compensation expense 
non cash compensation expense is included in our operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 
other income and expense 
interest income increased over to million for  from million for the increase in interest income of million was primarily due to higher cash and available for sale securities balances attributable to our public offerings in and  offset in part by lower available interest rates on securities 
for  interest income was attributable to the investment of the remaining proceeds of our sales of shares of common stock in a private placement in may and in a public offering in we had no interest expense in as there were no borrowings during this period 
we had interest expense of  during associated with the draw down of our revolving line of credit at the end of march we terminated the revolving line of credit in august years ended december  and net revenue 
net revenue increased to million in as compared to million for virtually all the revenue was from us sales of angiomax  which we commercially launched during the first quarter of the growth in was due primarily to increased use of angiomax by existing hospital customers and penetration to new hospitals 
since we announced the results of replace in november  additional hospitals have granted angiomax formulary approval and hospital demand for the product has increased 
in  we received million from nycomed as a non refundable distributor fee 
this payment has been recorded as deferred revenue and is being recognized ratably over the term of our agreement with nycomed  which we estimated to be twelve years at that time 
cost of revenue 
cost of revenue in was million  or of net revenue  compared to million  or of net revenue in cost of revenue in consisted of expenses in connection with the manufacture of the angiomax sold  which represented of the cost of revenue  royalty expenses under our agreement with biogen which represented of the cost of revenue and the logistics costs of selling angiomax  such as distribution  storage  and handling  which represented of the cost of revenue 
prior to obtaining fda approval for angiomax and its original manufacturing process  all costs of manufacturing angiomax were expensed as research and development costs 
in late  after obtaining fda approval for angiomax and its original manufacturing process  we began recording the costs of manufacturing angiomax as inventory  which is reflected in cost of revenue when sold  rather than as research and development expense 
as a result  our cost of manufacturing as a percentage of net revenue increased substantially in as we sold a higher percentage of product manufactured after the date of fda approval of angiomax 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased to million for  from million for over of the expenses related to angiomax development activities  of which were associated with replace the increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to higher clinical development costs of million relating to our replace trial and million in higher manufacturing development cost incurred in connection with our receipt of angiomax manufactured using the chemilog process 
these higher costs were partly offset by the absence of clinical development costs of the hero trial program  our phase trial of angiomax in ami that we completed in and other development programs savings 
major research and development projects year ended december  program in thousands angiomax clinical trials   manufacturing development   infrastructure   clevelox other   we partially funded development activities relating to the chemilog process  including validation and process batch costs of million and million incurred in and  respectively 
we expensed all of these development costs as research and development in the period incurred 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million for  from million for the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses of  was primarily due to additional sales expense related to the promotion of angiomax  offset in part by lower marketing expenses 
non cash stock compensation 
we amortize the deferred stock compensation that was recorded in over the respective vesting periods of the individual stock options 
we recorded amortization expense for deferred compensation of approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in  we accelerated the vesting of stock options held by terminated employees in connection with their termination agreements  which resulted in  in non cash compensation expense 
the amortization and non cash compensation expense is included in our operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 
other income and expense 
interest income decreased to  for  from million for the decrease in interest income of million was primarily due to lower cash and available for sale securities balances and lower available interest rates on securities 
for  interest income was attributable to the investment of the remaining proceeds of our sales of shares of common stock in a private placement in may and in a public offering in in  interest income was primarily attributable to the investment of the remaining proceeds of our initial public offering in august and september we had interest expense of  during associated with the draw down of our revolving line of credit at the end of march we terminated the revolving line of credit in august we had no interest expense for in  we liquidated our million principal investment in southern california edison bonds  recognizing a loss of  on the sale 
liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity 
since our inception  we have financed our operations through the sale of common and preferred stock  sales of convertible promissory notes and warrants  interest income and revenues from sales of angiomax 
we experienced our first quarterly profit during the three months ended december  in august and september  we received million in net proceeds from the sale of common stock in our initial public offering 
since our initial public offering  we have received an additional million in net proceeds in may from the sale of million shares of our common stock in a private placement  million in net proceeds in june from the sale of million shares of our common stock in a public offering and million in net proceeds in march from the sale of million shares of our common stock in a public offering 
prior to our initial public offering  we had received net proceeds of million from the private placement of equity securities  primarily redeemable convertible preferred stock  and million from the issuance of convertible notes and warrants 
in  employees purchased stock pursuant to option exercises and our employee stock purchase plan for aggregate net proceeds to us of approximately million 
in march  we entered into a collaboration agreement with nycomed  under which nycomed will serve as the exclusive distributor of angiomax in approximately countries  including countries in the european union 
under the agreement  nycomed paid us an initial non refundable fee of million and agreed to pay up to million in additional milestones based on regulatory approvals in europe 
in addition  nycomed purchased  shares of our common stock for a total purchase price of approximately million 
cash flows 
as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents  as compared to million as of december  our major uses of cash during include net cash used for operating activities of million and net cash used in investing activities of million  which were more than offset by million received from financing activities 
we used net cash of million in operating activities during this use of cash consisted of a net loss of million  an increase in accounts receivable of million related to higher sales volume and accrued interest receivable of million related to higher investment balance  a decrease in accounts payable of million  a decrease in prepaid expenses of million  and amortization of deferred revenue of million  partly offset by a increase in accrued expenses of million  non cash stock compensation of million  a decrease in inventory of million  and depreciation of million and amortization of premium on available for sale securities of million 
the increase in accrued expenses can be largely attributed to million additional patient related accruals for our clinical trials currently underway  million additional employee compensation accruals and increased royalty accruals and million additional sales related accruals associated with higher sales volumes 
during  we used million in cash in net investing activities  which consisted principally of the purchase of million of available for sale securities and purchase of million of fixed assets  mostly related to our leasehold improvements  offset by million in proceeds from the maturation and sale of available for sale securities 
cash provided by financing activities of million during consisted primarily of the proceeds of the public offering of million shares of our common stock in march that resulted in net proceeds of million 
in addition  employees purchased stock pursuant to option exercises and our employee stock purchase plan for aggregate net proceeds to us of approximately million 
funding requirements 
we expect to devote substantial resources to our research and development efforts and to our sales  marketing and manufacturing programs associated with the commercialization of our products 
our funding requirements will depend on numerous factors including the extent to which angiomax is commercially successful  the progress  level and timing of our research and development activities related to our clinical trials with respect to angiomax  clevelox and cangrelor  the cost and outcomes of regulatory reviews  the continuation or termination of third party manufacturing or sales and marketing arrangements  the cost and effectiveness of our sales and marketing programs  the status of competitive products  our ability to defend and enforce our intellectual property rights  and the establishment of additional strategic or licensing arrangements with other companies or acquisitions 
we believe  based on our operating plan as of the date of this annual report  which includes anticipated revenues from angiomax and interest income  that our current cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities would be sufficient to fund our operations into and beyond  without requiring us to obtain external financing 
we expect  however  to periodically assess our financing alternatives and access the capital markets opportunistically 
if our existing resources are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements due to slower than anticipated revenues from angiomax or otherwise  or if we acquire additional product candidates  we may need to sell additional equity or debt securities or seek additional financing through other arrangements 
any sale of additional equity or debt securities may result in additional dilution to our stockholders  and we cannot be certain that additional public or private financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain this additional financing  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of  or eliminate one or more of our planned research  development and commercialization activities  which could harm our financial condition and operating results 
contractual obligations our long term contractual obligations include commitments and estimated purchase obligations entered into in the normal course of business 
these include inventory related commitments to manufacture our products  research and development service agreements  operating leases and other selling and general administrative related obligations 
future estimated contractual obligations are contractual obligations later years total inventory related commitments   research and development    operating leases     selling  general and administrative  total contractual obligations    included above are inventory related non cancellable commitments to make payments to ucb bioproducts of a total of million during for angiomax bulk drug substance to be produced using the chemilog process and million in related filling  finishing and packaging commitments through august we also have million of estimated contractual obligations for research and development activities of which million is non cancellable 
the amounts included in selling  general and administrative obligations are primarily related to non cancellable consulting arrangements 
in addition to the contractual obligations above  we have agreed to make payments upon the achievement of sales and regulatory milestones  and agreed to pay royalties  to biogen idec  inc and to astrazeneca ab under our product license agreements for angiomax  clevelox and cangrelor 
under the angiomax license  we have agreed to pay up to an additional million upon the first commercial sales of angiomax for the treatment of acute myocardial infarction in the united states and europe 
under the clevelox license  we have agreed to pay up to an additional million upon reaching certain regulatory milestones 
under the cangrelor license  we have made an upfront payment and will provide milestone payments upon regulatory approval in major markets 
factors that may affect future results this annual report on form k includes forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  and section a of the securities act of  as amended 
for this purpose  any statements contained herein regarding our strategy  future operations  financial position  future revenues  projected costs  prospects  plans and objectives of management  other than statements of historical facts  are forward looking statements

we cannot guarantee that we actually will achieve the plans  intentions or expectations expressed or implied in our forward looking statements 
there are a number of important factors that could cause actual results  levels of activity  performance or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward looking statements we make 
these important factors include our critical accounting estimates and the risk factors set forth below 
although we may elect to update forward looking statements in the future  we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so  even if our estimates change  and readers should not rely on those forward looking statements as representing our views as of any date subsequent to the date of this annual report 
risks related to our business we have a history of net losses and may not achieve or maintain profitability we have incurred net losses on an annual basis since our inception  including a net loss of approximately million for the year ended december  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we expect to make substantial expenditures to further develop and commercialize our products  including costs and expenses associated with clinical trials  regulatory approvals and commercialization 
although we achieved profitability for the three months ended december   in light of our planned expenditures  we will likely need to generate significantly greater revenues to maintain profitability 
we remain unsure as to when we will become profitable on an annual basis  if at all  or whether we will remain profitable for any substantial period of time 
if we fail to achieve profitability on an annual basis within the time frame expected by investors or securities analysts  the market price of our common stock may decline 
our business is very dependent on the commercial success of angiomax angiomax is our only commercial product and  we expect  will account for almost all of our revenues for the foreseeable future 
the commercial success of angiomax will depend upon its continued acceptance by regulators  physicians  patients and other key decision makers as a safe  therapeutic and cost effective alternative to heparin and other products used in current practice  or currently being developed 
if angiomax is not commercially successful  we will have to find additional sources of funding or curtail or cease operations 
near term growth in our sales of angiomax is highly dependent on physician acceptance of the replace trial in the fall of  we completed a  patient post marketing phase b clinical trial of angiomax in coronary angioplasty called replace in november  the principal investigators of the clinical trial announced that  based on day patient follow up results  angiomax met all of the primary and secondary objectives of the trial 
in march  we released the results of the detailed cost analysis study to examine per patient total hospital resource consumption at us clinical trial sites 
in september  the principal investigators of the clinical trial further announced that  based on six month patient follow up results  angiomax again met all of the primary and secondary objectives of the trial 
in november  the principal instigators presented one year follow up mortality data from the trial  which confirmed the day and six month mortality results 
we believe that the near term commercial success of angiomax will depend upon the extent to which physicians  patients and other key decision makers accept the results of the replace trial 
since the original results were announced  additional hospitals have granted angiomax formulary approval and hospital demand for the product has increased 
we cannot be certain  however  that these trends will continue 
some commentators have challenged various aspects of the trial design of replace  the conduct of the study and the analysis and interpretation of the results from the study  including how we define bleeding and the clinical relevance of types of ischemic events 
if physicians  patients and other key decision makers do not accept the trial results  adoption of angiomax may suffer  and our business will be materially adversely affected 
we cannot expand the indications for which we are marketing angiomax unless we receive fda approval for each additional indication 
failure to expand these indications will limit the size of the commercial market for angiomax in december  we received approval from the fda for the use of angiomax as an anticoagulant in combination with aspirin in patients with unstable angina undergoing coronary angioplasty 
one of our key objectives is to expand the indications for which angiomax is approved for marketing by the fda 
in order to market angiomax for these expanded indications  we will need to complete our clinical trials that are currently underway  conduct additional clinical trials  obtain positive results from those trials and obtain fda approval for such proposed indications 
if we are unsuccessful in expanding the approved indications for the use of angiomax  the size of the commercial market for angiomax will be limited 
failure to obtain regulatory approval in foreign jurisdictions will prevent us from marketing angiomax abroad we intend to market angiomax through distribution partners in international markets  including europe 
in order to market angiomax in the european union and many other foreign jurisdictions  we or our distribution partners must obtain separate regulatory approvals 
obtaining foreign approvals may require additional trials and expense 
in february  we submitted a marketing authorization application  or maa  to the european agency for evaluation of medicinal products  or the emea  for use of angiomax in unstable angina patients undergoing coronary angioplasty 
following extended interaction with european regulatory authorities  the committee of proprietary medicinal products of the emea voted in october not to recommend angiomax for approval in coronary angioplasty  and we withdrew our application to the emea 
in august  we resubmitted an maa with the results of the replace trial  and we are in discussions with regulatory authorities regarding the resubmitted maa 
we may not be able to obtain approval or may be delayed in obtaining approval from any or all of the jurisdictions in which we seek approval to market angiomax 
the development and commercialization of our products may be terminated or delayed  and the costs of development and commercialization may increase  if third parties on which we rely to manufacture and support the development and commercialization of our products do not fulfill their obligations our development and commercialization strategy entails entering into arrangements with corporate and academic collaborators  contract research organizations  distributors  third party manufacturers  licensors  licensees and others to conduct development work  manage our clinical trials  manufacture our products and market and sell our products outside of the united states 
we do not have the expertise or the resources to conduct such activities on our own and  as a result  are particularly dependent on third parties in most areas 
we may not be able to maintain our existing arrangements with respect to the commercialization of angiomax or establish and maintain arrangements to develop and commercialize clevelox  cangrelor or any additional product candidates or products we may acquire on terms that are acceptable to us 
any current or future arrangements for development and commercialization may not be successful 
if we are not able to establish or maintain agreements relating to angiomax  clevelox  cangrelor or any additional products we may acquire on terms that we deem favorable  our results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
third parties may not perform their obligations as expected 
the amount and timing of resources that third parties devote to developing  manufacturing and commercializing our products are not within our control 
furthermore  our interests may differ from those of third parties that manufacture or commercialize our products 
disagreements that may arise with these third parties could delay or lead to the termination of the development or commercialization of our product candidates  or result in litigation or arbitration  which would be time consuming and expensive 
if any third party that manufactures or supports the development or commercialization of our products breaches or terminates its agreement with us  or fails to conduct its activities in a timely manner  such breach  termination or failure could delay or otherwise adversely impact the development or commercialization of angiomax  clevelox  cangrelor or any additional products that we may acquire or develop  require us to undertake unforeseen additional responsibilities or devote unforeseen additional resources to the development or commercialization of our products  or result in the termination of the development or commercialization of our products 
failure to achieve our revenue targets or raise additional funds in the future may affect the development  manufacture and sale of our products we will need to generate significantly greater revenues to achieve and then maintain profitability on an annual basis 
the product development  including clinical trials  manufacturing development and regulatory approvals  of angiomax for additional indications  clevelox and cangrelor  and the acquisition and development of additional product candidates by us will require a commitment of substantial funds 
our future funding requirements depend upon many factors  including our ability to achieve our revenue targets  and may be significantly greater than we expect 
as of the date of this annual report  we believe  based on our current operating plan  which includes anticipated revenues from angiomax and interest income  that our current cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities will be sufficient to fund our operations into and beyond  without requiring us to obtain external financing 
if our existing resources are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements due to slower than anticipated sales of angiomax or otherwise  or if we acquire additional product candidates  we may need to sell additional equity or debt securities or seek additional financing through other arrangements 
any sale of additional equity or debt securities may result in additional dilution to our stockholders  and we cannot be certain that additional public or private financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain this additional financing  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of  or eliminate one or more of our planned research  development and commercialization activities  which could harm our financial condition and operating results 
in addition  in order to obtain additional financing  we may be required to relinquish rights to products  product candidates or technologies that we would not otherwise relinquish 
we depend on single suppliers for the production of angiomax and clevelox bulk drug substance and different single suppliers to carry out all fill finish activities we do not manufacture any of our products and do not plan to develop any capacity to manufacture them 
as of the date of this annual report  we obtain all of our angiomax bulk drug substance from one manufacturer  ucb bioproducts  and rely on another manufacturer  ben venue laboratories  to carry out all fill finish activities for angiomax  which includes final formulation and transfer of the drug into vials where it is then freeze dried and sealed 
the terms of our agreement with ucb bioproducts require us to purchase a substantial portion of our angiomax bulk drug product from ucb bioproducts  which could hinder our ability to obtain an additional supplier for angiomax 
as of the date of this annual report  we obtain all of our clevelox bulk drug substance for use in clinical trials from one manufacturer  pharm eco  a johnson matthey company 
we will rely on a different single supplier  fresnius kabi clayton  lp  and its proprietary formulation technology  for the manufacture of all finished clevelox product  as well as release testing and clinical packaging 
the fda requires that all manufacturers of pharmaceuticals for sale in or from the united states achieve and maintain compliance with the fda s current good manufacturing practices  or cgmp  regulations and guidelines 
there are a limited number of manufacturers that operate under cgmp regulations capable of manufacturing angiomax 
as of the date of this annual report  we do not have alternative sources for production of angiomax bulk drug substance or to carry out fill finish activities 
in the event that either ucb bioproducts or ben venue is unable to carry out its respective manufacturing obligations  we may be unable to obtain alternative manufacturing  or obtain such manufacturing on commercially reasonable terms or on a timely basis 
if we were required to transfer manufacturing processes to other third party manufacturers  we would be required to satisfy various regulatory requirements  which could cause us to experience significant delays in receiving an adequate supply of angiomax 
any delays in the manufacturing process may adversely impact our ability to meet commercial demands for angiomax on a timely basis and supply product for clinical trials of angiomax 
we do not own the technology underlying the chemilog process and may be unable to utilize the chemilog process if ucb bioproducts breaches our agreement our agreement with ucb bioproducts for the supply of angiomax bulk drug substance provides that ucb bioproducts owns all of the proprietary technology that was used to develop the chemilog process 
although the agreement requires that ucb bioproducts transfer this technology to a secondary supplier of angiomax bulk drug substance or to us or an alternate supplier at the expiration of the agreement  if ucb bioproducts fails or is unable to transfer successfully this technology  we would be unable to employ the chemilog process to manufacture our angiomax bulk drug substance  which could cause us to experience delays in the manufacturing process and increase our manufacturing costs in the future 
clinical trials of product candidates are expensive and time consuming  and the results of these trials are uncertain before we can obtain regulatory approvals to market any product for a particular indication  we will be required to complete pre clinical studies and extensive clinical trials in humans to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of such product for such indication 
as of the date of this annual report  we are evaluating angiomax in clinical trials for additional uses in open vascular surgery such as cabg surgery  in medical conditions that require urgent treatment such as unstable angina  in patients with heparin allergy  in children and in peripheral angioplasty 
as of the date of this annual report  we have commenced a phase trial program in patients undergoing cardiac surgery to investigate the potential of clevelox to simplify and improve the treatment of these patients 
there are numerous factors that could delay our clinical trials or prevent us from completing our trials successfully 
we  or the fda  may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds  including a finding that patients are being exposed to unacceptable health risks 
the rate of completion of clinical trials depends in part upon the rate of enrollment of patients 
patient enrollment is a function of many factors  including the size of the patient population  the proximity of patients to clinical sites  the eligibility criteria for the trial  the existence of competing clinical trials and the availability of alternative or new treatments 
in particular  the patient population targeted by some of our clinical trials may be small 
delays in future planned patient enrollment may result in increased costs and program delays 
in addition  clinical trials  if completed  may not show a product candidate to be safe or effective for the intended use 
results obtained in pre clinical studies or early clinical trials are not always indicative of results that will be obtained in later clinical trials 
moreover  data obtained from pre clinical studies and clinical trials may be subject to varying interpretations 
as a result  the fda or other applicable regulatory authorities may not approve a product in a timely fashion  or at all 
even if regulatory approval to market a product is granted  the regulatory approval may impose limitations on the indicated use for which the product may be marketed 
our failure to acquire and develop additional product candidates or approved products will impair our ability to grow we have a single product approved for marketing 
in order to generate additional revenues  we intend to acquire and develop additional product candidates or approved products 
the success of this growth strategy depends upon our ability to identify  select and acquire pharmaceutical products that meet the criteria we have established 
because we neither have  nor intend to establish  internal scientific research capabilities  we are dependent upon pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and other researchers to sell or license product candidates to us 
we will be required to integrate any acquired products into our existing operations 
managing the development of a new product entails numerous financial and operational risks  including difficulties in attracting qualified employees to develop the product 
any product candidate we acquire will require additional research and development efforts prior to commercial sale  including extensive pre clinical and or clinical testing and approval by the fda and corresponding foreign regulatory authorities 
all product candidates are prone to the risks of failure inherent in pharmaceutical product development  including the possibility that the product candidate will not be safe  non toxic and effective or approved by regulatory authorities 
in addition  we cannot assure you that any approved products that we develop or acquire will be manufactured or produced economically  successfully commercialized  or widely accepted in the marketplace 
we have previously acquired rights to products and  after having conducted development activities  determined not to devote further resources to those products 
we cannot assure you that any additional products that we acquire will be successfully developed 
in addition  proposing  negotiating and implementing an economically viable acquisition is a lengthy and complex process 
other companies  including those with substantially greater financial  marketing and sales resources  may compete with us for the acquisition of product candidates and approved products 
we may not be able to acquire the rights to additional product candidates and approved products on terms that we find acceptable  or at all 
a breach of any of the agreements under which we license commercialization rights to products or technology from others could cause us to lose license rights that are important to our business or subject us to claims by our licensors we license rights to products and technology that are important to our business  and we expect to enter into additional licenses in the future 
for instance  we have exclusively licensed patents and patent applications relating to angiomax from biogen and relating to clevelox and cangrelor from astrazeneca 
under these agreements  we are subject to commercialization and development  sublicensing  royalty  patent prosecution and maintenance  insurance and other obligations 
any failure by us to comply with any of these obligations or any other breach by us of these license agreements could give the licensor the right to terminate the license in whole  terminate the exclusive nature of the license or bring a claim against us for damages 
any such termination or claim  particularly relating to our agreement with biogen  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
even if we contest any such termination or claim and are ultimately successful  our stock price could suffer 
in addition  upon any termination of a license agreement  we may be required to license to the licensor any related intellectual property that we developed 
we may not be able to manage our business effectively if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel and consultants our industry has experienced a high rate of turnover of management personnel in recent years 
we are highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel for the acquisition  development and commercialization activities we conduct or sponsor 
if we lose one or more of the members of our senior management  including our executive chairman  dr 
clive a 
meanwell  or our chief executive officer  david m 
stack  or other key employees or consultants  our ability to implement successfully our business strategy could be seriously harmed 
our ability to replace these key employees may be difficult and may take an extended period of time because of the limited number of individuals in our industry with the breadth of skills and experience required to acquire  develop and commercialize products successfully 
competition to hire from this limited pool is intense  and we may be unable to hire  train  retain or motivate such additional personnel 
because the market for thrombin inhibitors is competitive  our product may not obtain widespread use we have positioned angiomax as a replacement for heparin  which is a widely used  inexpensive  generic drug used in patients with arterial thrombosis 
because heparin is inexpensive and has been widely used for many years  physicians and medical decision makers may be hesitant to adopt angiomax 
in addition  due to the high incidence and severity of cardiovascular diseases  competition in the market for thrombin inhibitors is intense and growing 
there are a number of direct and indirect thrombin inhibitors currently on the market  awaiting regulatory approval and in development  including orally administered agents 
the thrombin inhibitors on the market include products for use in the treatment of patients with a clinical condition known as hit hitts  patients with unstable angina and patients with deep vein thrombosis 
angiomax may compete with all groups of anticoagulant drugs  including platelet inhibitors and fibrinolytic drugs  which may limit the use of angiomax in general  anticoagulant drugs may be classified into four groups drugs that directly target and inhibit thrombin  drugs that indirectly target and inhibit thrombin  drugs that target and inhibit platelets and drugs that break down fibrin 
because each group of anticoagulants acts on different components of the clotting process  we believe that there will be continued clinical work to determine the best combination of drugs for clinical use 
we expect angiomax to be used with aspirin alone or in conjunction with platelet inhibitors or fibrinolytic drugs 
although platelet inhibitors and fibrinolytic drugs may be complementary to angiomax  we recognize that angiomax may compete with these and other anticoagulant drugs to the extent angiomax and any of these anticoagulant drugs are approved for the same indication 
in addition  platelet inhibitors and fibrinolytic drugs may compete with angiomax for the use of hospital financial resources 
for example  many us hospitals receive a fixed reimbursement amount per procedure for the angioplasties and other treatment therapies they perform 
because this amount is not based on the actual expenses the hospital incurs  hospitals may be forced to use either angiomax or platelet inhibitors or fibrinolytic drugs but not necessarily several of the drugs together 
we face substantial competition  which may result in others discovering  developing or commercializing competing products before or more successfully than we do our industry is highly competitive 
our success will depend on our ability to acquire and develop products and apply technology  and our ability to establish and maintain markets for our products 
potential competitors in the united states and other countries include major pharmaceutical and chemical companies  specialized pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology firms  universities and other research institutions 
many of our competitors have substantially greater research and development capabilities and experience  and greater manufacturing  marketing and financial resources  than we do 
accordingly  our competitors may develop or license products or other novel technologies that are more effective  safer or less costly than existing products or technologies or products or technologies that are being developed by us or may obtain fda approval for products more rapidly than we are able 
technological development by others may render our products or product candidates noncompetitive 
we may not be successful in establishing or maintaining technological competitiveness 
fluctuations in our operating results could affect the price of our common stock our operating results may vary from period to period based on factors including the amount and timing of sales of angiomax  the availability and timely delivery of a sufficient supply of angiomax  the timing and expenses of clinical trials  announcements regarding clinical trial results and product introductions by us or our competitors  the availability and timing of third party reimbursement and the timing of regulatory approvals 
if our operating results do not match the expectations of securities analysts and investors as a result of these and other factors  the trading price of our common stock will likely decrease 
we may undertake strategic acquisitions in the future and any difficulties from integrating such acquisitions could damage our ability to attain or maintain profitability we may acquire additional businesses and products that complement or augment our existing business 
integrating any newly acquired business or product could be expensive and time consuming 
we may not be able to integrate any acquired business or product successfully or operate any acquired business profitably 
moreover  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financing to acquire any businesses or products  which may result in dilution for stockholders and the incurrence of indebtedness 
our revenues are substantially dependent on a limited number of wholesalers to which we sell angiomax  and such revenues may fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on the buying patterns of these wholesalers we sell angiomax primarily to a limited number of national medical and pharmaceutical distributors and wholesalers with distribution centers located throughout the united states 
during the year ended december   revenues from the sale of angiomax to three wholesalers totaled approximately of our net revenues 
our reliance on this small number of wholesalers could cause our revenues to fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on the buying patterns of these wholesalers 
in addition  if any of these wholesalers fails to pay us on a timely basis or at all  our financial position and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
risks related to our industry if we do not obtain fda approvals for our products or comply with government regulations  we may not be able to market our products and may be subject to stringent penalties except for angiomax  which has been approved for sale in the united states for use as an anticoagulant in patients undergoing coronary angioplasty  and which has been approved for sale in five other countries for indications similar to that approved by the fda  we do not have a product approved for sale in the united states or any foreign market 
we must obtain approval from the fda in order to sell our product candidates in the united states and from foreign regulatory authorities in order to sell our product candidates in other countries 
we must successfully complete our clinical trials and demonstrate manufacturing capability before we can file with the fda for approval to sell our products 
the fda could require additional studies as part of the regulatory review process 
delays in obtaining or failure to obtain regulatory approvals may delay or prevent the successful commercialization of any of our product candidates  diminish our competitive advantage  and defer or decrease our receipt of revenues or royalties 
the regulatory review and approval process is lengthy  expensive and uncertain 
extensive pre clinical data  clinical data and supporting information must be submitted to the fda for each additional indication to obtain such approvals  and we cannot be certain when we will receive these regulatory approvals  if ever 
in addition to initial regulatory approval  our product and product candidates are subject to extensive and rigorous ongoing domestic and foreign government regulation of  among other things  the research  development  testing  manufacture  labeling  promotion  advertising  distribution and marketing of our products and product candidates 
any approvals  once obtained  may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or safety problems are identified 
failure to comply with these requirements may also subject us to stringent penalties 
we may not be able to obtain or maintain patent protection for our products  and we may infringe the patent rights of others the patent positions of pharmaceutical companies like us are generally uncertain and involve complex legal  scientific and factual issues 
our success depends significantly on our ability to obtain and maintain us and foreign patents  protect trade secrets  operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others  and prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights 
we may not have any additional patents issued from any patent applications that we own or license 
if additional patents are granted  the claims allowed may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology 
in addition  issued patents that we own or license may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
our patents also may not afford us protection against competitors with similar technology 
because patent applications in the united states and many foreign jurisdictions are typically not published until eighteen months after filing and because publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind actual discoveries  we cannot be certain that others have not filed or maintained patent applications for technology used by us or covered by our pending patent applications without our being aware of these applications 
we exclusively license us patents and patent applications and corresponding foreign patents and patent applications relating to angiomax  clevelox  cangrelor and ctv as of the date of this annual report  we exclusively license six issued us patents relating to angiomax  three issued us patents relating to clevelox  four issued us patents relating to cangrelor and three issued us patents relating to ctv the principal us patent that covers angiomax expires in the us patent and trademark office has rejected our application for an extension of the term of the patent beyond because the application was not filed on time 
we are exploring an alternative to extend the term of the patent  but we can provide no assurance that we will be successful 
we have not yet filed any independent patent applications 
we may not hold proprietary rights to some patents related to our product candidates 
in some cases  others may own or control these patents 
as a result  we may be required to obtain licenses under third party patents to market some of our product candidates 
if licenses are not available to us on acceptable terms  we will not be able to market these products 
we may become a party to patent litigation or other proceedings regarding intellectual property rights 
the cost to us of any patent litigation or other proceeding  even if resolved in our favor  could be substantial 
if any patent litigation or other intellectual property proceeding in which we are involved is resolved unfavorably to us  we may be enjoined from manufacturing or selling our products without a license from the other party  and we may be held liable for significant damages 
we may not be able to obtain any required license on commercially acceptable terms  or at all 
if we are not able to keep our trade secrets confidential  our technology and information may be used by others to compete against us we rely significantly upon unpatented proprietary technology  information  processes and know how 
we seek to protect this information by confidentiality agreements with our employees  consultants and other third party contractors  as well as through other security measures 
we may not have adequate remedies for any breach by a party to these confidentiality agreements 
in addition  our competitors may learn or independently develop our trade secrets 
we could be exposed to significant liability claims if we are unable to obtain insurance at acceptable costs and adequate levels or otherwise protect ourselves against potential product liability claims our business exposes us to potential product liability risks  which are inherent in the testing  manufacturing  marketing and sale of human healthcare products 
product liability claims might be made by patients in clinical trials  consumers  health care providers or pharmaceutical companies or others that sell our products 
these claims may be made even with respect to those products that are manufactured in licensed and regulated facilities or otherwise possess regulatory approval for commercial sale 
these claims could expose us to significant liabilities that could prevent or interfere with the development or commercialization of our products 
product liability claims could require us to spend significant time and money in litigation or pay significant damages 
as of the date of this annual report  we are covered  with respect to our commercial sales and our clinical trials  by primary product liability insurance in the amount of million per occurrence and million annually in the aggregate on a claims made basis 
this coverage may not be adequate to cover any product liability claims 
as we commercialize our products  we may wish to increase our product liability insurance 
product liability coverage is expensive 
in the future  we may not be able to maintain or obtain such product liability insurance on reasonable terms  at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to product liability claims 
our ability to generate future revenue from products will depend on reimbursement and drug pricing acceptable levels of reimbursement of drug treatments by government authorities  private health insurers and other organizations will have an effect on our ability to successfully commercialize  and attract collaborative partners to invest in the development of  product candidates 
we cannot be sure that reimbursement in the united states or elsewhere will be available for any products we may develop or  if already available  will not be decreased in the future 
if reimbursement is not available or is available only to limited levels  we may not be able to commercialize our products  and may not be able to obtain a satisfactory financial return on our products 
third party payers increasingly are challenging prices charged for medical products and services 
also  the trend toward managed health care in the united states and the changes in health insurance programs  as well as legislative proposals to reform health care or reduce government insurance programs  may result in lower prices for pharmaceutical products  including any products that may be offered by us 
cost cutting measures that health care providers are instituting  and the effect of any health care reform  could materially adversely affect our ability to sell any products that are successfully developed by us and approved by regulators 
moreover  we are unable to predict what additional legislation or regulation  if any  relating to the health care industry or third party coverage and reimbursement may be enacted in the future or what effect such legislation or regulation would have on our business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market risk is the risk of change in fair value of a financial instrument due to changes in interest rates  equity prices  creditworthiness  financing  exchange rates or other factors 
our primary market risk exposure relates to changes in interest rates in our cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities 
we place our investments in high quality financial instruments  primarily money market funds  corporate debt and us government agency securities with maturities or auction dates of less than one year  which we believe are subject to limited interest rate and credit risk 
we currently do not hedge interest rate exposure 
at december   we held million in cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities which had an average interest rate of approximately 
of this amount  approximately of the cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities were due on demand or within one year and had an average interest rate of approximately of 
the remaining were due within two years and had an average interest rate of approximately 
most of our transactions are conducted in us dollars 
we do have certain agreements with parties located outside the united states 
transactions under certain of these agreements are conducted in us dollars  subject to adjustment based on significant fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
transactions under certain other of these agreements are conducted in the local foreign currency 
if the applicable exchange rate undergoes a change of  we do not believe that it would have a material impact on our results of operations or cash flows
