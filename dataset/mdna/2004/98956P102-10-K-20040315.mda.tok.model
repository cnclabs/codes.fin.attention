item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the corresponding notes included elsewhere in this form k 
this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements 
overview the company is a global leader in the design  development  manufacture and marketing of reconstructive orthopaedic implants  including joint and dental  spinal implants  and trauma products and related orthopaedic surgical products 
orthopaedic reconstructive implants restore joint function lost due to disease or trauma in joints such as knees  hips  shoulders and elbows 
dental reconstructive implants restore function and aesthetics in patients that have lost teeth due to trauma or disease 
spinal implants are utilized by orthopaedic surgeons and neurosurgeons in the treatment of degenerative diseases  deformities and trauma in all regions of the spine 
trauma products are devices used primarily to reattach or stabilize damaged bone and tissue to support the body s natural healing process 
the company s related orthopaedic surgical products include supplies and instruments designed to aid in orthopaedic surgical procedures 
with operations in more than countries and products marketed in more than countries  operations are managed through three reportable geographic segments the americas  europe and asia pacific 
events affecting operating performance in centerpulse results of operations have been included in the company s results subsequent to the completion of that acquisition on october   and their respective assets and liabilities have been recorded at their estimated fair values in the company s consolidated statement of financial position as of october   with the excess purchase price being allocated to goodwill 
the pending acquisition of implex gives the company enhanced flexibility in the development of products using trabecular metal technology  which the company believes has significant potential in orthopaedic reconstructive and spinal product applications 
the company continues to make significant progress in the development and introduction of mis procedures and technologies 
this includes the continued rollout of the zimmer mis incision hip replacement procedure  and the development of the mis quad sparing total knee procedure that the company introduced at the american academy of orthopaedic surgeons meeting in san francisco 
the company believes such innovative approaches will significantly impact the orthopaedics industry 
since its opening in march  the zimmer institute in warsaw  indiana has seen extensive use for mis education  new product development meetings and sales training programs 
during the year  the company continued to expand the zimmer institute s global affiliations 
with the acquisition of centerpulse  the company begins an exciting new chapter in its history 
the successful integration of the centerpulse business  which began in the fourth quarter  is the company s critical objective for the near term 
more than full time personnel from zimmer  centerpulse and independent professional service organizations are managing more than major integration projects for over legal entities in different countries 
the integration process  under the direction of the company s senior management team  continues to advance 
the company has made substantial progress in developing global combined product strategies  in integrating the company s us sales and european business organizations  and in melding essential activities as diverse as global accounting principles and e mail systems 
during the year  the company recorded million pre tax of acquisition and integration costs for contract terminations  professional fees  employee severance  retention pay  employee relocation costs and other expenses 
in  the company expects to incur another million for similar costs and expenses as integration progresses 
the company s operating results in the fourth quarter  the first quarter for which it reported combined results  indicated that the acquisition of centerpulse was accretive to our shareholders  excluding acquisition and integration expenses  in process r d write off and inventory step up 
the company s combined gross margin  in the fourth quarter  including an inventory step up charge of million  was percent directly related to geographic and product mix  price and strong manufacturing performance 
the company believes that its reported gross margin for the fourth quarter  which reflects the combination with centerpulse and the consequently higher european revenue content  remains strong 
other important financial metrics include the company s level of spending on research and development and its selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales 
the company expects over the next couple of years to continue to invest in research and development at almost percent of sales  as investments in spine  biologics and new technology increase 
in management s view  the company s selling  general and administrative expenses are well managed  closing out the fourth quarter at percent of revenue 
despite the strong operating performance in the fourth quarter  the company expects to realize approximately million in sales dis synergies in the company believes it is possible  given the complexity of the centerpulse combination  that its reconstructive revenue growth in europe  for example  may lag the european reconstructive market as the company works through integration challenges in key markets such as france  italy and germany 
economic and industry wide factors relevant to the company 
on a worldwide basis  price improvement has remained firm at percent in the last two years 
the company realized better than expected growth in average zimmer holdings  inc 
and subsidiaries form k selling prices at percent in its most recent quarter in the americas  the company s largest operating segment 
although the industry has experienced steady growth in price in the last few years  the company expects price growth to moderate in the near term and settle in at rates of percent for pressure from healthcare cost containment efforts may affect prices in markets where health care spending grows at a rate higher than the local economy 
even though the clinical benefits of joint replacement products and fixation devices are well documented  the orthopaedic industry could be subject to such efforts by various consumers of healthcare in different parts of the world 
in japan  as an example  where hospital reimbursement prices for medical devices are set by the ministry of health  labor and welfare  the company expects pricing to decline percent in mid to late as compared with the more traditional percent decline experienced in prior bi annual price adjustments 
another important factor affecting the industry is global demand for orthopaedic devices 
orthopaedic procedure volume on a worldwide basis continues to rise at mid to high single digit rates driven by an aging global population  proven clinical benefits  new material technologies  advances in surgical techniques such as our mis procedures and technologies and more active lifestyles  among other factors 
adoption rates for new technologies are another key indicator of industry performance 
in the company s business  revenue has grown with the introduction of new products such as longevity highly crosslinked polyethylene liners which accounted for percent of the company s total liner sales in its first year of introduction and now comprises over percent of the company s liner sales 
the centerpulse companion product durasul highly crosslinked polyethylene was up percent in the fourth quarter 
crosslinked polyethylene products generally demand a higher price than standard liners due to anticipated improvement in wear characteristics  as demonstrated in laboratory tests 
in  the company introduced prolong crosslinked polyethylene for the knee  which is also sold at a premium to standard articulating surfaces 
in the fourth quarter  prolong represented approximately percent of all cruciate retaining articulating surface product sales and percent of all articulating surfaces 
while the price premium is significant on this product  the company believes its ultimate impact of resistance to delamination has potentially far ranging medical and economic benefits 
adoption rates for the company s new products associated with crosslinked polyethylene  mis procedures and technologies  trabecular metal  knee and hip revision products  interpositional knee devices  and new trauma  spine and dental devices will continue to affect the company s operating performance 
in recognition of the importance of the successful introduction of new technologies  zimmer has developed a full time department called health technology assessment and reimbursement 
this department has supported the collection and analysis of clinical data to determine the economic effects of certain surgical procedures and the use of the company s products 
another important factor affecting operating performance is foreign currency fluctuations 
with a significant portion of the company s revenue derived from sales of its products outside of the united states  revenues and operating results are affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations 
a weakening us dollar throughout contributed to the growth in revenue reported in the year ended december   adding four percent of the percent reported revenue growth  excluding centerpulse product revenue 
the company addresses currency risk management through regular operating and financing activities  and under appropriate circumstances and subject to proper authorization  through the use of derivative financial instruments solely for hedging purposes 
the use of derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes is prohibited 
an evolving trend which may affect the industry and the company s operating performance in the future is connected with how the industry markets its products 
industry players have recently turned to direct to consumer dtc advertising and promotion as a means of promoting new products and technologies 
as this development is in its beginning stages  it is not possible to predict how this may affect operating performance  if at all  in the future 
the company has engaged in relatively low cost dtc campaigns in connection with the launch of its nexgen lps flex knee and to publicly reach out to patients while working with surgeons to introduce mis technologies and procedures 
the company has made use of the zimmer owned web site  pacewithlife 
com  which in resulted in  find a doc requests and almost  marketing packets mailed 
and the company s mis adword campaigns had more than  click thru s on nearly one million impressions 
the company s six month national public relations campaign in completed the year with almost placements and reached audiences of close to million people 
while certain competitors are now engaged in more expensive national advertising  the company is currently satisfied with the returns it has experienced with its low cost dtc campaigns 
lastly  among the many factors that affect operating performance within the industry is the development and protection of intellectual property 
in  the company was granted a patent by the us patent and trademark office for the zimmer mis incision hip replacement procedure 
the patent includes approved claims 
in addition to the issued patent  five more zimmer mis incision hip procedure patents are pending with a total of additional claims identified relating to the surgical technique and instrumentation 
similarly  and equally important  the us patent and trademark office has issued patents for the company s transformational technology mis hip fracture fixation system with product and procedure claims approved and five patents and claims outstanding 
furthermore  the company has seven patents pending related to its unique mis quad sparing or qs total knee procedure with a total of claims covering novel aspects of the procedure and instrumentation  as well as new implant designs 
the company believes there is significant potential zimmer holdings  inc 
and subsidiaries form k value in the us patent and trademark office recognizing that the company has developed something sufficiently unique to deserve a patent

gross profit as a percentage of net sales was percent in compared to percent in gross profit for was reduced million  or percent of net sales  as a result of an inventory step up charge recognized in connection with the centerpulse acquisition 
sales and gross profit from centerpulse also reduced reported gross margins as centerpulse has a greater percentage of sales based in europe  where gross margins are historically lower than the us and japan 
increased zimmer standalone average selling prices in all geographic segments  the continued conversion from cemented implants to higher margin porous implants and the ongoing efforts to reduce manufacturing costs through automation  in sourcing and process improvements had positive impacts on gross profit 
the company s operating plans annually call for reductions in unit manufacturing cost of its products as a direct result of a number of factors  including but not limited to  increased volume  improvements in material technology  replacement of used machinery and equipment with higher speed equipment  changes in the configuration of manufacturing cells designed to increase throughput  labor automation as well as in sourcing 
focus on inventory cost reduction is a strategic imperative 
the company will continue to direct efforts on driving down costs of products sold  general and administrative expenses and holding costs associated with working capital

research and development expense increased to million from million reflecting research and development expenses from centerpulse and increased spending on active projects focused on areas of strategic significance  including mis technologies  innovative materials such as trabecular metal and highly crosslinked polyethylene  lifestyle designs  revision implants and biological solutions 
the company has strategically targeted r d spending to be at the high end of what management believes to be an average of percent for the industry 
maintaining a robust product development pipeline has enabled zimmer to achieve significant contributions in revenue from new products  which management defines as products introduced within the prior month period 
for example  in the fourth quarter  new product revenue  excluding centerpulse  represented percent of sales  at the high end of the company s stated quarterly and annual goal of percent  in place since management expects over the next year or two to continue to invest in r d at almost percent of sales on a higher revenue base as investments in spine  biologics and new technology increase 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a as a percentage of net sales were percent in compared to percent percent assuming the change in accounting principle for instruments is applied retroactively in low cost inflation accompanied with double digit revenue growth has driven the overall expense ratio lower for the year 
detailed planning  monitoring and control over these expenses have also contributed to the improvement 
while well managed  the company has introduced programs and activities in that involve significant investments  which  in part  are reflected in sg a 
as an example  the zimmer institute has seen very active use in the zimmer institute  which is used for surgeon training  product development activities such as prototype evaluations and product and instrument training for independent field sales representatives  provided training for over surgeons  physician assistants and nurses on the mis incision hip replacement procedure and the spine is a new product category as a result of the centerpulse acquisition

and subsidiaries form k contractual obligations the company has entered into contracts with various third parties in the normal course of business which will require future payments 
the following table illustrates the company s contractual obligations less than after contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt capital leases operating leases purchase obligations other long term liabilities total contractual obligations critical accounting estimates the financial results of the company are affected by the selection and application of accounting policies and methods 
significant accounting policies which require management s judgment are discussed below 
excess inventory and instruments the company must determine as of each balance sheet date how much  if any  of its inventory may ultimately prove to be unsaleable or unsaleable at its carrying cost 
similarly  the company must also determine if instruments on hand will be put to productive use or remain undeployed as a result of excess supply 
reserves are established to effectively adjust inventory and instruments to net realizable value 
to determine the appropriate level of reserves  the company evaluates current stock levels in relation to historical and expected patterns of demand for all of its products and instrument systems and components 
the basis for the determination is generally the same for all inventory and instrument items and categories except for work in progress inventory  which is recorded at cost 
obsolete or discontinued items are generally destroyed and completely written off 
management evaluates the need for changes to valuation reserves based on market conditions  competitive offerings and other factors on a regular basis 
centerpulse historically applied a similar conceptual framework in estimating market value of excess inventory and instruments under international financial reporting standards and us generally accepted accounting principles 
within that framework  zimmer and centerpulse differed however  in certain respects  to their approaches to such estimation 
following the acquisition  the company determined that a consistent approach is necessary to maintaining effective control over financial reporting 
consideration was given to both approaches and the company established a common estimation technique taking both prior approaches into account 
this change in estimate resulted in a charge to earnings of million after tax in the fourth quarter 
such change is not considered material to the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
income taxes the company estimates income tax expense and income tax liabilities and assets by taxable jurisdiction 
realization of deferred tax assets in each taxable jurisdiction is dependent on the company s ability to generate future taxable income sufficient to realize the benefits 
the company evaluates deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis and provides valuation allowances if it is determined to be more likely than not that the deferred tax benefit will not be realized 
federal income taxes are provided on the portion of the income of foreign subsidiaries that is expected to be remitted to the us the company operates within numerous taxing jurisdictions 
the company is subject to regulatory review or audit in virtually all of those jurisdictions and those reviews and audits may require extended periods of time to resolve 
the company makes use of all available information and makes reasoned judgments regarding matters requiring interpretation in establishing tax expense  liabilities and reserves 
the company believes adequate provisions exist for income taxes for all periods and jurisdictions subject to review or audit 
commitments and contingencies accruals for product liability and other claims are established with internal and external counsel based on current information and historical settlement information for claims  related fees and for claims incurred but not reported 
an actuarial model is used by the company to assist management in determining an appropriate level of accruals for product liability claims 
historical patterns of claim loss development over time are statistically analyzed to arrive at factors which are then applied to loss estimates in the actuarial model 
the amounts established represent management s best estimate of the ultimate costs that it will incur under the various contingencies

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk the company is exposed to certain market risks as part of its ongoing business operations  including risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and commodity prices that could impact its financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the company manages its exposure to these and other market risks through regular operating and financing activities  and on a limited basis  through the use of derivative financial instruments 
derivative financial instruments are used solely as risk management tools and not for speculative investment foreign currency exchange risk the company operates on a global basis and is exposed to the risk that its financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company is primarily exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to its transactions and net assets denominated in swiss francs  japanese yen  euro  canadian dollars and australian dollars 
the company manages the foreign currency exposure centrally  on a combined basis  which allows the company to net exposures and to take advantage of any natural offsets 
in order to reduce the uncertainty of foreign exchange rate movements on transactions denominated in foreign currencies  the company enters into derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign exchange forward contracts with major international financial institutions 
these forward contracts are designed to hedge anticipated foreign currency transactions  primarily intercompany sale and purchase transactions  for periods consistent with commitments 
realized and unrealized gains and losses on these contracts that qualify as cash flow hedges are temporarily recorded in other comprehensive income  then recognized in earnings when the hedged item affects net earnings 
the notional amounts of outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts  principally japanese yen  euro  canadian dollars and australian dollars  entered into with third parties  at december  and  were million and million  respectively 
for all contracts outstanding at december   the company has an obligation to purchase us dollars and sell japanese yen  euro  canadian dollars and australian dollars at set maturity dates ranging from january through december the weighted average contract rates for and are yen usd and  usd euro and  canadian dollar usd and and usd australian dollar and  respectively 
the company maintains written policies and procedures governing its risk management activities 
the company s policy requires that critical terms of hedging instruments are the same as hedged forecasted transactions 
on this basis  with respect to cash flow hedges  changes in cash flows attributable to hedged transactions are generally expected to be completely offset by changes in the fair value of hedge instruments 
as part of its risk management program  the company furthermore performs sensitivity analyses to assess potential changes in revenue  operating results  cash flows and financial position relating to hypothetical movements in currency exchange rates 
a sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding at december   indicated that  if the us dollar uniformly changed in value by percent relative to the japanese yen  euro  canadian dollar and australian dollar  with no change in the interest differentials  the fair value of those contracts would increase or decrease earnings before income taxes  depending on the direction of the change  by an average approximate amount of million  million  million and million for the yen  euro  canadian dollar and australian dollar contracts  respectively 
any change in the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts as a result of a fluctuation in a currency exchange rate is expected to be largely offset by a change in the value of the hedged transaction 
consequently  foreign exchange contracts would not subject the company to material risk due to exchange rate movements because gains and losses on these contracts offset gains and losses on the assets  liabilities  and transactions being hedged 
the company had net investment exposures to net foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities of approximately  million and million at december  and  respectively  primarily in swiss francs  japanese yen and euro 
approximately  million of the net asset exposure at december  relates to goodwill and intangible assets recorded in the europe and asia pacific geographic segments as a result of the exchange offers 
commodity price risk the company purchases raw material commodities such as cobalt chrome  titanium  tantalum  polymer and sterile packaging 
the company enters into to month supply contracts  where available  on these commodities to alleviate the impact of market fluctuation in prices 
as part of the company s risk management program  sensitivity analyses related to potential commodity price changes are performed 
a percent price change across all these commodities would not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
zimmer holdings  inc 
and subsidiaries form k interest rate risk in the normal course of business  the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates that could impact its results of operations and financial condition 
the company manages its exposure to interest rate risks through its regular operations and financing activities 
presently  the company invests its cash and equivalents in money market and investment grade short term debt instruments 
the primary investment objective is to ensure capital preservation of its invested principal funds by limiting default and market risk 
currently  the company does not use derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio 
the company s exposure to interest rate risk arises principally from the short term rates associated with its credit facilities 
the company is subject to interest rate risk through movements in interest rates on the committed senior credit facility and its uncommitted credit facilities 
presently  all of its debt outstanding bears interest at short term rates 
the company currently does not hedge its interest rate exposure  but may do so in the future 
based upon the company s overall interest rate exposure as of december   a change of percent in interest rates or basis points  assuming the amount outstanding remains constant  would result in an annual increase of interest expense of approximately million 
however  due to the uncertainty of the actions that would be taken and their possible effects  this analysis assumes no such action  nor management actions to mitigate interest rate changes 
further  this analysis does not consider the effect of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
presently  the company intends to utilize cash flow to reduce outstanding borrowings 
credit risk financial instruments  which potentially subject the company to concentrations of credit risk  are primarily cash  cash equivalents  counterparty transactions  and accounts receivable 
the company places its investments in highly rated financial institutions and money market instruments  and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one entity 
the company does not believe it is exposed to any significant credit risk on its cash and equivalents and investments 
the company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the financial institutions with which it conducts business 
however  this loss is limited to the amounts  if any  by which the obligations of the counterparty to the financial instrument contract exceed the obligation of the company 
the company also minimizes exposure to credit risk by dealing with a diversified group of major financial institutions 
credit risk is managed through the monitoring of counterparty financial condition and by the use of standard credit guidelines 
the company does not anticipate any nonperformance by any of the counterparties 
concentration of credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivable is limited due to the large number of customers and their dispersion across a number of geographic areas and by frequent monitoring of the creditworthiness of the customers to whom credit is granted in the normal course of business 
however  essentially all of the company s trade receivables are concentrated in the public and private hospital and healthcare industry in the us and internationally or with distributors or dealers who operate in international markets and  accordingly  are exposed to their respective business  economic and country specific variables 
repayment is dependent upon the financial stability of these industry sectors and the respective countries national economic and health care systems 
exposure to credit risk is controlled through credit approvals  credit limits and monitoring procedures and the company believes that reserves for losses are adequate 
there is no significant net exposure due to any individual customer or other major concentration of credit risk
