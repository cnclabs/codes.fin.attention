item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources at december   scl s cash balances totaled  additionally  there were undrawn working capital bank lines amounting to approximately  changes in the cash position over the last three years can be summarized as follows dollars in thousands net cash provided by operating activities    proceeds from sale of ferry and other fixed assets   issuance of long term debt    issuance of shares  sale of oeh shares by scl   capital expenditures    acquisitions and investments  net of cash acquired  cash reduction from deconsolidation of oeh  principal payments under long term debt   principal payments on disposal of ferry and other fixed assets  debentures and senior notes retired    dividends on shares    purchase and retirement of oeh shares  working capital facilities and redrawable loans repaid drawn effect of exchange rate on cash and cash equivalents decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents   in  scl had a positive cash flow from operations after interest of    and proceeds from the sale of ferry and other fixed assets of    all of which were principally utilized to repay debt and fund capital expenditures  acquisitions and working capital  as was the case in and cash flow from operations decreased in from mainly due to decreased earnings from ferry and leisure operations including the effects of deconsolidating oeh in the fourth quarter of and increased working capital  offset in part by increased earnings from container operations  rail operations and other operations  a decrease in net finance costs resulting primarily from a reduction in interest expense due to a reduction in debt including the repayment of the and senior notes due july  which were not exchanged for senior notes due and lower interest rates on floating rate debt  together with increased undistributed earnings of affiliates including oeh and ge seaco investments offset by the effect of the acquisition of silja in 
cash flow from operations increased in from mainly due to increased earnings from ferry and rail operations  including the effect of consolidating silja from may   increased gains from the sale by scl of oeh shares and decreases in net finance costs and working capital  all partly offset by decreased earnings from container operations and leisure operations  including the effects of deconsolidating oeh in the fourth quarter of proceeds from bank borrowings in amounted to approximately    of which  nil   was drawn under loans secured by containers and related factory and depot assets  repayable mainly over five to ten years     was drawn under loans secured by ferry related assets  repayable over five to ten years    nil was drawn under loans secured by rail assets  repayable over three years  and    was drawn under term loans mainly secured by leisure and other assets and investments  repayable over five to seven years 
in december  the company sold  newly issued class a common shares in an sec registered public shelf offering raising net proceeds of about  this offering was completed in january when the company sold  additional shares raising net proceeds of about  these proceeds were added to scl s working capital 
in february  the company registered with the sec another shelf offering of  newly issued class a shares  but no shares have been sold to date 
also in february  the company announced it planned to make a public offering of up to  of new unsecured senior notes with an expected term of up to ten years for the purposes of repaying the company s senior subordinated debentures that mature on december  and other debt  funding possible acquisitions or adding to working capital 
in  scl sold in an sec registered public offering a total of  shares of oeh that scl owned  shares realizing net proceeds of  
this included the sale on november  of  oeh shares that resulted in the deconsolidation of oeh 
see note to the financial statements item below 
scl used the sale proceeds principally to repay debt and fund capital expenditures 
in january  oeh filed a registration statement with the sec relating to a further offering by scl of all of its remaining  shares in oeh 
no additional shares of oeh have been sold by scl to date under that registration statement 
in  scl made capital expenditures totalling approximately  relating primarily to the purchase and improvement of ferry related assets and container assets  and made no significant acquisitions or other investments during the year 
the majority of these expenditures was financed from medium or long term bank borrowings 
this contrasts with when scl made significant acquisitions and investments including scl s acquisition of of silja and oeh s acquisition of three hotels before it was deconsolidated from scl 
capital expenditures in are expected to be at a similar level to  and scl management believes these can be adequately funded from debt or lease financings  operating cash flow and other available cash sources including the public offerings referred to in the preceding paragraphs 
in  the company made an exchange offer of senior notes due for its outstanding  principal amount of and senior notes that matured on july   and a separate exchange offer of senior notes due for its outstanding  principal amount of senior subordinated debentures that mature on december  the offer of senior notes expired in late june  and the company accepted for exchange  of and senior notes into an equal principal amount of new senior notes 
the offer of senior notes expired in late july  and the company accepted for exchange  of debentures into an equal principal amount of new senior notes 
as noted above  the company plans to refinance the balance of the debentures with the proceeds of a new series of senior notes 
the balance of the and senior notes were repaid on july  with the proceeds of a one year  secured bridge loan to scl from a syndicate of banks 
the primary security for this loan was the shares in company subsidiaries whose assets were at the time designated to be sold and the shares in oeh owned by the company 
in december  this loan was amended as a revolving credit loan facility in the amount of  of which  was borrowed at december  later in july  scl completed the sale of its isle of man steam packet ferry business in the irish sea steam packet 
at a cash sale price of approximately  resulting in a gain on sale of approximately  part of the sale proceeds was used to repay  of outstanding debt of steam packet and  to repay part of the bridge loan referred to in the preceding paragraph used to retire and senior notes of the company on july in november  scl refinanced the main loan facility of its silja subsidiary as well as scl borrowings used to fund in part its silja investments since silja entered into a   term loan and revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks guaranteed by the company  and the company entered into a related   loan facility with the same syndicate 
the primary security for both facilities are mortgages on certain of silja s ships with the company loan subordinated to the silja loan 
proceeds in excess of those needed to refinance existing loans amounting to about  were available for scl s general corporate purposes 
the exchange offers for and senior notes and senior subordinated debentures  the sale of steam packet and repayment of the balance of the and senior notes with the sale proceeds  and the refinancing of silja  all as described above  were part of scl s planned restructuring of certain debt as outlined under the heading proposed restructuring of debt in item management s discussion and analysis in amendment no 
of the company s form k annual report 
the next steps of this plan include extension of the maturity of scl s  revolving credit facility from a bank syndicate secured by container equipment coming due in october  the refinancing of the remaining senior subordinated debentures and perhaps other debt with the net proceeds of the issue and sale of new senior unsecured notes of the company referred to above  the sale of additional newly issued class a common shares of the company  and the sale of oeh common shares owned by scl 
sales of senior notes and company and oeh shares will depend on market conditions 
management believes that the foregoing planned transactions as well as cash available from operations  other financings and other readily saleable assets of scl will be sufficient to service scl s and later obligations for the foreseeable future 
gner s passenger rail franchise comes up for renewal in april on january   the sra announced it would invite bids from all interested persons to operate the franchise for a new term of seven to ten years after it expires  and gner plans to bid to renew the franchise 
however  there can be no assurance that gner will be awarded the franchise or that the currently pending dispute with the sra may not affect its willingness to continue gner as the franchisee see note b 
failure to renew or extend the franchise in could require scl to terminate its rail operations  unless scl is awarded another passenger franchise  and could adversely affect scl s future earnings 
contractual obligations summary the following table summarizes scl s known material contractual obligations  excluding accounts payable and accrued liabilities  in and later years as of december  the data are derived from notes assets under capital lease  working capital facilities  long term debt  senior notes and subordinated debentures  a redeemable preferred shares and commitments and contingencies to the financial statements dollars in thousands year ended december  thereafter total working capital facilities   long term debt      senior notes     senior subordinated debentures   capital leases    redeemable preferred shares   operating leases     purchase commitments   the long term debt amount includes  due under bank syndicated loan facilities that scl expects to extend or refinance during the year including the  container revolving credit facility referred to above 
scl plans a public offering in of new senior notes to refinance these debentures as noted above 
operating lease payments include a total of  in and relating to gner rental payments in respect of rolling stock and access charges for railway infrastructure 
these commitments are payable only while gner holds the passenger rail franchise which currently expires in april off balance sheet arrangements scl has no material off balance sheet arrangements at december  other than those involving its equity investees reported in notes b  and  and commitments and contingencies and derivative financial instruments reported in notes and certain financial requirements scl is party to material credit financing agreements described in notes and to the financial statements which impose certain financial requirements 
one is the  revolving credit facility secured by container equipment with a group of banks referred to above 
this facility imposes financial covenants on scl  including i a requirement to maintain a minimum consolidated tangible net worth including preferred shares  ii a requirement not to exceed a specified leverage ratio  iii requirements to maintain a minimum debt service coverage ratio and minimum interest coverage ratios  iv a requirement that scl not suffer losses in any two consecutive years  and v limitations on the payment of dividends  redemption of capital stock or subordinated indebtedness  and investments in third parties  which limitations are calculated by reference to the sum of a base amount  one half of cumulative net earnings from  and the net proceeds from certain capital stock offerings  less the cumulative amounts of certain restricted payments and repurchases of preferred shares and subordinated debt  and less certain investments in unrelated parties 
the  principal amount of unsecured senior subordinated debentures due referred to above including  of unamortized discount and the  principal amount of unsecured senior notes due contain covenants restricting i the incurrence by scl of indebtedness unless scl meets a minimum cash flow coverage ratio  as defined  ii the payment of dividends  redemption of capital stock or subordinated indebtedness  and investments in third parties which restriction is similar to the equivalent one in the container facility described above  iii transactions between scl and its affiliates unless they are on arm s length terms  iv limitations on the ability of certain material subsidiaries of the company to restrict payments to the company  v the disposition of proceeds of asset sales by scl  vi any lines of business that are not similar or related to scl s existing businesses  and vii the ability of scl to amalgamate  consolidate or merge with or into another entity or to dispose of its assets substantially as an entirety 
if scl fails to maintain a specified amount of consolidated tangible net worth  or if a change of control of scl occurs  the company is obligated to make an offer to purchase of the debentures or notes at par in the case of the net worth test and of the debentures or notes at of the principal amount in the case of a change of control 
the  principal amount of senior notes due   principal amount of senior notes due and  principal amount senior notes due all unsecured obligations and including  of unamortized discount on the notes contain restrictive covenants substantially the same as those in the debentures and notes described above 
in addition  the notes contain covenants restricting i incurrence by scl of liens on its assets or property unless the notes are secured equally  subject to certain exceptions  and ii sale and leaseback transactions by scl  subject also to certain exceptions 
a consolidated subsidiary of the company has a  container securitization facility 
under it  the subsidiary  a bankruptcy remote company formed to facilitate asset securitization  issued a senior note and the company issued an effectively subordinated note 
the senior note in the principal amount of  is non recourse to the company and is amortizing using the subsidiary s net cash flow 
upon a change of control of the company  the senior note would come due 
the subordinated note in the principal amount of  began its five year amortization period in october the subordinated note requires that scl i not exceed a specified leverage ratio  ii maintain a minimum consolidated tangible net worth  and iii maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio 
the overall interest rate of this facility is approximately to over libor 
at december    was outstanding under this facility which is included in the debt obligations of scl on its consolidated balance sheet  and no further amount could be borrowed 
scl has no present plan to enter into a container securitization facility in the future 
as noted above  in november  silja entered into a   term loan and revolving credit facility agreement with a syndicate of banks guaranteed by the company  and the company entered into a related   loan facility agreement with the same syndicate 
the non revolving credit portion of the silja loan is repayable in installments with interest on both portions at euribor plus pa and a final maturity in october the company loan is also repayable in installments with interest at euribor plus pa maturing in october the silja loan requires silja on a consolidated basis with its subsidiaries i to maintain a minimum net book value and minimum debt service coverage ratio both as defined and ii to maintain minimum seasonal liquidity levels 
the company loan requires scl i to maintain a minimum consolidated tangible net worth as defined  ii not to exceed a specified leverage ratio and ii to meet certain cash maintenance requirements 
at december   the company and its subsidiaries were in full compliance with all of the foregoing credit financing agreements as well as less material ones to which they are party 
although management believes that scl s current operating plans will not be restricted by the various financial covenants described above  changes in economic or business conditions  results of operations or other factors may in the future result in circumstances in which the covenants restrict scl s plans or business operations 
leverage  foreign currency fluctuations at december   scl s consolidated long term indebtedness was   and its consolidated shareholders equity totalled   including redeemable preferred shares amounting to  
the terms of scl s indebtedness described above permit scl to incur substantial additional indebtedness from time to time 
the degree to which scl is leveraged may affect its ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  product and service development and general corporate purposes  to utilize cash flow from operations for purposes other than debt service  and to overcome seasonal or cyclical variations in its business 
the ability of scl to satisfy its obligations and to reduce its debt is dependent upon the future performance of scl  which will be subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors  including factors beyond the control of scl 
the acquisition by scl of new assets and properties  both for growth as well as for replacement  is capital intensive 
the availability of new capital to finance these expenditures depends on prevailing market conditions and the acceptability of financing terms offered to scl 
management believes that capital expected to be available to scl under various lines of credit  financing agreements  equity offerings and other sources  and from dispositions of existing assets and properties  as well as cash generated from operations  should be sufficient to meet scl s capital requirements in and for the foreseeable future 
no assurance  however  can be given that financing will continue to be available  or available on acceptable terms 
approximately of scl s consolidated long term indebtedness at december  accrued interest at rates that fluctuate with prevailing interest rates and  accordingly  increases in such rates may increase scl s interest payment obligations 
at december   scl had entered into interest rate swaps with financial institutions in order to manage its floating interest rate exposure  thereby reducing the proportion of fluctuating interest rate indebtedness to 
see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  and note to the financial statements 
substantial portions of scl s revenues and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies  especially the british pound sterling and the european euro 
a large part of scl s rail and ferry businesses operates in and around great britain and certain corporate costs and selling  general and administrative expenses of scl relate to its london offices 
fluctuations in the values of these currencies in us dollar terms may affect scl s financial condition and results of operations 
the impact of these fluctuations is mitigated to the extent that scl has both revenue and expenses denominated in the same currencies 
if revenue and expense items become imbalanced  scl may enter into forward foreign exchange contracts from time to time in order to hedge the imbalance

net finance costs decreased by  and the tax charge by  critical accounting policies and estimates this discussion of scl s financial condition and results of operations is based on its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of those financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are those that reflect significant judgments or uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
management believes the following are scl s most critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition scl s revenues are primarily derived from its four main business segments ferry operations  rail operations  container operations and leisure operations 
generally  revenues are recognized when the services have been rendered 
the following is a description of the composition of revenues of scl ferry and rail revenues are recognized when the transportation is provided rather than when a ticket is sold 
the amount of ticket sales not yet recognized as revenue is reflected as a liability in the consolidated balance sheet 
periodic evaluations are performed of this estimated liability and any adjustments are included in results of operations for the periods in which the evaluations are completed 
container revenues consist of earnings from containers under operating leases and sales type leases 
revenues from operating leases are recognized on a straight line basis over the respective lease period 
with respect to sales type leases  a gain or loss is calculated in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for leases and is included in revenue 
leisure revenues consist of earnings from oeh 
oeh revenue is recognized when rooms are occupied  services have been rendered or upon commencement of tourist train and cruise journeys 
oeh management fees represent fees earned under long term management contracts 
base fee revenues are recognized when earned in accordance with the terms of the contract 
commencing in the fourth quarter of  scl s economic interest in oeh fell below 
as a result  leisure revenues are principally accounted for under the equity method of accounting for investments 
see note to the financial statements 
carrying values of long lived assets and goodwill management periodically evaluates the recoverability of long lived assets  including containers  ships  property and finite lived intangible assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
these evaluations include analyses based on the cash flows generated by the underlying assets  profitability information including estimated future operating results  trends or other determinants of fair value 
if the value of the asset determined by these evaluations is less than its carrying amount  a loss is recognized for the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the asset 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of the related business may indicate an inability to recover the carrying value of the assets  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill must be evaluated annually for impairment 
goodwill impairment testing under sfas no 
is performed in two steps  first  the determination of impairment based upon the fair value of a reporting unit as compared with its carrying value and  second  if there is an impairment  the measurement of the amount of impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
as of december  and  scl determined the carrying value of all its operating segments was less than their respective derived fair values  indicating that there was no impairment of the recorded goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
to determine fair value  scl relied on valuation models utilizing discounted cash flows 
depreciation containers and ships are recorded at cost and  after allowance for salvage value  are depreciated over their estimated useful lives by the straight line method 
the estimated useful lives and salvage values for containers are generally years and  respectively  and for ships generally to years and to  respectively 
real estate and other fixed assets are recorded at cost and are depreciated over their estimated useful lives by the straight line method 
the depreciation rates on freehold buildings range from to years and on machinery and other remaining assets from to years 
leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life or the respective lease terms 
pensions scl s pension plans are accounted for using actuarial valuations required by sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  and sfas no 
 employers accounting for post retirement benefits other than pensions 
scl s minimum pension liability  net of tax was approximately  as of december  management considers accounting for retirement plans critical to all of scl s operating segments because management is required to make significant subjective judgments about a number of actuarial assumptions  which include discount rates  health care cost trends and rates  salary growth  long term return on plan assets and mortality rates 
management believes that a long term return on plan assets in is reasonable despite the recent market volatility in which scl s plan assets had investment returns of approximately for the year ended december  and investment losses of approximately for the year ended december  in determining the expected long term rate of return on assets  management has evaluated input from scl s actuaries and financial advisors  including their review of anticipated future long term performance of individual asset classes and the consideration of the appropriate asset allocation strategy given the anticipated requirements of the respective plans to determine the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested 
the projected returns by these consultants are based on broad equity and bond indices  including fixed interest rate gilts of long term duration since the plans are predominantly in the uk scl s expected long term rate of return is based on a planned asset allocation of in equity investments  with an expected long term rate of return of  and in fixed income investments  with an expected long term rate of return of 
scl s actual asset allocation as of december  was in line with planned allocations 
management regularly reviews scl s actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances investments to targeted allocations when considered appropriate 
while the analysis gives appropriate consideration to recent fund performance and historical returns  the assumption is primarily a long term  prospective rate 
management will continue to evaluate the expected rate of return at least annually  and will adjust as necessary 
depending on the assumptions and estimates used  pension expense could vary within a range of outcomes and have a material effect on scl s consolidated financial statements 
lowering the expected long term rate of return on scl s pension plans by from to would have increased pension expense for by approximately  management is currently monitoring and evaluating the level of pension contributions based on various factors that include  but are not limited to  investment performance  actuarial valuation and tax deductibility 
management will evaluate the need for additional contributions in based on these factors 
management believes that the cash flows from scl s operations will be sufficient to fund additional contributions  if any  to the plans 
see note to the financial statements 
deferred maintenance costs scl s vessels and train rolling stock are required to incur major repairs and maintenance which cannot be performed while the assets are operating 
scl capitalizes the costs associated with the major repairs and maintenance and amortizes these costs on a straight line basis over a two year period 
management believes that these criteria are consistent with industry practice and that scl s policy of capitalization reflects the economics and market values of the related assets 
tax assets scl maintains a valuation allowance to reduce its gross deferred tax assets to reflect the amount  based upon scl s estimates of income  that would likely be realized 
if scl s future operations differed from those in the estimates  scl may need to increase or decrease the valuation allowance  which could affect its reported operations 
contingencies scl is subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business 
scl considers the likelihood of a loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability as well as its ability reasonably to estimate the amount of loss in determining loss contingencies 
an estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
management regularly evaluates current available information to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted

recent accounting pronouncements scl s adoption of recent accounting pronouncements is described in note t to the financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosuresabout market risk as noted under leverage  foreign currency fluctuations in item management s discussion and analysis above  scl is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  as well as fuel price movements 
these exposures are monitored and managed by scl as part of its overall risk management program which recognizes the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to mitigate potentially material adverse effects on scl s consolidated earnings and cash flow 
as part of this management  scl enters into interest rate and foreign currency swap contracts  foreign currency forward exchange contracts and fuel price hedge agreements from time to time 
see note to the financial statements item below 
scl does not use market risk sensitive financial instruments for trading purposes 
the following discussion includes sensitivity analyses for hypothetical changes in the interest rates  exchange rates or fuel commodity prices that scl is exposed to 
in all cases  the hypothetical change was calculated based on a parallel shift in the forward price curve existing at december  the forward curve takes into account the time value of money and the future expectations regarding the value of the underlying interest rate  currency and commodity 
the market risk relating to interest rates arises mainly from scl s financing activities 
scl s earnings are affected by changes in interest rates on borrowings  principally based on us dollar libor and euribor  and on short term cash investments 
management assesses scl s market risk based on changes in interest rates utilizing a sensitivity analysis 
if interest rates increased by  with all other variables held constant  scl s annual net finance costs  as reported on its statements of consolidated operations  would have increased by approximately  based on its variable rate borrowings and interest rate swap agreements outstanding at december  
changes in interest rates also impact the fair value of scl s fixed rate debt 
if interest rates increased by  with all other variables held constant  the fair value of scl s fixed rate debt would have decreased by approximately  based on amounts outstanding at december  
the market risk relating to foreign currencies arises from buying  selling and financing in currencies other than the us dollar  principally uk sterling and euros 
management anticipates this foreign currency exchange rate risk will remain a market exposure for the foreseeable future 
certain non us subsidiaries of the company borrow in local foreign currencies  and scl may enter into forward exchange contracts relating to purchases denominated in foreign currencies in order to manage and mitigate exchange rate risk 
scl had no currency swap agreement in place at december  management uses a sensitivity analysis to assess the changes in the values of the us dollar on foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities 
the primary assumption used in these models is a hypothetical weakening or strengthening of the us dollar against scl s currency exposure at december  as a result of this analysis  management determined that the impact on monetary assets and liabilities of a change in foreign currency exchange rates in relation to the us dollar would amount to approximately  scl is also exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices  as an increase in the price of fuel would result in lower earnings and increased cash outflows 
management enters into fuel swap contracts from time to time to procure a portion of scl s fuel requirements and to hedge its exposure to volatility in fuel market prices 
these swaps at december  were designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes and matured during see note management uses a sensitivity analysis to assess the changes in fuel prices 
the primary assumption used in this model is a hypothetical increase in the price of fuel at december  as a result of this analysis  management determined that the impact on operations and cash flows of a hypothetical increase in fuel prices would not be material to the operations and cash flows of scl
