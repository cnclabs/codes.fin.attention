executive overview we provide a broad array of solutions worldwide that enable pharmaceutical and other life science companies to strategically optimize their sales and marketing channels and clinical resources 
our strategy is to continue to diversify and expand our solutions portfolio  customer base and geographic reach by leveraging our extensive knowledge of the pharmaceutical and life sciences industries and capitalizing upon our deep relationships in these industries 
we have and will continue to rely on both internal growth and acquisitions to meet to our growth objectives 
our acquisition of synavant in and its subsequent integration into our business is an important milestone in our history 
this acquisition diversifies and expands our solutions portfolio  particularly as it relates to the pharmaceutical marketing channel  by adding interactive marketing services in the us and abroad  as well as new data and services solutions in europe 
additionally  our sales force effectiveness capabilities have extended beyond clients using dendrite s sales force effectiveness software solutions to those using software products of our competitors 
this expansion outside of supporting only our own software users has provided us the opportunity to gain an additional recurring revenue base with several key global pharmaceutical companies 
finally  this acquisition diversifies and expands our geographic reach  particularly in europe  and enables us to capitalize on economies of scale within certain geographic markets 
as we enter  we have more solutions and a broader customer base than ever before and we believe that this combination presents significant opportunity for future growth 
however  as we seek to expand our business  we face competition not only from other companies  but also from solutions developed internally by our clients 
as a result  we plan to increase our investments in marketing and sales resources and programs in fiscal to help us better sell in this challenging climate 
our future growth will be dependent on our ability to further penetrate the markets in which we operate and increase the adoption rate of our expanded portfolio of solutions 
we evaluate our performance based upon a number of operating metrics 
chief among these are revenues  services gross margin percent  operating margins  earnings per diluted share  operating cash flow and days sales outstanding 
all of these items are addressed in detail throughout the md a 
fiscal was a significant year for us  as we saw the execution of our strategy yield strong growth in revenues  operating margin and earnings per share 
we also continued to exhibit strong cash generation attributes  improving days sales outstanding from the prior year and generating a strong positive operating cash flow  even as we paid off a significant amount of liabilities associated with the synavant acquisition 
critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates a critical accounting policy is one that is both very important to the portrayal of a company s financial position and results of operations and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
the company believes its critical accounting policies to be revenue recognition  acquisitions  impairments  income taxes and restructuring 
revenue recognition the area of revenue recognition requires the company s management to make significant judgments and estimates 
aicpa statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  governs revenue recognition for arrangements that include software which is more than incidental to the arrangement 
under sop  if a sale of software includes services that are essential to the functionality of the software  then the software and essential services are to be accounted for using contract accounting as described in accounting research bulletin  long term construction type contracts  and sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
the determination of whether or not services are essential to the functionality of the software can differ from arrangement to arrangement and requires the use of significant judgment by management 
factors used in determining whether or not services are essential to the functionality may include whether or not physical changes are being made to the software s underlying source code  the complexity of software configuration services  the level of effort required to build interfaces  the overall relationship of the service fees to the license fees  the length of time expected to complete the services  and whether or not the services can be obtained by a customer from their internal resources or another third party vendor 
if services are not considered to be essential to the functionality of the software  sop generally allows companies to recognize revenue for software licenses upon delivery of the licenses  prior to configuration or implementation services  provided that the other requirements of the sop are met 
in management s judgment  the company s configuration and implementation services generally are essential to the functionality of its software 
therefore  the company typically recognizes revenues using the percentage of completion method as detailed in sop many of the company s arrangements include multiple deliverables 
in the absence of higher level specific authoritative guidance  the company determines the units of accounting for multiple element arrangements in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
specifically  the company will consider a delivered item as a separate unit of accounting if it has value to the customer on a stand alone basis  if there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered elements  and if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered element  if delivery or performance of the undelivered element is considered probable and is substantially within the company s control 
the determination of whether or not arrangements meet these criteria requires significant judgment on the part of the company s management 
if the company s arrangements did not meet the separation criteria of eitf  the timing of revenue recognition could be delayed 
the percentage of completion method of revenue recognition requires management to use significant estimates in measuring the progress to completion for each project 
for its license fee and implementation service projects  the company uses the input measure of labor incurred as compared with total expected labor for the entire project 
the determination of total project labor requires the use of significant judgment and estimates 
we review these estimates on a monthly basis 
actual results could differ from these estimates  which would impact the amount of revenue previously recognized  had better estimates been available at the time 
accounting for acquisitions and related accruals the accounting related to purchase combinations carried out by the company requires management to estimate the fair value and useful life of the assets acquired and the fair value of the liabilities assumed in the combinations 
these estimates of fair value are based on our business plan for the entities acquired including planned redundancies  restructuring  use of assets acquired and assumptions as to the ultimate resolution of obligations assumed for which no future benefit will be received 
we also utilize appraisal reports issued by third party appraisers 
should actual use of assets or resolution of obligations differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated fair values  useful lives  or both  would be required 
during  in connection with the purchase accounting related to the sai acquisition  the company established an accrual related to costs which would be incurred in connection with exiting sai s headquarters facility 
during  in connection with the purchase accounting related to the synavant acquisition  the company established certain accruals related to costs that we expect will be incurred in connection with exiting multiple former synavant facilities and eliminating certain former synavant positions 
these accruals were based on estimates made at the time of acquisition 
the liability accrued for expenses to be incurred in exiting certain synavant facilities includes assumptions related to sublease income which offsets future lease obligations 
the underlying subleases are not in place for all facilities and the future placement of subleases  including the timing and terms and conditions of subleases  could be different than our assumptions 
accounting for impairments we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset might not be recoverable 
if indicators of impairment are present  we evaluate the recoverability of the long lived assets  other than goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles  by estimating future undiscounted cash flows that are directly associated with and expected to arise as a direct result of the use and eventual disposition of the long lived asset 
if this estimate of future undiscounted cash flows demonstrates that recoverability is not probable  an impairment loss would be calculated and recognized based on the excess carrying value of the long lived asset over the long lived asset s fair value 
the estimate of the fair value and the future undiscounted cash flows of the underlying long lived assets are based on significant judgments and assumptions 
we review capitalized software development costs and purchased capitalized software development costs for impairment at each balance sheet date to determine if the unamortized capitalized costs of a computer software product is greater than the net realizable value of that product 
in instances where the unamortized capitalized costs are greater than the net realizable value  we will record an impairment loss 
we assess the impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles on an annual basis as of october of each year  and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
some factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in our use of acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
on an annual basis  or when we determine that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we calculate and compare the fair value of our reporting unit to its carrying value 
we currently have only one reporting unit 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value  we calculate the implied fair value of the goodwill for our reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value of the goodwill for our reporting unit 
if the implied fair value of the goodwill were less than the carrying value of the goodwill  we would recognize in our consolidated statement of operations an impairment loss equal to such difference  not to exceed the carrying value 
on an annual basis  or when we determine that the carrying value of an indefinite lived intangible asset may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we calculate and compare the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset to its carrying value 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value  an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to the difference 
if we deem the useful life to be no longer indefinite  after testing for impairment in accordance with the applicable rules stated above  we would amortize the intangible asset over its remaining estimated useful life  following the pattern in which the expected benefits will be consumed or otherwise used up as well as continue to review for impairment in the future on an annual basis 
accounting for income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates that are expected to be in effect when the differences reverse 
the company regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability and establishes a valuation allowance based on historical taxable income  projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences  all of which require significant management judgments 
management must believe it is more likely than not that the recorded net deferred tax asset will be realized 
realization is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income of a specific nature prior to the expiration of the loss carryforwards  capital loss and foreign tax credit carryforwards 
the asset may be reduced if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced 
accounting for restructuring during  the company recognized costs in connection with a restructuring plan which involved a reduction in the size of the company s work force  downsizing of certain facilities and relocation of certain activities 
the restructuring related costs were based upon formal plans approved by the company s management using the information available at the time 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the restructuring and related charges 
mergers and acquisitions we regularly evaluate opportunities to acquire products or businesses that represent strategic enhancements to our operations 
such acquisition opportunities  if they arise  may involve the use of cash or equity instruments 
the company has made the following acquisitions over the last three years synavant inc as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  on june   we completed our acquisition of synavant 
synavant provided a broad range of knowledge based services to pharmaceutical and other life science companies around the world 
its global solutions included pharmaceutical crm applications  interactive marketing  server and database management  dedicated local help line support  training  telemarketing  sample management and product recall services 
synavant was headquartered in atlanta  georgia  and had offices in countries 
we believe that combining synavant s resources with dendrite s resources creates a more comprehensive information  software and services company dedicated to the global life sciences industry  and further enhances our ability to provide market leading solutions to the sales  marketing and clinical functions of pharmaceutical and other life science companies 
synavant s results of operations have been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition 
the aggregate purchase price for synavant was approximately  including consideration paid for the common stock per share and approximately  of legal and professional fees incurred in connection with the transaction 
the third party valuation of certain intangible assets was finalized during the fourth quarter of when we also finalized our restructuring plan to eliminate certain former synavant positions and exit certain former synavant facilities due to redundancies and gained efficiencies 
in connection with the acquisition  we exited certain former synavant facilities and eliminated certain former synavant positions 
we accrued approximately  at june   for liabilities associated with the cost of completing the restructuring plan 
the components of this accrued liability were approximately  of severance costs for former synavant positions being eliminated and approximately  of costs to exit former synavant facilities 
during the fourth quarter of  we reduced the liabilities related to the restructuring plan by approximately  based on management s revised estimate of the total cost 
the components of the reduction to the accrued liability were approximately  for lower expected severance costs for former synavant positions being eliminated and approximately  for lower costs to exit certain former synavant facilities 
this reduction was recorded by an adjustment within goodwill in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
we believe the accrued liability as of december  will be adequate to cover the costs which will be incurred related to the restructuring 
the liability accrued for expenses incurred in exiting certain synavant facilities includes assumptions related to sublease income which offsets future lease obligations 
the underlying subleases are not in place for all facilities and the future placement of subleases  including the timing and terms and conditions of subleases  could be different than the assumptions and impact future results of operations 
software associates international on september   the company acquired software associates international sai  a privately held company based in new jersey 
sai provided software products and solutions that enabled corporate level sales and marketing analysis for pharmaceutical companies 
these solutions are complementary to the company s core suite of business products 
the results of sai s operations have been included in the consolidated financial statements since the acquisition date 
the aggregate purchase price for sai was approximately  which consisted of cash of approximately  accrued professional service fees of approximately  and options to purchase dendrite common stock valued at approximately  the fair value of the stock options was estimated using the black scholes valuation model 
the company finalized a third party valuation of certain intangible assets and its evaluation of acquired facilities and personnel for redundancy 
the company recorded  of goodwill and  of acquired intangible assets  of which approximately  was assigned to registered trademarks that are not subject to amortization 
the remaining  of acquired intangible assets includes purchased software development costs of approximately  approximately  of non compete agreements and approximately  of customer relationship assets 
in connection with the acquisition of sai  the company developed an exit plan 
the exit plan consisted of closing a facility in mt 
arlington  new jersey  and relocating the operations to the company s other facilities in new jersey 
the company accrued as part of the acquisition costs the costs to terminate certain leases amounting to  the company closed the facility during the first quarter of pharma vision on august   the company acquired pharma vision for cash consideration of approximately  including approximately  of professional service fees 
pharma vision collected and sold data for customer targeting that pharmaceutical representatives use in europe and provided support to pharmaceutical customers in belgium and the netherlands 
the results of pharma vision s operations have been included in the consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition 
results of operations the following table sets forth our results of operations expressed as a percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated year ended december revenues license fees services costs of revenues cost of license fees purchased software impairment cost of services gross margin operating expenses selling  general and administrative research and development restructuring charge asset impairments total operating expenses operating income loss interest and other income income loss before income taxes income tax benefit expense net income loss non gaap we use non gaap adjusted amounts internally in reviewing and evaluating our historic period over period operating performance as well as our combined business performance  and also use such information in managing the overall business 
all such non gaap information is supplemental to information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap and is not intended to represent a presentation in accordance with gaap and should not be considered as a substitute for  or superior to  measures of performance prepared and presented in accordance with gaap 
the following discussion of our results of operations includes the results of synavant for the period from the june  acquisition date 
the following discussion of our results of operations also  where indicated  segregates and reconciles the results of synavant to total company results 
we believe that segregating synavant s results from the date of acquisition provides investors with useful information  on a comparative basis  on the impact of synavant on overall company operations for the year ended december  we also believe that information concerning synavant s contribution to revenues provides investors additional information concerning dendrite s historical business performance 
year ended december  and revenues 
total revenues increased to  for the year ended december   up  or  from  for the year ended december  approximately of the total revenues for the year ended december  were recognized from synavant 
excluding the revenues recognized from synavant  revenues increased approximately  for the year ended december  over the corresponding prior year period 
synavant s revenue contribution in is not expected to be as significant as the annualized contribution in due to customer cancellations that were known at the time of the acquisition and a large one time rollout in the third and fourth quarters of license fee revenues decreased to  for the year ended december   down  or  from  for the year ended december  this decrease is primarily related to sales to new clients as well as purchases of additional user licenses by existing customers who increased the sizes of their sales forces during the third and fourth quarters of license fees are  by nature  non recurring items and fluctuate from year to year 
service revenues increased to  for the year ended december   up  or  from  for the year ended december  approximately of the service revenues for the year ended december  were recognized from synavant  of which approximately was attributable to pass through postage of the interactive marketing business 
excluding the results of synavant  service revenues increased  for the year ended december  over the corresponding prior year period 
this increase was primarily driven by the company s growth of approximately in our domestic technical services  in our domestic sales support services  in our international services as well as our data and consulting business more than doubling during the year  offset in part by a decrease in low gross margin revenue 
cost of revenues 
total cost of revenues increased to  for the year ended december   an increase of  or  from  for the year ended december  the primary drivers of the increase in cost of revenues were attributable to our recent acquisitions 
cost of license fees increased to  for the year ended december   an increase of  or  from  for the year ended december  cost of license fees for the year ended december  is comprised of the amortization of capitalized software development costs and purchased software costs of  and  respectively  and third party vendor license fees of  cost of license fees for the same period in is comprised of the amortization of capitalized software development costs and purchased software costs of  and  respectively  and third party vendor license fees of  the increase in amortization of purchased software costs relate primarily to a full year s amortization of the assets obtained from the sai acquisition 
cost of services increased to  for the year ended december   up  or  from  for the year ended december  the increase in cost of services is primarily a result of the additional costs due to the increase in headcount and associated costs from the synavant and sai acquisitions as well as pass through postage expenses of approximately  from the synavant acquisition 
these increases are offset  in part  by decreases in dendrite s traditional low gross margin revenue and efficiencies gained from cost reduction actions in the third quarter of gross margin 
total gross margin for the year ended december  and was and  respectively 
gross margin for license fees was for the year ended december   down from for the year ended december  the decrease in gross margin was primarily impacted by increased amortization of purchased software costs relating to the assets obtained from the sai acquisition  as well as lower license fee revenues 
gross margin for services was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this decrease in gross margin for services is attributable to the inclusion of certain synavant lower margin business  including approximately  of pass through postage 
these decreases are offset  in part  by a decrease in dendrite s traditional low gross margin revenue and the efficiencies gained from dendrite s cost reduction actions in the third quarter of selling  general and administrative sg a expenses 
sg a expenses increased to  for the year ended december   up  or  from  for the year ended december  this increase reflects the additional operating costs from the synavant and sai acquisitions and amortization expense related to the synavant and sai acquisitions  partially offset by the impact of the company s third quarter cost reduction measures 
as a percentage of revenues  sg a increased slightly to of revenues for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  while we expect to realize a reduction in sg a costs due to integration synergies and other cost saving initiatives executed in the second half of  we also plan to use most of these savings to fund future investments in sales and marketing initiatives directed at selling our expanded product offerings 
research and development r d expenses 
r d expenses increased to  for the year ended december   up  or  from  for the year ended december  the increase in r d expenses relates to higher employment costs due to the increase in headcount from the sai acquisition 
as a percentage of revenues  r d expenses decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  asset impairment 
during the year ended december   we reviewed the carrying value of our long lived assets including the facility held for sale 
based upon a third party valuation  the carrying value of the facility held for sale was adjusted to  which approximated its fair value less costs to sell 
the resulting  impairment loss was recorded as a separate line item in the consolidated statement of operations 
other income expense 
other income expense increased to  for the year ended december   up  from  in this increase was primarily attributable to payments made to the company in settlement of certain litigation to which we were a party 
provision for income taxes 
the annual estimated effective tax expense rate recorded for the year ended december  was approximately  compared to for the year ended december  in connection with the synavant integration  the company determined which foreign entities would be dissolved and performed a reforecast of projected taxable income by jurisdiction and recognized a full valuation allowance on a net operating loss carry forward for one of its foreign subsidiaries of approximately  which increased the effective tax expense rate by 
years ended december  and revenues 
total revenues decreased to  for the year ended december   down  or  from  for the year ended december  license fee revenues decreased to  for the year ended december   down  or  from  for the year ended december  license fees are  by nature  non recurring items and fluctuate from year to year 
the majority of license fee revenue recognized during the year ended december  related to sales to new clients as well as purchases of additional user licenses by existing customers who increased the size of their sales forces 
the decrease in license fee revenues from to was primarily due to fewer software upgrades by existing customers in as compared to license fee revenues increased during the fourth quarter of by from the fourth quarter of and during the third quarter of from the third quarter of these increases were caused by additional license purchases by a large existing customer as well as a sale to a new customer 
service revenues increased to  for the year ended december   up  or  from  for the year ended december  service revenues as a percentage of total revenues were in as compared to in the company s results reflected growth in technical and hardware support services and international operations offset by a decrease in its domestic sales support services of approximately compared to the decrease in domestic sales support services was primarily attributable to the roll off of a large customer 
service revenues were atypically high in the fourth quarter of this was a result of our largest customer completing a major rollout for their entire user base during the fourth quarter of the rollout resulted in significant increases in the services rendered to our customers for initial training and peak period hardware and help desk support 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues decreased to  for the year ended december  down  or  from  for the year ended december  cost of license fees decreased to  for the year ended december   down  or  from  for the year ended december  cost of license fees for the year ended december  is comprised of the amortization of capitalized software development costs and purchased software costs of  and  respectively  and third party vendor license fees of  cost of license fees for the year ended december  is comprised of the amortization of capitalized software development costs and purchased software costs of  and  respectively  and third party vendor license fees of  the decrease in the amortization of capitalized software development costs in the year ended december  was primarily attributable to the company entering into a new product strategy in which resulted in accelerated amortization of the remaining purchased capitalized software by the end of the new strategy called for the features and functionality of the marketing management international  inc mmi products to be incorporated under the current webforce umbrella 
the company estimated the net realizable value of the mmi product to be greater than our carrying value in accordance with statement of financial accounting  standard no  accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed sfas  however  due to the new version of webforce which was to replace the mmi product  the estimated useful life of the mmi capitalized software was reduced to approximately six months 
as a result  we accelerated the amortization to coincide with the estimated useful life of the product and recorded an additional  of amortization expense 
the remaining decrease in amortization relates to amortization recorded in on purchased capitalized software costs from the company s acquisition of analytika and associated business computing  n 
v abc 
these were fully written off in the second quarter of and therefore there was no amortization expense in the increase in the third party vendor license fees is directly related to the increase in sales of third party licenses during the fourth quarter of during the second quarter of  the company recorded an impairment charge of  related to its purchased capitalized software costs from its acquisitions of analytika and abc 
as discussed above  the company entered into a new product strategy in this new strategy called for the retirement of the abc and analytika products since features and functionality were not being incorporated under the new webforce umbrella 
at that time  we determined that we would no longer offer the analytika and abc products  but would continue to support both products until existing customer contract terms expired 
as a result  no revenues were forecasted for either product in the future other than those under existing contracts 
further  despite the lack of future revenue  we needed to maintain the infrastructure required to support our analytika and abc products for the term of each contract 
since the forecasted revenue base was significantly reduced yet the infrastructure and administrative costs remained relatively fixed  these operations transitioned from positive to negative cash flows 
in accordance with sfas we compared the unamortized capitalized software developments costs to the net realizable value of that product 
in our analysis  the net realizable value for the analytika and abc products was determined to be negative due to the fact that estimated future revenues generated from new sales were zero 
as a result all of the purchased capitalized software associated with analytika and abc was determined to be impaired during the quarter ended june  see note to the consolidated financial statements and restructuring charge and asset impairment below for a discussion of the restructuring charges and asset impairments recorded in the year ended december  cost of services decreased to  for the year ended december   down  or  from  in this decrease was due primarily to efficiencies gained from the company s restructuring plan which resulted in the relocation of certain services to locations with lower operating expenses 
in addition  there were costs incurred in which did not reoccur in in we incurred  which related to other exit costs  primarily retention bonuses 
these retention bonuses were paid to those employees who would lose their jobs at a future date as a result of the restructuring  discussed below under restructuring charge  but who were needed during the transition to complete assigned tasks related to the exit plan 
the decrease in cost of services was also due to  of costs recorded in the year ended december   relating to the recognition of future losses on select contracts for which we expected the costs of providing the future services would exceed the revenue to be received from the performance of the services 
we recognized these future losses on select contracts while examining the restructuring of our stroudsburg  pa facility 
subsequently  during  we reversed approximately  of the costs related to future loss contracts as the company s future obligations with respect to those contracts were favorably resolved 
gross margin 
total gross margin for the year ended december  and was and  respectively 
gross margin for license fees was for the year ended december   up from for the year ended december  the gross margin in was impacted significantly by the  asset impairment and  of accelerated amortization of mmi purchased capitalized software costs that were recorded in excluding these items  the gross margin would have been for as a result  gross margin from actually decreased from due primarily to the increase in the sale of third party licenses as a percentage of total license fee revenue 
gross margin for services was for the year ended december   up from for the year ended december  the gross margin in was impacted significantly by the  of costs described above within cost of services that was recorded in excluding these items  the gross margin would have been for the improvement in gross margin during the year ended december  was due to the reversal in the year ended december  of approximately  of costs previously recorded relating to the recognition of future losses on selected contracts  for which the company s future obligations with respect to these contracts were favorably resolved 
also contributing to the improvement was a favorable mix shift within our services business and the efficiencies gained from the company s restructuring plan and the relocation of certain services to locations with lower operating expenses that took place during we believe that in excluding the above described items in discussing gross margin  it provides investors with useful information  for comparative purposes  of the impact that these particular items had on overall gross margin on a period to period basis

sg a expenses decreased to  for the year ended december  down  or  from  for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenues  sg a expenses decreased to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  the decrease in sg a expenses for the year ended december  was partially attributed to approximately  of costs incurred during the year ended december  these costs consisted of the following a start up costs associated with the new facilities of approximately  which included payments of approximately  to outside consultants for services related to the reorganization of our business and  of duplicate employee service costs relating to employee overlap during the transition phase  b transfer of operations of approximately  which included costs that were required to be paid to certain customers for costs incurred by those customers as part of the relocation of some of our services  bonuses paid to employees for their assistance with the transition and transfer of operations  and the accrual of real estate commissions for a building held for sale  c duplicate facility costs of approximately  resulting from costs incurred to have both facilities operating simultaneously for a period of time during the transition ie  rent  utilities  real estate taxes  insurance  etc 
and d relocation and moving costs of approximately  excluding these costs  sg a expenses would have been  for the year ended december   which would have resulted in a decrease of  or for the year ended december  the remaining decrease was principally due to i  of costs associated with the company s crm launch in partnership with oracle corporation during the year ended december   ii a decrease in employment costs due to operating efficiencies and lower management bonuses in the year ended december   and iii the implementation of sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  which would have resulted in a reduction of goodwill amortization expenses of approximately  had the provisions been retroactively applied for the year ended december  these decreases were partially offset by approximately  of costs incurred during the year ended december  related to a reduction in the size of the workforce completed in the third quarter of research and development r d expenses

on june   the company announced a restructuring of its business operations to reflect a lower expected revenue growth model in the near term 
as a result  the company re examined its cost structure and determined that there were duplicate employee costs and excess overhead costs of approximately to million annually 
the restructuring plan consisted of a reduction of delivery and staff positions and the termination of independent contractors across various departments in the us and europe 
in addition additional positions were eliminated as part of the closing of the company s facility in stroudsburg  pa 
the stroudsburg  pa operations were relocated to other company facilities in new jersey  virginia and a new facility in bethlehem  pa 
the exit costs  consisting of costs to retrofit the stroudsburg facility  lease termination costs and the write off of leasehold improvements  were included in the restructuring charge while the moving and other start up costs were not included in this restructuring charge and were expensed as incurred 
during the second quarter of  the company recorded a charge of  associated with this restructuring 
this charge was reduced by  to  in the fourth quarter of as a result of management s revised estimate of the total costs of the restructuring 
this reduction of  was recorded within the restructuring charge on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
during the fourth quarter of  the company reduced the restructuring accrual by an additional  due to revised estimates of the total costs of the restructuring 
of the restructuring charge   related primarily to severance that had not been paid as of december  and  accordingly  is classified as accrued restructuring charge in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
the restructuring charges were based upon formal plans approved by the company s management using the information available at the time 
management of the company believes this provision will be adequate to cover the costs incurred relating to the restructuring 
the company anticipated that the accrued restructuring balance of  as of december  would be paid in the company paid this balance in  as anticipated 
the activity on the accrued restructuring charge balance for the year ended december  is summarized in the table below accrued restructuring as of january  cash payments in reversal of accrual in accrued restructuring as of december  termination payments to employees    facility exit costs   contract termination and other restructuring costs   asset impairment 
during the year ended december   the company reviewed the carrying value of its long lived assets including the facility held for sale 
based upon this review  the carrying value of the facility held for sale was adjusted 
the revised fair value less costs to sell  of approximately  was determined based upon a third party valuation 
the resulting  impairment loss has been recorded as a separate line item in the statement of operations for the year ended december  during the year ended december   the company reviewed the carrying values of its long lived assets  including its minority investments in start up ventures  identifiable intangibles and goodwill 
during the review of two start up ventures  the company became aware of a series of operating losses and the need of each start up venture to obtain additional financing to continue operations which became especially severe in the second quarter of in addition  prior to the end of both start up ventures filed for bankruptcy 
as a result  during the year ended december   the company wrote off  of cost method investments it had in these two start up ventures due to an other than temporary decline in the fair value of these investments 
as part of its partnership with oracle corporation  the company announced  on june   its intention to market an integrated crm solution to meet the specialized needs of the worldwide pharmaceutical industry 
as a result  the company s vision and product platform changed 
as discussed above  in cost of revenues  we determined that we would no longer offer the analytika and abc products  but would continue to support both products until existing customer contract terms expired 
as a result  no revenues were forecasted for either product for the future other than those under existing contracts 
in accordance with sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  we reviewed the future undiscounted net cash flows for our analytika and abc products and determined the cash flows to be negative due to the fact the projected revenue generated from new sales for each operation was zero 
as a result  all the goodwill associated with analytika and abc was impaired during the quarter ended june  accordingly  the company recorded an impairment charge of  of goodwill during the year ended december  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in connection with its second quarter restructuring  the company made the decision not to occupy a recently acquired facility and instead shifted its operations to other existing facilities 
the company therefore decided to sell the recently acquired facility 
an asset impairment of  was recorded to reduce the carrying value of its facility held for sale to its estimated fair market value including selling costs 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
interest income  net 
interest income  net  decreased to  for the year ended december   down  or  from  for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to lower short term interest rates in the year ended december  versus the year ended december  provision for income taxes 
the effective tax expense rate recorded for the year ended december  was  as compared with an effective tax benefit rate of for the year ended december  in july  the state of new jersey enacted new tax legislation that adversely impacts the effective state tax rate of most companies operating in new jersey 
this legislation was retroactive to january  the effect of this legislation increased the company s effective tax rate from to for the tax year 
the higher effective tax rate resulted in approximately  of additional income tax expense in the difference in rates also resulted from the net loss position and the write off of certain goodwill amounts which were not deductible for tax purposes  both of which occurred during quarterly results of operations the following table sets forth certain unaudited quarterly consolidated statement of operations data for and our quarterly results have varied considerably in the past and are likely to vary from quarter to quarter in the future

liquidity and capital resources at december   working capital was approximately  compared to  as of december  cash and investments were  as of december   compared to  as of december  this significant decrease is primarily attributable to the cash paid in connection with the synavant acquisition  partially offset by cash generated by operations 
we finance our business primarily through cash generated by operations 
net cash provided by operating activities was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was largely due to payments made in connection with the acquisition of synavant which were primarily reflected as reductions in accounts payable and accrued expenses as well as purchase accounting restructuring accruals 
this decrease was partially offset by incremental collections of accounts receivable also related to the synavant acquisition 
cash used in investing activities was  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  the increase of  was primarily attributable to the cash used for the synavant acquisition in excess of cash used for the sai acquisition 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in purchases of property and equipment of  during the year ended december   compared to the corresponding prior year 
the company anticipates an increase in its capital expenditures for the increase is primarily due to the capital requirements of the new corporate headquarters and the need to adjust going forward capital requirements for a larger combined company reflecting the acquisition of synavant 
the company currently expects that it will incur approximately million of additional capital expenditures to purchase fixtures and furniture  leasehold improvements and computer hardware  software and other equipment in connection with the headquarters relocation 
the company also expects capital spending in the range of approximately million to support the infrastructure associated with a full year of combined dendrite and synavant operations 
we review our capital expenditure program periodically and adjust it as required to meet current needs 
the foregoing amounts are based on current assumptions and are subject to change during the course of fiscal cash provided by financing activities was  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  the increase of  was primarily attributable to an increase in stock option exercises during the year ended december  due to the timing of the disbursements of cash for the synavant acquisition  the company borrowed and repaid  from its revolving line of credit during the year ended december  at no time during the year ended december  did the company have more than  outstanding under the line of credit 
the company regularly evaluates opportunities to acquire products or businesses complementary to our operations 
such acquisition opportunities  if they arise and are successfully completed  may involve the use of cash or equity instruments 
the company believes that available funds  anticipated cash flows from operations and the availability of our revolving line of credit will satisfy our current projected working capital and capital expenditure requirements  exclusive of cash required for possible future acquisitions of businesses  products and technologies  during the next twelve to eighteen months 
there can be no assurance  however  that our business will continue to generate cash flow at current levels or that anticipated operational improvements will be achieved 
our ability to generate future cash flows depends on our future performance and financial results  which  to a certain extent  are subject to general conditions in or effecting the pharmaceutical industry and to general economic  political  financial  competitive  legislative and regulatory factors beyond our control 
contractual obligations and commitments the company entered into a credit agreement the agreement as of june   in the amount of million with jpmorgan chase bank that expires on july  the agreement replaced the company s then existing million credit facility 
the agreement is available to finance working capital needs and possible future acquisitions 
among other covenants  the agreement requires the company to maintain a minimum consolidated net worth  measured quarterly  which is equal to million  plus of net income earned after april  and of the net proceeds of any offering of new equity interests issued subsequent to june  as of december   our consolidated net worth was  the agreement contains certain restrictions on our ability to create or assume liens  dispose of assets  consolidate or merge  extend credit  incur other indebtedness or pay cash dividends 
as of december   there were no borrowings outstanding under the agreement and the company was in compliance with all covenants 
as of december   the company did not have any material commitments for capital expenditures 
our principal commitments at december  consisted primarily of obligations under operating and capital leases as well as future minimum guarantees to certain vendors 
future minimum payments on these obligations are as follows payments due by period contractual obligations total thereafter capital leases    minimum guarantees   operating leases    total     operating lease amounts disclosed above include  of future operating lease costs  excluding estimated future sublease income  accrued for in the purchase accounting restructuring accruals related to the synavant and sai acquisitions

potential future impact on operating results of proposed accounting change it is anticipated that the financial accounting standards board fasb will issue an exposure draft in relating to equity based compensation that would require expensing stock options in future consolidated statements of operations 
the adoption of this proposed standard would represent a significant change from our current practice 
we have historically utilized the disclosure only provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  sfas as amended by sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure sfas to display the compensation expense relating to employee stock options in a footnote disclosure and have not adopted the optional treatment of including the compensation expense relating to employee stock options within our consolidated statements of operations 
we believe that estimating the future impact of expensing stock options provides investors with useful information concerning the company s potential future operating results 
we estimate that the future pre tax expense relating to the fair value of stock options granted prior to and outstanding as of march   calculated using the black scholes valuation method  is approximately  for the year ending december   approximately  for the year ending december   approximately  for the year ending december   and approximately  for the year ending december  the decrease from to is primarily related to the higher strike prices of options vesting in as compared to  as well as the absolute number of options vesting in these estimates have been calculated using the black scholes valuation model  which is the method that we currently use in preparing our financial statement disclosures related to employee stock options 
we are aware of the fact that the fasb is considering the adoption of a valuation method other than the black scholes model  such as the binomial lattice model  as the standard for all companies to use in estimating the value of stock options in the future 
the potential adoption of a valuation standard other than the black scholes model could cause the actual pre tax expense in future periods to differ significantly from the estimates we have presented herein 
the fair value of the options were estimated at the date of grant based on the following assumptions for the year ended december  for the period ended march  expected dividend yield expected stock price volatility weighted average risk free interest rate expected life of the option years in addition  the expenses calculated above include an annually estimated forfeiture rate of approximately annually and do not take into account future stock option grants 
the estimated forfeiture rate disclosed above may not reflect actual forfeitures 
these amounts are preliminary estimates based on our current understanding of this proposed new requirement and are subject to substantial variation based on the finally issued rules and final interpretations and applications of these rules 
they are intended only to provide order of magnitude and should not be considered or relied upon as final estimates 
no final rules or guidance have been issued nor has the proposed exposure draft of these proposed rules been issued 
these rules have been the subject of intense and active debate  and any final rules and interpretive guidance as well as final required application of the rules may result in substantial variation in the final estimated amounts 
it is expected that the company will grant future equity awards  which may be substantial and which could include awards in fiscal and subsequent years  and such equity awards would be expected to significantly increase expense under the proposed rules if adopted in the form expected 
the black scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair market value of traded options which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
in addition  option valuation models require the input of the highly subjective assumptions disclosed above 
because the company s employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair market value estimate  in management s opinion  the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of its employee stock options 
recent accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board the fasb released interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin 
fin requires that all primary beneficiaries of any variable interest entities vie consolidate that entity 
fin is effective immediately for vies created after january  and to vies to which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date 
it applies in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june  to vies in which an enterprise holds a variable interest it acquired before february  in december  the fasb published a revision to fin fin r to clarify certain provisions of the interpretation and defer the effective date of implementation for certain entities 
under the guidance of fin r  entities that do not have interests in structures that are commonly referred to as special purpose entities are required to apply the provisions of the interpretation in financials statements for periods ending after march  the company does not have any arrangements with vies that require consolidation of their financial information into our financial statements 
therefore  fin r did not have any impact on the company s consolidated financial statements or liquidity 
in november  the fasb issued eitf eitf addresses the accounting for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services or rights to use assets 
this consensus is applicable to arrangements entered into for periods after june  adopted for periods after june   eitf did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
factors that may affect future results set forth in this annual report on form k are certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements contained in this annual report on form k 
you are strongly urged to carefully consider the cautionary language and risks set forth below 
we depend on a few major customers for a significant portion of our revenues historically  a limited number of our customers have contributed a significant percentage of our revenues 
we anticipate that our operating results in any given period will continue to depend significantly upon revenues from a small number of customers 
the loss of any of these customers which could include loss through mergers and acquisitions could have a materially adverse effect on our business  operating results or financial condition 
we cannot make any assurances that we will retain our existing customers or attract new customers that would replace the revenue that could be lost if one or more of these customers failed to renew its agreement s with us 
our business is heavily dependent on the pharmaceutical industry many of our solutions are currently used in connection with the marketing and sale of prescription only drugs 
this market is undergoing a number of significant changes 
these include the significant and continuing consolidation of the pharmaceutical industry which may reduce the number of our existing and potential customers  regulatory changes that permit the over the counter sale of formerly prescription only drugs  increasing food and drug administration activism  and competitive pressure on the pharmaceutical industry resulting from the continuing shift to delivery of healthcare through managed care organizations 
we cannot assure you that we can respond effectively to any or all of these and other changes in the marketplace 
our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results or financial condition  as our business depends  in large part  on the business conditions within this marketplace 
our customers may not successfully implement our products our customers often implement our products in stages and our products are often utilized by a large number of our customers personnel 
in the event that our customer have difficulties implementing our products and services or are not fully satisfied with our products and services  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
we face risks associated with our acquisitions our business may be materially and adversely affected as a result of the significant risks associated with our acquisitions  including our recent acquisitions of synavant  sai and uto brain co 
ltd 
as part of our business strategy  we have acquired  and in the future may acquire  businesses that offer complementary products  services or technologies 
these acquisitions are accompanied by substantial risks  including unexpected problems  liabilities  risks or costs associated with the acquired business  the effect of the acquisitions on our financial and strategic position  our inability to successfully integrate the acquired business  the failure of an acquired business to further our strategies  our inability to achieve the expected cost and business synergies  the significant strain on our operating systems  the diversion of our management s attention from other business concerns  the impairment or loss of relationships with customers of the acquired business  the negative impact of the combination of different corporate cultures  the loss of key employees of the acquired company  and the maintenance of uniform  company wide standards  procedures and policies 
any of these factors could disrupt our ongoing business  distract management and employees or increase expenses  all of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and earnings 
we expect that the consideration paid for future acquisitions  if any  could be in the form of cash  stock  rights to purchase stock  or a combination of these 
to the extent that we issue shares of stock or other rights to purchase stock in connection with any future acquisition  existing shareholders will experience dilution and potentially decreased earnings per share 
while to date we have had success integrating acquired entities into our operations  we can not guarantee that we will successfully integrate this new business into our operations or achieve all of the expected cost synergies 
we may in the future acquire additional complementary companies  products or technologies 
if we do so  we may face the same risks  uncertainties and disruptions discussed above 
in addition  our profitability may suffer because of acquisition related costs or amortization costs for acquired intangible assets 
business and economic pressures on our major customers may cause a decrease in demand for our new products and services business and economic pressures on our major customers may result in budget constraints that directly impact their ability to purchase the company s new products and services offerings 
we cannot assure you that any decrease in demand caused by these pressures will not have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results or financial condition 
our lengthy sales and implementation cycles make it difficult to predict our quarterly revenues the selection of a crm or sfa solution generally entails an extended decision making process by our customers because of the strategic implications  substantial costs and significant commitment of resources associated with a customer s license or implementation of the solution 
given the importance of the decision  senior levels of management of our customers are often involved in the process and  in some instances  its board of directors may also be involved 
as a result  the lengthy decision making process typically takes nine to eighteen months  and in certain cases longer 
accordingly  we cannot fully control or predict the timing of our execution of contracts with customers 
prior sales and implementation cycles should not be relied upon as any indication of future cycles 
in addition  an implementation process of three to six or more months before the software is rolled out to a customer s sales force is customary 
however  if a customer were to delay or extend its implementation process  our quarterly revenues may decline below expected levels and could adversely affect our results of operations 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate our total revenue and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
the main factors that could cause these fluctuations are the discretionary nature of our customers purchase and budget cycles  potential delays in recognizing revenue from license transactions  seasonal variations in operating results  and variations in the fiscal or quarterly cycles of our customers 
in addition  we establish our expenditure levels for product development  sales and marketing and some of our other operating expenses based in large part on our expected future revenues and anticipated competitive conditions 
in particular  we frequently add staff in advance of new business to permit adequate time for training 
if the new business is subsequently delayed  canceled or not awarded  we will have incurred expenses without the associated revenues 
we also may increase sales and marketing expenses if competitive pressures become greater than originally anticipated 
since only a small portion of our expenses varies directly with our actual revenues  our operating results and profitability are likely to be adversely and disproportionately affected if our revenues fall below our targeted goals or expectations 
as a result of these and other factors  revenues for any quarter may be subject to fluctuation 
you should not rely on our period to period comparisons of our results of operations as indications of future performance 
our future quarterly results may from time to time not meet the expectations of market analysts or investors  which could have a materially adverse effect on the price of our common stock 
we may be unable to successfully introduce new products or respond to technological change the market for crm and sfa products changes rapidly because of frequent improvements in computer hardware and software technology 
our future success will depend  in part  on our ability to use available technologies and data sources to develop new products and services and to enhance our current products and services  introduce new solutions that keep pace with developments in our target markets  and address the changing and increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers 
we cannot assure you that we will successfully develop and market new products or product enhancements that respond to technological advances in the marketplace  or that we will do so in a timely fashion 
we also cannot assure you that our products will adequately and competitively address the needs of the changing marketplace 
competition for software products has been characterized by shortening product cycles 
we may be materially and adversely affected by this trend if the product cycles for our products prove to be shorter than we anticipate 
if that happens  our business  operating results or financial condition could be adversely affected 
to remain competitive  we also may have to spend more of our revenues on product research and development than we have in the past 
as a result  our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
software errors or defects could affect our revenues our software products are technologically complex and may contain previously undetected errors or failures or errors when products are first introduced or when updated versions are released 
we cannot assure you that  despite our testing  our new products will be free from significant errors 
software errors could cause delays in the commercial release of products until the errors have been corrected 
software errors may cause us to be in breach of our agreements with customers  which could result in termination of the agreements and monetary damages 
software errors may cause damage to our reputation and cause us to commit significant resources to their correction 
errors that result in termination of agreements  monetary damages  losses or delays could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results or financial condition 
increased competition may result in price reductions and decreased demand for our products and services solutions there are a number of other companies that sell crm and sfa products and related services that specifically target the pharmaceutical industry  including competitors that are actively selling crm and sfa software products in more than one country and competitors that also offer crm and sfa support services 
some of our competitors and potential competitors are part of large corporate groups and have significantly greater financial  sales  marketing  technology and other resources than we have 
while we believe that the crm and sfa software products and or services offered by most of our competitors do not address the variety of pharmaceutical customer needs that our solutions address  increased competition may require us to reduce the prices for our products and services 
increased competition may also result in decreased demand for our products and services 
we believe our ability to compete depends on many factors  some of which are beyond our control  including the number and success of new market entrants supplying competing crm and sfa products or support services  alliances among existing competitors  technological changes or changes in the our customers use of the internet  expansion of product lines by  or consolidation among  our existing competitors  and development and or operation of in house crm or sfa software products or services by our customers and potential customers 
any one of these factors can lead to price reductions and or decreased demand and we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to compete successfully or that competition will not have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results or financial condition 
we may not be able to compete effectively in the internet related products and services market nor can we provide assurances that the demand for internet related products and services will increase the success of parts of our business will depend  in part  on our ability to continue developing internet related products  modifying and improving our existing products and responding to technological advances and changing commercial uses of the internet 
we cannot assure you that our internet related products and services will adequately respond to such technological advances and changing uses 
nor can we assure you that the demand for internet related products and services will increase 
commercial use of the internet raises potential problems with security  privacy  reliability  accessibility  quality of service and government regulation 
these issues  if unresolved  may affect the use of our internet related products 
if these potential problems arise  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
our international operations have risks that our domestic operations do not we have expanded and may in the future expand our international operations and enter additional international markets 
this expansion would require significant management attention and financial resources that could adversely affect operating margins and earnings 
we may not be able to maintain or increase international market demand for our products and services 
if we do not  our international sales will be limited and our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
the sale of our products and services in foreign countries accounts for  and is expected in the future to account for  a material part of our revenues 
these sales are subject to risks inherent in international business activities  including any adverse change in the political stability or economic environments in these countries or regions  any adverse change in tax  tariff and trade or other regulations  the absence or significant lack of legal protection for intellectual property rights  exposure to exchange rate risk for service revenues which are denominated in currencies other than us dollars  and difficulties in managing an organization spread over various jurisdictions 
any of the above risks could have a significant impact on our ability to deliver products on a competitive and timely basis  which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition or operating results 
an inability to manage growth could adversely affect our business to manage our growth effectively we must continue to strengthen our operational  financial and management information systems  ensure that we have the appropriate infrastructure in place  and expand  train and manage our work force 
however  we may not be able to do so effectively or on a timely basis 
failure to do so could have a material adverse effect upon our business  operating results or financial condition 
catastrophic events could negatively affect our information technology infrastructure the efficient operation of our business  and ultimately our operating performance  depends on the uninterrupted use of our critical business and information technology systems 
many of these systems require the use of specialized hardware and other equipment that is not readily available in the marketplace 
although we maintain these systems at more than one location  a natural disaster  a fire or other catastrophic event at any of these locations could result in the destruction of these systems 
in such an event  the replacement of these systems and restoration of archived data and normal operation of our business could take several days to several weeks  or more 
during the intervening period when our critical business and information technology systems are fully or partially inoperable  our ability to conduct normal business operations could be significantly and adversely impacted and as a result our business  operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 
our success depends on retaining our key senior management team and on attracting and retaining qualified personnel our future success depends  to a significant extent  upon the contributions of our executive officers and key sales  technical and customer service personnel 
our future success also depends on our continuing ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical and managerial personnel 
due to competition for such personnel  we have at times experienced difficulties in recruiting and retaining qualified personnel and we may experience such difficulties in the future 
our ability to expand and increase revenue growth in the future will depend  in part  on our success in recruiting and training such qualified personnel 
we may not always be able to expand our personnel in these areas as necessary to support our operations 
any recruiting or retention difficulties could adversely affect our business  operating results or financial condition 
our business depends on proprietary rights that we may not be able to protect completely we rely on a combination of trade secret  copyright and trademark laws  non disclosure  license and other contractual agreements and technical measures to protect our proprietary rights 
we cannot assure you that the steps we take will prevent misappropriation of these rights 
further  protective actions we have taken or will take in the future may not prevent competitors from developing products with features similar to our products 
in addition  effective copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries 
in response to customer requests  we have also on occasion entered into agreements which require us to place our source code in escrow to secure our service and maintenance obligations 
further  while we believe that our products and trademarks do not infringe upon the proprietary rights of any third parties  third parties may assert infringement claims against us in the future that may result in costly litigation  diversion of management s attention  the imposition of monetary damages or injunctive relief against us 
in addition  any such claims may require us to enter into royalty arrangements 
any of these results could materially and adversely affect our business  operating results or financial condition 
if our third party vendors are unable to successfully respond to technological change or if we do not maintain our relationships with third party vendors  interruptions in the supply of our products may result some of our software is provided by third party vendors 
if our third party vendors are unable to successfully respond to technological change or if our relationships with certain third party vendors are terminated  we may experience difficulty in replacing the functionality provided by the third party software currently offered with our products 
although we believe there are other sources for all of our third party software  any significant interruption in the supply of these products could adversely impact our sales unless and until we can secure another source 
the absence of or any significant delay in the replacement of functionality provided by third party software in our products could materially and adversely affect our sales 
the results derived from current and future strategic relationships may prove to be less favorable than anticipated we are involved in a number of strategic relationships with third parties and are frequently pursuing others 
should these relationships  or any of them  prove to be more costly than anticipated or fail to meet revenue expectations or other anticipated synergies  we cannot guarantee that such events will not have a material impact upon our business  operating results or financial condition 
our data solutions are dependent upon strategic relationships which  if not maintained  could undermine the continued viability of these solutions our data and analytics solutions are sourced  in part  from data provided through strategic relationships 
although we believe there are other sources for such data  the termination of any of these relationships could diminish the breadth or depth of our data 
this termination or our failure to establish new strategic relationships in the future could negatively impact our business  operating results or financial condition 
federal and state laws and regulations could depress the demand for some of our solutions while we believe our data and analytics solutions are not violative of current federal or state laws and regulations pertaining to patient privacy or health information  including the health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa  we cannot guarantee that future laws or regulations or interpretations of existing laws and statutes will not impact negatively upon our ability to market these solutions or cause a decrease in demand for such solutions from customers that see an increased risk in any such new laws or regulations 
governmental regulation may materially and adversely affect our ability to distribute controlled substances through the mail through the interactive marketing business we acquired in the synavant acquisition  we currently may distribute controlled substances to doctors offices through the mail as part of certain interactive marketing programs provided on behalf of pharmaceutical manufacturers 
it is important to the business that this practice of distributing prescription only drugs continues 
future legislation may restrict our ability to provide these types of services 
if any such legislation is enacted  it could have a material and adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
difficulties in subleasing  selling or otherwise disposing of certain of our facilities may negatively impact upon our earnings we are currently marketing our piscataway  new jersey facility 
we also expect to sublease all or a portion of certain other facilities  including facilities acquired as part of the synavant acquisition 
if the recent real estate downturn continues  it could negatively impact upon our ability to effectively market these facilities 
an inability to successfully dispose of or sublet  as applicable  any of these facilities or to obtain favorable pricing or sublease terms could negatively impact our earnings 
unanticipated changes in our accounting policies may be required because of mandates by accounting standards setting organizations and could have a material impact on our financial statements in reporting our financial results we rely upon the accounting policies and standards then in effect at the time of our report 
future regulations  standards or interpretations may require us to adjust or restate financial results previously reported 
a required restatement could have an unfavorable impact upon past financial results or current comparison to previous results 
we may face risks associated with events which may affect the world economy the terrorist attacks of september  and other world events have weakened the world economy 
while we did not experience any material impact to our business since september   we cannot assure you that the resulting impact which the terrorist attacks  threat of future terrorist activity  or current us military action in the middle east and elsewhere  or hostilities in the middle east  asia and other geographical areas  had or may have on the us and world economies will not adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations or the businesses of our customers 
provisions of our charter documents and new jersey law may discourage an acquisition of dendrite provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation  as amended  our by laws  as amended  and new jersey law may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us 
for example  the board of directors may  without the consent of the stockholders  issue preferred stock with rights senior to those of the common stock 
in addition  we have a shareholder rights plan which may limit the ability of a third party to attempt a hostile acquisition of the company 
our common stock may be subject to price fluctuations the market price of our common stock may be significantly affected by the following factors the announcement or the introduction of new products and services by us or our competitors  quarter to quarter variations in our operating results or changes in revenue or earnings estimates or failure to meet or exceed revenue or earnings estimates  market conditions in the technology  healthcare and other growth sectors  general consolidation in the healthcare information industry which may result in the market perceiving us or other comparable companies as potential acquisition targets  the gain or loss of significant orders  changes in the domestic and international economic  political and business conditions  and future acquisitions 
further  the stock market has experienced on occasion extreme price and volume fluctuations 
the market prices of the equity securities of many technology companies have been especially volatile and often have been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
these broad market fluctuations may have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk because we have operations in a number of countries and our service agreements in such countries are denominated in a foreign currency  we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
as currency rates change  translation of the income statements of our international entities from local currencies to us dollars affects year over year comparability of operating results 
historically  we have not hedged translation risks because we generally reinvest our cash flows from international operations  however  we continue to evaluate foreign currency translation risk exposure 
management estimates that a change in foreign exchange rates would have impacted reported operating profit by approximately  this sensitivity analysis disregards the possibility that rates can move in opposite directions and that losses from one area may be offset by gains from another area 
as we continue to grow our international businesses  the risks associated with foreign currency translation will also grow 
interest rate risk we earn interest income from our balances of cash and short term investments 
this interest income is subject to market risk related to changes in interest rates  which primarily affects our investment portfolio 
we invest in instruments that meet high credit quality standards  as specified in our investment policy 
the policy also limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue  issuer and type of investment 
due to the average maturity and conservative nature of our investment portfolio  a sudden change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the value of the portfolio 
management estimates that if the average yield of the company s investments decreased by basis points  our interest income for the year ended december  would have decreased approximately  this estimate assumes that the decrease occurred on the first day of and reduced the yield of each investment instrument by basis points 
the impact on our future interest income will depend largely on the gross amount of our investments and future changes in investment yields
