item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
executive summary consolidated results of operations our financial results for were reflective of the continuing challenges faced by a number of our businesses 
consolidated revenues in were million  a decrease of million  or  from billion in declines in revenue were primarily attributable to declines in newsstand and subscription revenues at tv guide magazine and declines in subscriber and dish networks conversion revenues in our sng c band business 
our net loss decreased to million  or per diluted share  in from billion  or per diluted share  in both periods included significant pre tax charges for the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets of approximately million in and billion in publishing segment revenues in our publishing segment decreased by in  primarily due to declines in newsstand and subscription revenues at tv guide magazine of million and million  respectively 
we invested million to revitalize our tv guide magazine and the redesigned product was introduced to consumers in september the investment in editorial content and layout  as well as marketing and promotion  was made with the hope that we could stabilize circulation declines and increase advertising revenues 
in addition  with the objective of improving newsstand revenues  we announced an increase in the newsstand price to effective with the first issue of  we expect to implement a change in the second quarter of in the on sale date of the magazine to capitalize on peak shopping days  and we entered into an alliance with time distribution services  the leader in weekly magazine marketing 
cable and satellite segment revenues in the cable and satellite segment decreased by in  primarily due to continuing declines in the c band direct to home satellite market  in which our sng business operates 
in march  we entered into an agreement to sell substantially all of the assets of the c band business 
we also recently entered into new licensing and distribution agreements with four of the leading us cable and satellite distributors pursuant to which these service providers may elect to deploy a tv guide interactive ipg  their own ipg or a third party ipg 
consumer electronics licensing segment revenues in our consumer electronics licensing segment decreased by in  primarily due to declines in vcr plus revenues 
we expect vcr plus shipments and associated revenues to continue to decline 
revenues for our ce ipg business  which includes tv guide on screen and guide plus  are expected to accelerate as products incorporating our technologies are introduced into various markets  although these increases in revenues are not likely to offset the vcr plus declines in the short term 
in the longer term  we expect the fcc s recent approval of the plug and play accord between the cable and consumer electronics industry as well as expected growth in the digital television and dvd recorder markets to create opportunities to achieve increased licensing revenues from the use of our ce ipgs 
corporate segment operating expenses in the corporate segment increased  primarily due to accrued expenses in of million in litigation settlements and other contingent liabilities  higher insurance premiums  increased legal fees  expenses related to the resolution of legal issues with a former executive of a company subsidiary  and various other general and administrative expenses 
liquidity and capital resources at december   cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities excluding million of restricted cash exceeded debt and capital lease obligations by million 
in connection with the pending comcast and echostar transactions  we expect to receive cash of million and million  respectively 
we reached an agreement with our syndicate bank group to amend the terms of our term loan and revolving credit facility in june the amendments modified certain covenants in the credit agreements to address a potential compliance issue and provide the company with additional flexibility under the facilities 
by the end of the year  we paid the outstanding balance of the term loan 
because our revolving credit facility expires in february  we will explore financing alternatives to the credit facility during 
table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions in applying certain critical accounting policies 
certain accounting estimates are particularly sensitive because of their significance to our consolidated financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting the estimates could differ markedly from our current expectations 
we believe that the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of our accounting policies that affect our financial statements 
revenue recognition general we have followed the guidance of staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab  since its effective date of december  and emerging issues task force eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  since its effective date of june for revenue recognition  and analogize to the guidance in statement of position  software revenue recognition sop 
previously  we followed sop and staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
under this guidance  four conditions must be met before revenue can be recognized i there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred or service has been rendered  iii the price is fixed or determinable and iv collection is reasonably assured 
license fees we license our proprietary technologies to consumer electronics manufacturers and to service providers  including msos and other owners and operators of cable television systems  telephone networks  internet service providers  internet websites  direct to home broadcast satellite service providers  wireless systems and other multi channel video programming distributors 
it is our normal practice to enter into written agreements with our customers 
we generally recognize such license fees based on a per unit shipped model with consumer electronics manufacturers or a per subscriber model with service providers 
our revenues from per unit license fees are recognized in the period the manufacturers report the number of units shipped 
revenues from per subscriber fees are recognized in the period services are provided by a licensee  as reported to us by the licensee 
under certain agreements  manufacturers prepay license fees for a guaranteed minimum number of unit shipments over a specified period 
revenues are recognized when the manufacturers report the number of units shipped 
if any portion of the prepayment remains to be recognized as revenue at the end of the period  it is recorded as revenue in the final month of the period 
fees for shipments in excess of the minimum are recognized in the period the manufacturers report the units shipped 
see multiple element arrangements below 
revenues from annual and other license fees generally are recognized based on the specific terms of the license agreements 
for instance  we entered into certain arrangements under which substantial flat fees were paid upfront in addition to ongoing per unit license fees 
in such cases  the prepaid fees were deferred and recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the term of the agreement 
in certain cases  we will license our technology for an unlimited number of units over a specified period of time during which we have continuing obligations 
we record the fees associated with these arrangements on a straight line basis over the specified term 
in addition  we have licensing arrangements with msos under which we share a portion of the ipg advertising revenue that we generate through the mso 
in some cases  we guarantee that a substantial portion of the mso s license fees paid to us will be reimbursed to the mso through our ad sharing obligation 
to the extent the ad sharing fees are not sufficient to meet these guarantees  we are obligated to purchase advertising on the mso s platform 
because the license fee is not fixed or determinable until resolution of the sharing or advertising buyback  which is typically settled quarterly  the advertising buyback guarantees and advertising revenue sharing are netted against the license fees so that only a net license fee amount is recognized 
from time to time  the license agreement between a licensee and us may expire 
while a new license agreement is being negotiated  the licensee may continue to ship the same units or the same services may continue to be deployed containing our patented or proprietary technologies and the licensee may continue to report units shipped or subscriber information on a periodic basis 
license and subscriber fees may continue to be received at the old contract rates and on a timely basis 
in such cases  we continue to recognize license and subscriber fee revenue 
however  revenue is not recognized when collection is not reasonably assured and in no case when payment is not received for greater than days 
multiple element arrangements in accounting for multiple element arrangements  one of the key judgments to be made is the accounting value that is attributable to the different contractual elements 
the appropriate allocation of value not only impacts which segment is credited with the revenue  it also impacts the amount and timing of revenue recorded in the consolidated statement of operations during a given period due to the differing methods of recognizing revenue by each of the segments  as discussed above 

table of contents revenue is allocated to each element based on the accounting determination of the relative fair value of that element to the aggregate fair value of all elements 
the fair values must be reliable  verifiable and objectively determinable 
when available  such determination is based principally on the pricing of similar cash arrangements with unrelated parties that are not part of a multiple element arrangement 
when sufficient evidence of the fair values of the individual elements does not exist  revenue is not allocated among them until that evidence exists 
instead  the revenue is recognized as earned using revenue recognition principles applicable to the entire arrangement as if it were a single element arrangement 
at this time  in all instances where ipg advertising has been part of a multiple element transaction  no revenue has been allocated to ipg advertising for accounting purposes  and all revenue has been allocated to other elements of the transaction 
for accounting purposes  we expect to record ipg advertising associated with multiple element arrangements in this manner until such time as we conclude that we can determine the fair value of ipg advertising in a reliable  verifiable and objective manner 
impairment of long lived assets  long lived assets to be disposed of and intangible assets we review our long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
the value of our intangible assets  including goodwill  is exposed to future adverse changes if we experience declines in operating results or experience significant negative industry or economic trends or if future performance is below historical trends 
we periodically review intangible assets and goodwill for impairment using the guidance of applicable accounting literature 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the undiscounted future operating cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
we have a significant amount of property and equipment and intangible assets 
the determination as to whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable involves management s judgment 
in addition  should we conclude that recoverability of an asset is in question  the estimate of undiscounted future operating cash flows is used to determine whether an asset is recoverable and  if not  the final determination of the fair value of the asset is also based on the judgment of management 
these judgments can be impacted by a variety of underlying assumptions  such as the general business climate  effectiveness of competition and supply and cost of resources 
accordingly  actual results can differ significantly from the assumptions made by management in making its estimates 
future changes in management s estimates could result in indicators of impairment and actual impairment charges where none exist as of the date of this report 
accounting standards  which became effective january   eliminated the impairment recoverability tests for certain other intangible assets with indefinite lives and require that such assets be valued at the lower of their carrying value or fair value 
goodwill is no longer amortized but remains subject to an annual impairment test performed at the reporting unit level 
fair value is determined primarily using the estimated future cash flows associated with the asset under review  discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
changes in estimates of future cash flows could result in a write down of the asset in a future period 
absent any interim evidence of impairments  we will perform our annual impairment test of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangibles for all reporting units on october of each year 
income taxes we account for income taxes under the liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
we record a valuation allowance  if necessary  to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount management believes is more likely than not to be realized 
we have income both from foreign and domestic sources 
in the preparation of our financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate  including estimating both our actual current tax exposure and assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
assessment of our actual current tax exposure includes assessing tax strategies  the status of tax audits and open audit periods with the taxing authorities 
the ultimate resolution of our current tax exposure items may result in the recognition of significant amounts of income or significant cash outlays in future periods 
to the extent that we have deferred tax assets  we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from taxable temporary differences  tax strategies or future taxable income and to the extent that we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
as of december  and  we have established valuation allowances of million and million  respectively  against our deferred tax assets 
in the future  we may adjust our estimates of the amount of valuation allowance needed and such adjustment would impact our provision for income taxes in the period of such change 

table of contents legal and other loss contingencies a significant amount of management estimation is required in determining when  or if  an accrual should be recorded for a contingent matter and the amount of such accrual  if any 
due to the uncertainty of determining the likelihood of a future event occurring and the potential financial statement impact of such an event  it is possible that upon further development or resolution of a contingent matter  a charge could be recorded in a future period that would be material to our consolidated results of operations and financial position 
as of december  and  we had accrued million and million  respectively  for contingent matters 
allowance for doubtful accounts we have significant amounts due to us from our customers 
we continuously evaluate our outstanding accounts receivable for collectibility 
this evaluation involves management s judgment in assessing the aging of the amounts due to us and in reviewing the credit worthiness of each customer 
should a customer s financial condition deteriorate in a manner that could decrease the customer s ability to pay amounts due to us  we might be required to provide additional allowance for doubtful accounts  which would reduce our earnings 
investments our investments include investments available for sale that are carried at fair value  investments accounted for using the cost method of accounting and investments accounted for using the equity method of accounting 
a judgmental aspect of accounting for investments involves determining whether an other than temporary decline in value of the investment has been sustained 
if it has been determined that an investment has sustained an other than temporary decline in value  the investment is written down to its fair value by a charge to earnings 
such evaluation is dependent on the specific facts and circumstances related to each investment 
factors that we consider in determining whether an other than temporary decline in value has occurred include the market value of the security in relation to its cost basis  the financial condition of the subject investment  and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a sufficient period of time to allow for recovery in the market value of the investment 
for investments accounted for using the cost or equity method of accounting  management evaluates information such as budgets  business plans or financial statements in addition to quoted market price  if any  in determining whether an other than temporary decline in value exists 
factors indicative of an other than temporary decline include recurring operating losses  credit defaults  and subsequent rounds of financings at amounts below the cost basis of the investment 
this list is not all inclusive and management weighs a number of quantitative and qualitative factors in determining whether an other than temporary decline in the value of an investment is deemed to have occurred

tv guide magazine underwent its first significant redesign in many years and was relaunched in september the initial result was increased interest by corporate advertisers and an upturn in subscriptions in the fourth quarter of from the preceding quarter 
however  the environment for consumer magazines remains a difficult one with total industry advertising pages down in for the third consecutive year and continuing pressure on newsstand sales 
subscription revenues associated with the c band business continued to decline as a result of competition from dss and cable television systems 
the decline has been accelerated by our marketing alliance agreement with dish network to convert sng s c band customers to dish network s dss service 
in  operating expenses were million  a decrease of million  or less than  compared to the decrease in was primarily due to decreases of million in programming costs for sng  million in termination fees paid in that were associated with the november management and corporate governance restructuring  million related to a reserve for lease abandonment recorded by our ebook business in december  million in expenses related to our magazine wholesale distribution business  which ceased operations in and million in bad debt expense  primarily resulting from bad debt recoveries during in addition  the cost of magazine production  primarily from reduced paper and postage expenses  decreased by million 
the decreases were substantially offset in by expenses of 
table of contents million related to litigation settlements and other contingent matters and expenditures totaling million in for editorial improvements and enhanced marketing efforts designed to stabilize tv guide magazine s paid circulation and increase its advertising revenues 
in addition  legal expenses for patent related litigation and other legal matters totaled million in  an increase of million  or  from million in in addition  we recorded million in expenses to settle legal issues with a former executive of a company subsidiary 
while we expect our legal expenses to decline in  such legal expenses are expected to remain significant for the foreseeable future 
stock compensation was million in as compared with million for stock compensation in included million related to stock options held by the company s former chief executive officer and former chief financial officer 
we terminated the former executives employment for cause on april  in  the executives entered into employment agreements that provided for accelerated vesting of options granted in the period to  as well as an extended post employment exercise period to the remaining term of the options 
prior to the agreements  such options were only exercisable during the employment period with a limited post employment exercise period 
due to the extension of the post employment exercise period  a new measurement date occurred  at which time the intrinsic value of the modification was determined to be million 
the intrinsic value was computed as the difference between the exercise price per share and the stock price per share on the new measurement date multiplied by the number of options 
compensation expense was recognized only when we determined that these executives would benefit from the extension of the post employment exercise period 
as a result of the termination  we recognized a pre tax stock compensation charge of million during the three months ended march  stock compensation also includes amortization of the portion of the purchase price of acquired businesses assigned to unearned compensation for unvested stock options we assumed in the merger between us and tv guide  inc the unearned compensation is being amortized over the remaining vesting period of the options using an accelerated method 
amortization of unearned compensation totaled million and million in and  respectively 
in addition  stock compensation for included million of accelerated unearned compensation resulting from an executive who separated from the company in  and  arising from the issuance of options to the company s former chief executive officer in additionally  stock compensation in included a reversal of million related to unearned compensation amortized in the amounts were related to restricted stock that was to be issued to two former executives in connection with the management restructuring in the fourth quarter of the previously recorded expense was reversed in the second quarter of  since these executives were terminated in april and the restricted stock will not be issued 
depreciation and amortization in was million  a decrease of million  compared to million in the decrease in depreciation and amortization was primarily attributable to decreased amortization expense related to finite lived intangible assets 
during  we recorded impairment charges of billion to the carrying values of certain intangible assets with finite lives 
additionally  other finite lived intangible assets became fully amortized in we expect amortization of remaining finite lived intangible assets  assuming no change to the current group of assets  to be approximately million during however  if the echostar transaction is consummated  amortization will decline to approximately million during impairment of intangible assets in represents a write down of the carrying value of goodwill  indefinite lived intangibles and a finite lived intangible asset to their fair values 
we recorded impairment of intangible assets of million in connection with our annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets as of october  the charge included a million write down of the carrying amount of goodwill  primarily at tv guide magazine approximately million and the sng c band business approximately million  and a million write down of tv guide magazine s publishing rights and trademark 
the primary cause of this fourth quarter impairment charge was management s reassessment of the outlook for the magazine business as compared with its forecasts and expectations in  and continued erosion of the estimated fair value of the c band business as its subscriber base continues to decline 
this decline also led us to assess the carrying value of a finite lived intangible asset ascribed to the c band subscriber base  resulting in an impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter 
if we continue to operate the sng c band business and its subscriber base continues to decline  we expect to record impairment charges to goodwill and other intangible assets in future periods 
in  impairment of intangible assets was billion 
in addition to the billion impairment charge to finite lived intangible assets noted above  we also recorded impairment charges of billion and million to goodwill and trademark  respectively  based on analyses performed as of june  and october  impairment charges in were principally the result of then new management s change in strategy for the us cable and satellite ipg business  slower than expected growth in distribution and advertising revenue  and unexpected adverse rulings in certain legal cases 
in  interest expense was million  a decrease of million from  which was attributable to lower debt levels  together with lower interest rates during 
table of contents in  other expense  net was million  a decrease of million  from million in the decrease was primarily due to a million impairment charge in to the carrying value of an equity method investee see discussion in following paragraph for which no comparable charges were recorded in  million associated with the abandoned diva acquisition in and a million decrease in minority interest expense  primarily as a result of a decrease in net income reported by sng 
we have an interest in three related joint ventures that are each accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
in  the financial condition of one of these joint ventures deteriorated significantly  including a substantial decrease in its revenues and cash shortages 
because of these facts  management determined that it was unlikely that our investment would be recovered in the future  and recorded a charge of million during the fourth quarter of to write off the remaining carrying value of our investment 
this charge was recorded as other expense  net 
during the same year  this joint venture experienced an other than temporary decline in the value of its available for sale equity investments 
as a result of this decline  we recorded in other expense  net a charge of million  representing our share of this decline 
the income tax benefit as a percentage of loss before income taxes and cumulative effect of an accounting change in was compared to for the decrease in the effective tax rate in was primarily due to an increase in the valuation allowance due to the uncertainty of whether or not we will realize the benefit associated with our deferred tax assets 
the overall effective tax rate we report in any single period is impacted by  among other things  the country in which earnings or losses arise  applicable statutory tax rates and withholding tax requirements for particular countries  the availability of net operating loss carryforwards and the availability of tax credits for taxes paid in certain jurisdictions 
because of these factors  our current and future tax expense or benefit as a percentage of income or loss before income taxes may vary from period to period 
the cumulative effect of an accounting change  net of tax relates to our adoption of statement effective january  we were required to test goodwill and any intangible assets identified as having an indefinite useful life for impairment in accordance with the provisions of statement and report any transitional impairment loss as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle as of january  in the consolidated statement of operations 
the transitional impairment loss for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets from application of these rules was billion  net of tax

skymall was acquired in a transaction accounted for a purchase 
effective april  the consolidated operating results exclude the operating results of the business that distributes the wgn superstation signal  which was sold 

table of contents discussion revenues in were billion  a decrease of million or  compared to the decrease in revenues was primarily attributable to a million decrease in tv guide magazine s newsstand and subscription revenues  a million decrease in sng c band subscriber revenues  and a million decrease in license fees from dss set top box manufacturers  partially offset by a million increase in revenues at tvg 
tv guide magazine s rate base and circulation was reduced from million copies to million copies in june subsequently  that rate base was maintained through year end  although sponsored sales bulk sold subscriptions increased from a monthly average of million copies in december to million copies in december  causing subscription revenue to fall due to the lower margin of sponsored sales bulk copies versus other paid circulation 
the decrease in rate base and circulation  and general advertising weakness caused tv guide magazine s advertising revenue to decline million  although declines during the first three quarters of were offset in the fourth quarter when advertising revenues increased or million  compared to advertising revenue in the fourth quarter of subscription revenues relating to our sng c band business continued to decline in  as customers switched to cable or dss services 
the decline in subscribers was accelerated by our marketing alliance agreement with dish network to convert our c band customers to dish network s dss service 
license fee revenues relating to the sale of proprietary ipg technology to manufacturers of set top boxes for the us dss market declined dramatically in  due to slowing growth in the shipment of set top boxes  lower pricing per box due to shifts in market share  and the expiration of agreements with two key manufacturers 
revenues at tvg more than tripled due to increases in distribution and the launch of the tvg s wagering business in california 
in  operating expenses were million  a decrease of million  or  compared to the decrease in operating expenses was a result of general cost controls in effect throughout the company  reductions in tv guide magazine production expenses for paper  printing  and postage  and reduced programming costs for sng 
these decreases were partially offset by the additional expenses attributable to skymall  which was acquired in july  professional fees associated with the november management and corporate governance restructuring and the restatement of our historical financial statements  and termination fees totaling million associated with this restructuring 
stock compensation expense is primarily comprised of the amortization of the portion of the purchase price of acquired businesses assigned to unearned compensation for unvested stock options we assumed in the merger between us and tv guide  inc the unearned compensation is being amortized over the remaining vesting period of the options using an accelerated method 
also included is the amortization of deferred compensation arising from the issuance of options to the company s former chief executive officer in and amortization of deferred compensation arising from the issuance of restricted stock in connection with the management restructuring 
in  stock compensation expense was million  which included million of unearned compensation amortization and million related to restricted stock issued in connection with our management and corporate governance restructuring in in  stock compensation expenses were million  primarily consisting of unearned compensation amortization 
depreciation and amortization during  was million  a decrease of million compared to the decrease in depreciation and amortization was primarily a result of the adoption of the provisions of statement  which became effective january  statement requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead be tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of statement other intangible assets with finite lives acquired in transactions accounted for as purchases are still amortized and the amount of that amortization is significant 
impairment of intangible assets in represents a write down of the carrying amount of finite lived intangible assets billion  goodwill billion and indefinite lived intangibles million to their fair values based on analyses performed as of june  and october  interest expense was million in  a decrease of million  or  from the decrease in interest expense was attributable to lower debt levels  together with lower interest rates during 
table of contents other expense  net decreased to million in from million for the decrease in other expense  net was primarily due to a million decrease in write downs of the carrying value of certain investments  as compared with the prior year 
in  write downs for other than temporary declines in the fair value of investments aggregated million compared to million in we have an interest in three related joint ventures that are each accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
in  one of these joint ventures experienced an other than temporary decline in the value of its available for sale equity investments 
as a result of this decline  we recorded in other expense  net a charge of million  representing our share of this decline 
at december   our carrying value of this investment was million 
in  this joint venture s financial condition deteriorated significantly  including a substantial decrease in its revenues and cash shortages 
because of these facts  management determined that it was not likely that our investment would be recovered in the future  and recorded an additional charge of million during the fourth quarter of to write off the remaining carrying value of our investment 
this charge was recorded as other expense  net 
we have an investment in an entity engaged in developing a satellite system 
the entity experienced operating difficulties and a failed initial public offering 
because of these and other pertinent circumstances  we determined that our investment experienced a decline in value that was other than temporary  and that the recoverability of this investment was not likely 
as a result  during we recorded a charge of million to write off the carrying value of this investment 
this charge was recorded as other expense  net 
also  in  certain other investments experienced significant declines in value and the carrying values were deemed by management to be unrecoverable  and thus were written off  resulting in charges of approximately million recorded as other expense  net 
the income tax benefit as a percentage of loss before income taxes and cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle was in compared to in the net increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the change in the treatment of amortization of goodwill in accordance with statement  which had no associated impact on the provision for income taxes 
in addition  the overall effective tax rate we report in any single period is impacted by  among other things  the country in which earnings or losses arise  applicable statutory tax rates and withholding tax requirements for particular countries  the availability of net operating loss carryforwards and the availability of tax credits for taxes paid in certain jurisdictions 
because of these factors  it is expected that our future tax expense or benefit as a percentage of income or loss before income taxes may vary from period to period 
the cumulative effect of an accounting change relates to our adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  statement  effective january  we were required to test goodwill and any intangible assets identified as having an indefinite useful life for impairment in accordance with the provisions of statement and report any transitional impairment loss as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle as of january  in the consolidated statement of operations 
the transitional impairment loss for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets from application of these new rules was billion  net of tax 
segment results of operations effective january   we restructured our businesses into four groups that also represent our reportable business segments 
segments are now organized along three industry lines in addition to a segment comprising certain corporate functions and related expenses 
the publishing segment consists of our print and electronic publishing units and websites including tv guide magazine and gemstar ebook brands  as well as tv guide online and the skymall catalog business 
the publishing segment also includes tv guide data solutions  a data collection and distribution business that gathers program listings and channel lineups 
the cable and satellite segment offers technologies  products and services to consumers and service providers in the cable and satellite industry 
the business units in this segment include tv guide channel  tv guide interactive  tvg  sng  uvtv  spacecom and several other smaller related businesses 
the ce licensing segment is responsible for the licensing of our proprietary technologies and intellectual property to the ce manufacturing industry and interactive television software providers  and for the sale of advertising carried on the ipgs deployed in ce devices 
the ce licensing segment licenses video recording technology currently marketed under the vcr plus system brand in north america and under other brands in europe and asia  and ipgs marketed under the tv guide on screen brand in north america  under the guide plus brand in europe and under the g guide brand in asia 
this segment also has licensed intellectual property to manufacturers of set top boxes for the dss industry  and continues to license its intellectual property to interactive television software providers and program listings providers in the online  personal computer and other non television businesses 
as a result of an agreement with directv  we will no longer collect one time license fees from manufacturers of directv s set top boxes  but instead will be paid by directv on a recurring revenue model based initially on new subscribers 
revenues paid by directv will be recognized by the cable and satellite segment 
in addition  the ce licensing segment incurs costs associated with patent prosecution and certain litigation 
the corporate segment comprises various centralized functions  including corporate management  corporate legal  corporate finance and other functions  and related costs such as certain litigation and insurance costs 

table of contents prior to january   we had segmented our businesses by revenue type  which required allocation of operating results for certain business units  principally tv guide interactive  tvg and skymall  between two or more segments 
by contrast  our new segments reflect full operating results of their respective business units 
this change is intended to provide greater business unit accountability and improve the transparency of operating performance 
our previous reportable segments were identified as technology and licensing  interactive platform and media and services 
amounts for have been reclassified to conform to the presentation

adjusted ebitda is defined as operating loss income  excluding stock compensation  depreciation and amortization and impairment of intangible assets 
due to purchase accounting related to our mergers with tv guide on july  and skymall on july   the results of operations reflect significant amortization of finite lived intangible assets 
accordingly  our industry segments are measured based on adjusted ebitda 
we believe adjusted ebitda to be relevant and useful information  as adjusted ebitda is the primary measure used by our chief operating decision maker to measure the operating profits or losses of our business 

table of contents publishing segment the publishing segment primarily includes the operations of tv guide magazine  gemstar ebook  tv guide online and skymall 
in  revenues for this segment were million  a decrease of million  or  compared to the decrease was primarily due to decreased revenues earned by tv guide magazine

in exchange  sng receives an initial commission for each current or past sng subscriber who subscribes to dish network and a monthly residual commission over the life of the agreement 
sng converted approximately  subscribers in as compared with approximately  in we expect the declines in the subscriber base of the c band industry and the dish network conversions  and the resulting impact on revenues in this segment  to continue

during  tv guide channel focused on expanding its distribution through new multi year carriage agreements with cable and dss system operators  including directv 
additionally  tv guide channel debuted an expanded original programming format in january designed to attract more viewers and advertisers

in addition  we experienced a decline in reported unit shipments  partially offset by a increase in the average rate paid for units shipped in compared with vcr plus revenues in europe and asia have declined less than in north america 
vcr plus unit shipments remain strong in europe and asia where our technology has had widespread adoption in next generation recording devices such as dvrs and dvd recorders 
over time  revenues from vcr plus are likely to shift to our ce ipg products as consumers demand more advanced guidance and recording technologies 
in  revenues in the ce ipg business  which includes products marketed under the tv guide on screen brand in north america  the guide plus brand in europe and the g guide brand in asia  were million  a increase from ce ipg revenues for the years ended december  and included settlement amounts related to prior service periods of  and million  respectively 
excluding the settlement amounts  ce ipg revenues decreased primarily due to a decline in the shipment of products incorporating ce ipgs during compared with and due to reduced licensing fees paid by thomson under a new license agreement compared with fees paid under a previous agreement that was in effect during in the area of ipg technology  our ce licensing business has been adversely affected by manufacturers reluctance to incorporate our products in their analog devices because of the high cost of such incorporation 
recently however  the fcc mandated that ce manufacturers transition at least of their sales of large televisions to digital products by july the cost of incorporating our ipg products into a digital device is dramatically lower than the cost of incorporating these products into an analog device 
as manufacturers have begun to make plans for this transition  we have seen a growing interest by ce manufacturers to enter into agreements with us to incorporate our products 
the roll out of digital products incorporating tv guide on screen has begun and is expected to accelerate in late concurrent with increased shipments of digital televisions and dvrs 
in october  we received million in cash from a set top box manufacturer to settle outstanding arbitration and litigation proceedings

the million paid to thomson was netted against revenue in the second quarter of such amount was considered to be one time in nature and is therefore included in settlement amounts discussed above 
shipments of dss set top boxes decreased by less than in compared with beginning in  we expect significant declines in the dss revenues recognized by the ce licensing segment as a result of our agreement with directv 
under that agreement  dss revenues will no longer be collected from manufacturers of directv s set top boxes  but instead will be paid by directv to tv guide interactive in the cable and satellite segment on a recurring revenue model based initially on new subscribers 
as part of the multi year licensing agreement signed with thomson on june   the parties settled all past obligations between the two companies  including a resolution of all outstanding arbitration and litigation

of the million of revenue recognized in  million was related to prior service periods 
in the near term  future revenues from thomson are expected to be lower in total under the terms of the new agreement compared to the prior agreement  primarily for products incorporating ce ipg technology 
whereas the prior agreement specified a fixed annual net licensing fee of million  the new agreement bases licensing revenues on a sliding scale of per unit fees tied to the cumulative number of units shipped 
in addition  there is no minimum on the number of units required to be incorporated with our technology under the new agreement 
operating expenses in this segment were million for  a decrease of million  or  when compared to the decrease in segment expenses for over the corresponding prior year period was primarily due to a million decrease in bad debt expense due to the recovery in of amounts reserved in the prior year and due to decreases in various other general and administrative expenses

in addition  tv guide is required to maintain certain financial covenants 
as of december   tv guide was in compliance with these covenants 
the revolving facility terms also restrict the transfer of assets by tv guide to the company 
during  we determined and disclosed that tv guide may have been unable to maintain compliance with a financial covenant in its revolving facility and term loan collectively  the facilities in the succeeding months that requires it to maintain a minimum ratio of ebitda to fixed charges  as defined in the loan documents 
accordingly  effective june   tv guide and its lenders amended the facilities to  among other things  allow for a million prepayment of the term loan  which was paid in june  to be deducted from the calculation of fixed charges 
we made an additional million prepayment on the term loan in december  which further reduced fixed charges and the amount available under the revolving facility 
as a result  the term loan was paid in full 
we believe that our current financial liquidity position gives us adequate flexibility to refinance the revolving facility or seek other alternatives if we determine that we may be unable to maintain compliance with the financial covenants in the future

recent accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin  which requires variable interest entities commonly referred to as special purpose entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if certain criteria are met 
fin became effective immediately for variable interest entities created after january  for entities created before january   the provisions of fin have been delayed until march  a final determination regarding the impact of the provisions of fin will be reflected in our financial statements as of march  the effective date of certain elements of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity statement  has been delayed indefinitely by the fasb 
these elements of statement require that noncontrolling interests in limited life subsidiaries be classified as liabilities 
as a result of this indefinite delay  we have not adopted these elements of statement we have adopted the other elements of statement  for which the effective date was not delayed 
currently  we do not expect that the adoption of the remaining elements of statement will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and changes in the market values of our investments 
our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and variable rate debt issued under tv guide s million six year revolving credit facility 
we have not used derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio or to hedge for interest rate fluctuations on our debt 
we invest a majority of our excess cash in money market funds maintained with several high credit quality financial institutions 
we also invest in debt instruments of the us government and its agencies and high quality corporate issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we protect and preserve our invested funds by limiting default  market and reinvestment risk 
investments in fixed rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in fair value due to changes in interest rates 
because the interest rate on the credit facility is variable based upon the banks prime rate or libor  our interest expense and cash flow are impacted by interest rate fluctuations 
at december   outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility were million 
if interest rates were to increase or decrease by basis points  the result  based upon the existing outstanding debt  would be an annual increase or decrease of million in interest expense and a corresponding decrease or increase of million in our operating cash flow
