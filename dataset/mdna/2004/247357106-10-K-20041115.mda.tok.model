item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview outlook we reported record revenues for the fiscal year ended august  due to strong sales of our newer cottonseed products in the us and a substantial increase in soybean seed sales and international sales over licensing fees from cottonseed sales also increased over due to trait fee price increases enacted by monsanto and higher unit sales of stacked gene products coupled with a decline in technology fee rebates in for crop destruct and replant program claims 
in  much of the us cotton belt experienced excellent weather conditions during planting and much of the growing season 
these favorable weather conditions resulted in lower rebates than we experienced in under the crop destruct program  if a farmer plants transgenic seed and his crop is destroyed within sixty days of planting  monsanto  after field inspection  may forgive or waive the technology fee on the affected acreage 
our us cottonseed business also benefited from strong sales of our newer products  including dp bg rr and dp bg rr  the two most popular varieties planted in the us in dp bg rr was the most popular variety planted in the us in and  and our unit sales of this variety increased by approximately over last year 
likewise  dp bg rr sales were very strong in  the first year of wide scale commercial sales 
we believe dp bg rr sales could have been higher had we not been limited by our seed supply of this variety 
overall  we believe operating results were diminished due to a reduction in us cotton acreage from in our most profitable regions east of texas 
in a march  report issued by the united states department of agriculture usda  us cotton acreage was forecast to be million acres in  which represented an increase of approximately million acres over however  strong soybean commodity prices during the planting season resulted in a shift of acres away from cotton and into soybeans 
in september   the usda issued another report which reflected an estimate of us cotton plantings of million acres 
however  this report indicated acres were lower in areas east of texas which are more profitable to us and where we have greater market share 
the report also reflected an increase in cotton plantings over in texas  which has less profit potential for us and where we have lower market share 
our market share was stable to slightly higher in the cotton growing regions east of texas in  but declined in texas  due in part to a lack of adequate supplies of products best suited for that market 
our financial results were affected by a charge to earnings related to the acquisition of technology licenses that occurred during our fourth quarter 
our pre tax earnings were reduced by million due to this write off of acquired in process research and development ipr d and related expenses 
this charge reduced our diluted earnings per share by for fiscal year the acquisition of these licenses is a key component of our strategic plan to commercialize technologies from multiple providers and at higher fee sharing percentages to us than we have currently 
our financial results also benefited from strong soybean seed sales and a substantial improvement in our international business over soybean seed sales for increased almost over due to improved product offerings as well as an increase in soybean plantings in results of operations for the international segment almost tripled over due to an approximately increase in sales 
in particular  sales in australia  brazil  colombia  mexico  south africa and turkey increased significantly over cotton fiber commodity prices were generally higher during planting in than in this resulted in increased cotton plantings in many of our international markets 
in addition  improved product offerings  price increases  and further penetration of transgenic products led to the improvement in international results 
production costs related to our cottonseed sales were higher this year due to higher raw materials costs and freight related to sourcing seed production from the western united states and  in some cases  australia 
in addition  cost of sales increased due to an increase in the provisions for obsolete inventory 
normally  a higher percentage of products are produced in the mid south  but inclement weather destroyed most of the mid south cottonseed production prompting us to shift some production to other areas for this year 
the increased cottonseed costs partially offset the effect of our increase in cottonseed selling prices 
strategic transactions and events on august   we announced the acquisition of global licenses to develop and commercialize innovative insect resistance technology in cotton from syngenta crop protection ag syngenta 
in addition  we obtained licenses to a wide range of other syngenta enabling technologies that may be used to develop new products in both cottonseed and soybean seed 
in return for these licenses  we will pay syngenta million in installments due primarily over the next three years 
once the licensed traits are commercialized  we will receive of the net licensing revenues generated from these products 
the first product to be commercialized under the agreements is expected to be vipcot  a novel insect control trait 
depending on the timing of regulatory approval  we expect to have a limited quantity of seed available for sale as early as this agreement not only provides us with greater share of licensing revenue than we have today  but also more control of development and commercialization decisions with respect to the products 
syngenta will be responsible for obtaining regulatory approval of these products in the us and  if instructed by d pl  in other countries 
we will bear the cost of developing new varieties containing the syngenta traits and expect to incur expenses of approximately million related to this in see acquired in process research and development located in this item for further discussion 
in january  we announced a collaboration agreement with dow agrosciences llc das under which we will develop  test  and evaluate elite cotton varieties containing das insect resistant traits 
we are continuing to work with these traits 
on october   das announced it had received full epa registration for its widestrike insect protection technology and would introduce products from its subsidiary in we may commercialize varieties containing das insect resistance technology if we reach a commercialization agreement 
to date  no such commercialization agreement has been reached 
in may  we established deltamax cotton llc deltamax  a limited liability company jointly owned with verdia  inc verdia  a then subsidiary of maxygen  inc in july   verdia was acquired by dupont  which we believe brings potential for additional investment capital  strategic focus and critical mass to our collaboration  which is aimed at developing value added traits for cotton 
we are currently developing traits for insect resistance  glyphosate tolerance and nematode resistance for cotton 
we are currently transforming cotton plants for both the insect resistance and glyphosate tolerance traits 
we expect to invest up to million over the next five to eight years to fund our portion of deltamax 
other matters we are continuing to pursue our litigation against monsanto company and pharmacia 
on october   we announced that the circuit court of the first judicial district of bolivar county  mississippi the court had issued two new orders 
in the first order  which related to our damage claims  the court granted monsanto s motion for partial summary judgment relating to our claim for expectation or benefit of the bargain damages 
this ruling reversed a ruling by the previous trial judge in the case  who had ruled that the use of a benefit of the bargain damages measurement was a matter for the jury to decide 
we intend to seek an interlocutory review of this ruling by the mississippi supreme court 
our experts have calculated damages using several methods  two of which result in damage estimates of several hundred million dollars to over a billion dollars 
benefit of the bargin damages was one of those methods 
the second order related to monsanto s counterclaims in the case 
the court granted our motion to compel the production of documents and testimony of witnesses relating to monsanto s counterclaims 
monsanto had invoked privilege as a basis for not producing documents and for not permitting its witnesses to answer questions during depositions 
d pl has also sought interlocutory review by the mississippi supreme court of a september   discovery ruling relating to documents that monsanto claimed to be privileged that the original trial judge ordered monsanto to produce and that the new trial judge ordered d pl to return 
at this point  we do not expect the trial to occur in see part i  item for more information 
on may   monsanto submitted to arbitration before the american arbitration association two matters which had been in a formal dispute resolution process before a panel of senior executives since july  in the arbitration filing  monsanto is seeking an adjudication of its alleged right to terminate the bollgard and roundup ready licenses between our companies  monetary damages  as well as other items 
we have responded to this arbitration filing and denied monsanto s claims 
in addition  we have asserted counterclaims based on issues that we had submitted to the panel of senior executives 
we are committed to participating in good faith resolution of these items through the arbitration process 
see part i  item for more information 
outlook future growth in sales and earnings will be dependent on a cotton acreage in the us and around the world  b our ability to continue to profitably expand our international operations  c the successful development and launch of the syngenta insect resistance technology and d our ability to successfully develop and launch technologies that we will own or have more control over such as those being developed by deltamax cotton  llc 
due to our market position in the us  us cotton acreage has a significant effect on our sales and earnings 
as we have previously announced  we expect to provide earnings guidance later this year 
the commodity prices of cotton  soybeans  and corn have been depressed recently due to high production from the crop and other factors 
the current prices of soybeans and corn are at levels that may result in an increase in cotton plantings in the us in over however  other factors must be considered and we believe it is too early to estimate cotton plantings at this time 
we expect to have adequate supplies of seed of most of our popular cotton varieties for plantings due to favorable weather conditions in the mid south seed production areas this year 
due to inclement weather during soybean harvesting in our mid south and illinois soybean seed production areas  supplies of some popular soybean varieties may be limited 
however  final cottonseed and soybean seed supply amounts are not yet available as processing and quality assurance testing have not yet occurred for most of the product offerings 
internationally  we continue to expand our global reach and we seek to improve the operating results of our existing ex us operations 
in  operating results improved significantly due to increased sales in most of our international locations 
depending on the prices of cotton fiber at the time of plantings  we expect acreage in many of our international locations to remain constant with in addition  we have already seen an increase in cotton acreage in australia due to an increase in rains where drought conditions have existed for several years 
we also expect to see further penetration of transgenic products containing monsanto s bollgard  bollgard ii and roundup ready technologies in in australia  regulatory authorities have approved monsanto s bollgard ii and increased the area on which it may be planted versus monsanto s original bollgard product 
in addition  we expect further penetration of transgenics in colombia where they have only recently been approved for large scale planting 
we are already seeing improvements in our businesses in australia due to introduction of bollgard ii and increased acreage and brazil due to further penetration of our products 
however  it is too early to accurately forecast international results for as plantings have not yet occurred in most markets 
we will continue to develop new businesses in markets such as india and portions of africa 
we recently have formed a subsidiary  deltapine india seed private ltd  to further our business activities in india 
we continue to develop and test varieties containing new technologies from multiple sources 
we are developing products with monsanto s second generation traits  bollgard ii and roundup ready flex 
in addition  we continue to work with syngenta s vipcot traits so that these products may be commercialized as quickly as regulatory approval is received 
both monsanto and syngenta traits are being introgressed into our most elite cotton germplasm 
we believe we are uniquely positioned to rapidly introduce new technologies to both us and ex us cotton farmers due to the strength and breadth of our breeding programs and germplasm base  our technical services capabilities  know how  brand recognition and market position 
share repurchase program dividend policy our board of directors approved a common stock repurchase plan of up to million in as of october   d pl had repurchased  shares at an aggregate purchase price of million under the current purchase program 
we expect to continue purchasing shares under this plan in the open market subject to market price and other considerations 
currently  the quarterly dividend is per share 
the board of directors reviews the dividend policy quarterly 
assuming the dividend rate is maintained through  the aggregate payments will be million to the holders of the million common shares outstanding and million to the holder of the million preferred shares outstanding 
in addition  the board of directors continues to review uses of the company s cash position and alternatives for maximizing its value to shareholders 
see risks and uncertainties located in this item net sales and licensing fees in  our consolidated net sales and licensing fees increased to million from sales of million 
this increase was primarily driven by the following a an increase in licensing fee revenues due to lower payments on crop loss and replant programs  an increase in the licensing fees charged per bag  and an increase in sales of stacked gene picker products  b an increase in cottonseed prices and higher sales of our higher priced  elite varieties  c an increase in units of soybean seed sold  and  d an increase in international revenues  primarily from in country sales in australia  brazil and turkey and from export sales to mexico and colombia 
australia  brazil and turkey sales increased due to stronger demand for our products and new product introductions 
colombia sales increased due to the recent approval of transgenic varieties containing monsanto s bollgard technology while mexico s sales increase was primarily attributable to higher cotton acreage 
in  our consolidated net sales and licensing fees increased to million from sales of million 
this increase was primarily the result of a an increase in sales of stacked gene products  for which higher technology licensing fees are charged  b an increase in the selling price of our seed and the introduction of higher priced cottonseed varieties  primarily dp bg rr  and c an increase in soybean seed sales  which increased approximately in from in  domestic transgenic cottonseed sales comprised approximately of total domestic unit sales of cottonseed  compared to approximately in offsetting these increases were lower international sales and higher sales rebates associated with distributor payments  crop destruct and crop replant programs 
the decrease in international sales was mainly attributable to a decrease in sales at our joint venture in brazil due to the devaluation of the brazilian real  a decrease in export sales to greece due to high inventory levels at our distributor  and lower sales in australia due to the severe drought conditions  offset by an increase in sales at our joint ventures in china 
gross profit our consolidated gross profit increased to million in compared to million in consolidated gross profit as a percentage of consolidated net sales and licensing fees was consistent with the prior year at 
the revenue increase attributable to the adoption of higher priced products was offset by lower margins on soybean sales caused by higher costs of soybean raw materials and an increase in both cottonseed production costs and in the provision for damaged  obsolete and excess cottonseed inventory 
our consolidated gross profit increased to million in compared to million in consolidated gross profit as a percentage of consolidated net sales and licensing fees was flat with at 
price increases and the introduction of higher priced varieties were partially offset by an increase in cottonseed cost caused by higher raw materials costs and freight related to sourcing seed production from the western united states and australia

operating expenses for included special charges of million 
excluding the in process research and development and related transaction costs in and the special charges recorded in  the increase in operating expenses in versus was approximately million 
this increase primarily relates to higher research and development costs associated with new technologies and an increase in general and administrative expenses  primarily related to higher professional fees for legal matters and sarbanes oxley compliance 
operating expenses increased to million in from million in operating expenses for included special charges of million 
excluding the special charges recorded in  this increase is primarily due to increased compensation  pension and payroll related costs  higher insurance premiums and professional fees 
research and development expenses research and development expenses increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily attributable to increased costs of working with new technologies  including the addition of new personnel positions and increased testing program expenses 
research and development expenses were virtually unchanged from the prior year at million in compared to million in the increase was primarily attributable to increased international research and development activities 
in the consolidated statements of income  certain expenses historically classified as research and development in operating expenses have been reclassified as cost of sales 
the expenses as well as the prior years have been reclassified for consistency 
the expenses relate to certain activities performed by the technical services department 
as the sales of transgenic varieties have increased as a percentage of our net sales and licensing fees over the past several years  certain technical services department activities have become more related to preparing seed for sale than to research and development activities 
the activities for which expenses have been reclassified relate primarily to the increase of seed quantities to allow us to offer certain varieties commercially and to late stage trials performed to ensure that varieties that have been chosen to be offered commercially meet agronomic and transgenic requirements of our third party technology licenses 
the amount of expenses reclassified for  and was million  million and million  respectively 
selling expenses selling expenses increased to million in from million in this increase was primarily attributable to higher advertising costs 
selling expenses increased to million in from million in this increase was primarily attributable to an increase in advertising expenditures related to the introduction of new varieties 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in the increase primarily related to an increase in professional fees incurred  mainly due to legal matters and sarbanes oxley compliance 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in the increase mainly related to increases in compensation and pension costs  as well as an increase in legal fees related to licensing activities 
special charges there were no special charges recorded in or in  we recorded a million charge associated with additional expenses for the closing of our chandler  arizona plant and the closing of our facility in centre  alabama and a million charge associated with reductions in the number of employees at our wholly owned subsidiary in australia and at our joint venture in hebei province  people s republic of china

off balance sheet arrangements we do not currently utilize off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual obligations amounts in thousands we have certain obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts 
current estimates of our future payments under these obligations are shown in the following table 
payments due in fiscal year ending august  total and beyond long term obligations      operating lease obligations purchase obligations total      see acquired in process research and development located in this item for information concerning non contingent payments related to the syngenta transaction 
the amount reported as purchase obligations for relates to guaranteed payments to be made to cotton growers and producers for a portion of seed that we will purchase in the first and second quarters of the fiscal year for sales in that fiscal year 
at august   we had open purchase contracts with many cotton and soybean growers  producers and conditioners that may require us to purchase minimum amounts of cotton and soybean seed if that seed meets our quality assurance standards 
the amount that we will pay for the seed that we accept is based on market prices that fluctuate 
the amount of seed that we will accept and the unit prices that we will pay cannot be known until that seed is delivered to us which will occur in the first and second quarters of our fiscal year and is tested for quality 
application of critical accounting policies overview management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing in item of our annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended august  the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we have identified below the accounting policies that involve those estimates and assumptions that we believe are critical to an understanding of our financial statements 
our management has discussed the development and selection of each critical accounting estimate with the audit committee of our board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed the related disclosures below 
since application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of estimates  actual results could differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition revenues from domestic seed sales are recognized when the seed is shipped 
revenues from bollgard and roundup ready licensing fees are recognized when the seed is shipped 
domestically  the licensing fees charged to farmers for bollgard and roundup ready cottonseed are based on pre established planting rates for each of nine geographic regions and  for years prior to  considered the estimated number of seed contained in each bag which varied by variety  location grown  and other factors 
effective this year  picker and stripper cottonseed products were sold in bags containing approximately  seed or bulk boxes containing approximately  seed 
acala and pima cottonseed products continue to be sold in pound bags 
international export revenues are recognized upon the later of when the seed is shipped or the date letters of credit or instruments with similar security provisions are confirmed 
international export sales are not subject to return except in limited cases in mexico and colombia 
all other international revenues from the sale of planting seed  less estimated reserves for returns  are recognized when the seed is shipped  except in australia where certain immaterial revenues are recognized when collected 
all of our domestic seed products including those containing bollgard and roundup ready technologies are subject to return and credit risk  the effects of which vary from year to year 
the annual level of returns and  ultimately  net sales are influenced by various factors  principally commodity prices and weather conditions occurring in the spring planting season during our third and fourth quarters 
we provide for estimated returns as sales occur 
to the extent actual returns differ from estimates  adjustments to our operating results are recorded when such differences become known  typically in our fourth quarter 
all significant returns occur or are accounted for by fiscal year end 
therefore  the application of this estimate could affect our quarterly information 
domestically  we promote our cotton and soybean seed directly to farmers and sell our seed through distributors and dealers 
we also offer various sales incentive programs for seed and participate in such programs related to the bollgard and roundup ready technology fees offered by monsanto 
under these programs  if a farmer plants his seed and the crop is lost usually due to inclement weather by a certain date  a portion of the price of the seed and technology fees are forgiven or rebated to the farmer if certain conditions are met 
the amount of the refund and the impact to d pl depends on a number of factors including whether the farmer can replant the crop that was destroyed 
we record monthly estimates to account for these programs 
the majority of program rebates occur during the second  third  and fourth quarters 
essentially all material claims under these programs have occurred or are accounted for by fiscal year end 
provision for damaged  obsolete and excess inventory each year  we record a provision to adjust our reserves related to inventory based on our estimate of seed that will not pass our quality assurance qa standards at year end  or is deemed excess based on our desired seed stock level for a particular variety dump seed 
seed can fail qa standards based on physical defects ie  cut seed  moisture content  discoloration  etc  germination rates  or transgenic purities 
the amount recorded as inventory provision in a given year is calculated based on the total quantity of inventory that has not passed qa standards at any fiscal year end  any seed that is expected to deteriorate before it can be sold and seed deemed to be excess 
in establishing the provision  we consider the scrap value of the seed to be disposed 
an initial estimate of the needed provision is made at the beginning of each year and recorded over the course of the year 
adjustments for changes in our estimates are made monthly  if necessary 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item for further details about inventory reserves 
deferred income taxes deferred income taxes are estimated based upon temporary differences between the income and losses that we report in our financial statements and our taxable income and losses as determined under applicable tax laws 
we estimate the value of deferred income taxes based on existing tax rates and laws  and our expectations of future earnings 
for deferred income taxes  we applied a composite statutory income tax rate of 
we are required to evaluate the likelihood of our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income that will enable us to realize the value of our deferred tax assets 
if  in our judgment  we determine that we will not realize deferred tax assets  then valuation allowances are recorded 
as of august   we had recorded net deferred tax assets of approximately million primarily related to capitalizing the licenses from syngenta for income tax reporting purposes 
we estimate that our deferred tax assets will be realized  therefore  we have not recorded any valuation allowances as of august  we use management judgment and estimates when estimating deferred taxes 
if our judgments and estimates prove to be inadequate  or if certain tax rates and laws should change  our financial results could be materially adversely impacted in future periods 
contingent liabilities a liability is contingent if the amount is not presently known  but may become known in the future as a result of the occurrence of some uncertain future event 
d pl estimates its contingent liabilities based on management s estimates about the probability of outcomes and its ability to estimate the range of exposure 
accounting standards require that a liability be recorded if management determines that it is probable that a loss has occurred and the loss can be reasonably estimated 
in addition  it must be probable that the loss will be confirmed by some future event 
as part of the estimation process  management is required to make assumptions about matters that are by their nature highly uncertain 
the assessment of contingent liabilities  including legal contingencies and income tax liabilities  involves the use of critical estimates  assumptions and judgments 
management s estimates are based on their belief that future events will validate the current assumptions regarding the ultimate outcome of these exposures 
however  there can be no assurance that future events  such as court decisions or irs positions  will not differ from management s assessments 
whenever practicable  management consults with third party experts attorneys  accountants  claims administrators  etc 
to assist with the gathering and evaluation of information related to contingent liabilities 
acquired in process research development in august  we entered into an agreement with syngenta to purchase global licenses to develop and commercialize syngenta s insect resistance genes known as vipa and cryab in cottonseed 
in addition  we purchased licenses to other syngenta enabling technologies that may be useful in developing valuable new products for use in cottonseed and soybean seed 
in return for the licenses  d pl is to pay syngenta million 
the purchase price will be paid in installments over seven years 
fixed payments of million will be made  primarily over the next three years 
in  d pl will make certain decisions which will determine whether the additional million in contingent payments will be made 
for the year ended august   we recorded a charge of approximately  related to the write off of the acquired in process research and development ipr d and related transaction costs 
approximately  of the purchase price represents the fair value of the non contingent payments related to the acquired ipr d projects that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
accordingly  this amount was immediately expensed in the consolidated statement of income on the acquisition date 
the remaining  of the charge incurred represents the related transaction costs  primarily professional fees 
the assigned value of each of the technologies acquired was as follows vipa  cryab  other  the vipa and cryab projects vipcot represent new technologies that are expected to compete with insect resistance technologies currently on the market  including technologies that are currently contained in varieties sold by us 
the vipa and cryab genes produce proteins that are toxic to certain lepidopteran larvae  the principal cotton pests in many cotton growing areas 
the acquired vipa gene provides for a novel mode of action for attacking larvae that consume the protein 
vipcot will require further development by us  including the introgression into our elite germplasm 
we estimate that we will incur the following costs to complete the projects     these projects will also require regulatory approval from the food and drug administration fda  the us department of agriculture usda  and the us environmental protection agency epa before commercialization can begin 
syngenta is responsible for us regulatory approval 
syngenta has advised us that they expect us regulatory approval to be obtained for the selected vipa event in  prior to the planting season  and for the selected cryab event in  prior to the planting season 
if the regulatory approval process proceeds as expected  we may begin limited introduction of the vipa event in and the cryab event in once commercialization begins  we will owe syngenta a royalty equal to of the net license fees received  after deduction of certain expenses  from these technologies 
we will retain the remaining of the net license fees 
there is no assurance that these technologies will result in commercially viable products or that such technologies are developed in the time frame or for the amounts estimated to complete 
also  there is no assurance that regulatory approval will be obtained for the products 
liquidity and capital resources in the united states  we purchase seed from contract growers in our first and second fiscal quarters 
seed conditioning  treating and packaging commence late in the first fiscal quarter and continue through the third fiscal quarter 
seasonal cash needs normally begin to increase in the first fiscal quarter and cash needs peak in the third fiscal quarter 
cash is generated and loan repayments  if applicable  normally begin in the middle of the third fiscal quarter and are typically completed by the first fiscal quarter of the following year 
in some cases  we offer customers financial incentives to make early payments 
to the extent we attract early payments from customers  bank borrowings  if any  are reduced 
in the us  we record revenue and accounts receivable for licensing fees on bollgard and roundup ready seed sales upon shipment  usually in our second and third fiscal quarters 
receivables from seed sales generally become due in may and june 
the licensing fees are due in september  at which time we receive payment 
we then pay monsanto its royalty for the bollgard and roundup ready licensing fees  which is recorded as a component of cost of sales 
as a result of the timing of these events  licensing fees receivable and royalties payable peak at our fiscal year end  august the seasonal nature of our business significantly impacts cash flow and working capital requirements 
historically  we have maintained credit facilities  and used early payments by customers and cash from operations to fund working capital needs 
in the past  we have borrowed on a short term basis to meet seasonal working capital needs 
however  in fiscal years  and  we used cash generated from operations and other available cash to meet working capital needs 
we continue to evaluate potential uses of our cash for purposes other than for working capital needs 
potential uses of our cash may be the acquisition of  or funding of  alternative technologies such as  or in addition to  deltamax and syngenta that could be used to enhance our product portfolio and ultimately our long term earnings potential and or an investment in new markets outside the us another potential use is the repurchase in the open market of our shares pursuant to our previously announced share repurchase program 
we are currently considering other potential uses of the remaining cash  including increasing the dividend rate or repurchasing shares more aggressively depending on market considerations and other factors 
as a part of this analysis  we are evaluating the company s liquidity needs and its capital structure 
in april  we entered into a syndicated credit facility with three lenders  which provided for aggregate borrowings of million 
this agreement expired on april  we have had discussions with several potential lenders about a replacement facility 
capital expenditures were million  million  and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
we anticipate that capital expenditures will approximate to million in annual dividends of  and per share were paid in  and  respectively 
aggregate dividends paid on common and preferred shares in  and were million  million and million  respectively 
on july   we announced that our board of directors had declared a per share dividend for the fourth quarter 
the fourth quarter dividend  payable to shareholders of record on august   was paid on september  in the first quarter of fiscal  the board of directors authorized a quarterly dividend of per share to be paid on december   to shareholders of record on november  the board anticipates that quarterly dividends of per share will continue to be paid in the future  however  the board of directors reviews this policy quarterly 
aggregate preferred and common stock dividends should approximate million in in february  the board of directors authorized a program for the repurchase of up to million of our common stock 
the shares repurchased under this program are to be used to provide for option exercises  conversion of our series m convertible non voting preferred shares and for other general corporate purposes 
at august   we had repurchased  shares at an aggregate purchase price of approximately million under this program 
during the year ended august   we purchased  shares at an aggregate purchase price of million under this plan 
during the quarter ended august   we purchased  shares at an aggregate price of million 
cash provided from operations  cash on hand  early payments from customers and borrowings under a loan agreement  if necessary  should be sufficient to meet the company s working capital needs 
risks and uncertainties from time to time  we may publish forward looking statements relating to such matters as anticipated financial performance including when earnings estimates are discussed  existing products  technical developments  new products  new technologies  research and development activities  and similar matters 
the private securities litigation reform act of provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements 
in order to comply with the terms of the safe harbor  we note that a variety of factors could cause our actual results and experience to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in our forward looking statements 
the risks and uncertainties that may affect the operations  performance  development and results of our business include those noted elsewhere in this filing and the following demand for our seed will be affected by government programs and policies and by weather 
demand for seed is also influenced by commodity prices  the cost of other crop inputs  and the demand for a crop s end uses such as textiles  animal feed  cottonseed oil  food and raw materials for industrial use 
these factors  along with weather  influence the cost and availability of seed for subsequent seasons 
weather impacts crop yields  commodity prices and the planting decisions that farmers make regarding both original planting commitments and  when necessary  replanting levels 
the planting seed market is highly competitive  and our products face competition from a number of seed companies  diversified chemical companies  agricultural biotechnology companies  governmental agencies and academic and scientific institutions 
a number of chemical and biotechnology companies have seed production and or distribution capabilities to ensure market access for new seed products and new technologies that may compete with the bollgard and roundup ready gene technologies of monsanto  our principal licensor of such technology 
our seed products and technologies contained therein may encounter substantial competition from technological advances by others or products from new market entrants 
many of our competitors are  or are affiliated with  large diversified companies that have substantially greater resources than we have 
we currently are engaged in a dispute resolution and arbitration process with monsanto  the principal licensor of our cotton technology 
in the arbitration  monsanto is seeking a determination by the arbitrators of its right to terminate certain agreements between our companies  including the bollgard and roundup ready licenses
