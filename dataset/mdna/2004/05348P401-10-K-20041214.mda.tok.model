item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements concerning future events and performance of our company 
you should not rely excessively on these forward looking statements  because they are only predictions based on our current expectations and assumptions 
when used in this report  the words intend  estimate  anticipate  believe  plan and expect and similar expressions as they relate to avanir are included to identify forward looking statements 
many factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated in these forward looking statements 
you should review carefully the factors identified in this report as set forth below and under the caption risk factors that might affect future operations 
we disclaim any obligation to update or announce revisions to any forward looking statements to reflect actual events or developments 
except as otherwise indicted herein  all dates referred to in this report represent periods or dates fixed with reference to the calendar year  rather than our fiscal year ending september overview avanir pharmaceuticals is a drug discovery and development company focused primarily on novel treatments for chronic diseases 
avanir is currently developing neurodex tm for the treatment of pseudobulbar affect pba and for the treatment of chronic diabetic neuropathic pain 
we have successfully completed two phase iii trials of neurodex in the treatment of pba in patients with multiple sclerosis ms and with lou gehrig s disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or als  and one phase ii trial for the treatment of diabetic neuropathic pain 
we also have a potential product for allergy and asthma  avp  which is in phase i clinical development 
our clinical and preclinical research and drug discovery programs are focused primarily on small molecules that can be taken orally as therapeutic treatments 
other small molecule research programs include potential treatments for atherosclerosis and inflammation  which are both in the preclinical development stage 
using our proprietary xenerex tm technology  we are also conducting research to develop injectable human monoclonal antibody products for anthrax  cytomegalovirus  and other infectious diseases 

table of contents the following chart illustrates the approximate status of research activities for our products and product candidates that are under development 
clinical preclinical activities graph we strive to maintain a lean organizational structure while working on a diverse product development pipeline 
we also strive to maintain flexibility in our cost structure  by managing over outsourced functions such as clinical trials  market research  legal counsel and portions of chemistry  rather than maintain all of these functions in house 
while outsourcing can lead to higher costs in some cases  we believe the benefits of being flexible  and being able to rapidly respond to program delays  or successes  and the availability of capital to advance our programs  far outweigh the disadvantages 
however  even with a lean  flexible organization  the continued development of our current product candidates and the potential launch of neurodex will require substantial additional capital 
we intend to partner with pharmaceutical companies that can help fund our research and development programs in exchange for sharing in the rights to commercialize new drugs 
we have licensed certain rights to docosanol cream and continue to seek licensees for that product and potential products in our pipeline 
research collaborations also represent a significant way to achieve our development goals by sharing the risks and the opportunities that come from such development efforts 
we expect that our development and operational costs will continue to exceed revenues from existing sources through at least fiscal we will have to raise significant amounts of additional capital to continue our research and development activities  prepare for potential product launch of neurodex for pba and fund other operating activities 
our future capital needs will depend substantially on the economic terms and the timing of any new partnership or collaborative arrangements with pharmaceutical companies under which they will share the costs of such activities 
if we are unable to raise capital as needed to fund our operations  or if we are unable to enter into any such collaborative arrangements  then we may need to slow the rate of development of some of our programs or sell the rights to one or more of our drug candidates 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires that management make a number of assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
management bases its estimates on historical information and assumptions believed to be reasonable 
although these estimates are based on management s best knowledge of current events and circumstances that may impact the company in the future  actual results may differ from these estimates 
our critical accounting policies are those that affect our financial statements materially and involve a significant level of judgment by management 
our critical accounting policies regarding revenue recognition are in the following areas milestone payments in license agreements  royalties on licensed products  sale of rights to future royalties  and recognition of revenues in research contracts 
our critical accounting policies also include recognition of expenses in research contracts and the capitalization and valuation of intangible assets 
milestone payments in license agreements we recognize revenues from license fees when the performance requirements have been met  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection of fees is probable 
we defer revenues and recognize them ratably over the life of the agreement when we have continuing obligations to perform under the agreement 
our largest and most significant license agreement is with sb pharmco puerto rico  inc  a subsidiary of glaxosmithkline glaxosmithkline 
on march   we transferred the rights to manufacture  use  and sell abreva in the united states and canada to glaxosmithkline and gave them full control  authority and responsibility over research  development  regulatory compliance activities including actions required to obtain appropriate government approvals  and commercialization of the product in those territories 
glaxosmithkline has achieved and paid all of the performance milestones under the agreement  and we have no further performance obligations 
future revenues  if any  to be earned under the glaxosmithkline agreement will come solely from royalty revenues 
we entered into additional agreements this year and expect to enter into additional license agreements in the future 
we expect that each license agreement will have its own set of circumstances and terms of performance 
we will consider the specific facts and circumstances of each license agreement to determine the appropriate revenue recognition for such items  including nonrefundable up front fees  data transfer fees  and milestone payments and taking into consideration when the earnings process is complete and collection is reasonably assured 
royalties on licensed products we recognize royalty revenues from our licensed products based on the reported sales by our licensees and computed in accordance with the specific terms of the license agreements 
since the launch of abreva in october through september   substantially all of our royalties have come from glaxosmithkline 
we have entered into additional license agreements that contain royalties as a source of revenues  and we expect to enter into additional similar license agreements with foreign based companies in the future 
sale of rights to future abreva royalties in fiscal  we sold an undivided interest in our license agreement with glaxosmithkline to drug royalty usa for million 
because of our ongoing involvement with glaxosmithkline in earning future royalty revenues  we have recorded the amounts received from drug royalty usa  net of costs of the transaction and forgiveness of certain advances  as deferred revenue 
the amount recorded as deferred revenue is being recognized as revenue under the units of revenue method over the period from october through april under this method  the amount of deferred revenue being recognized as revenue in each period is calculated by multiplying i the ratio of the royalty payments due to drug royalty usa for the period to the 
table of contents total remaining royalties that we expect sb will pay drug royalty usa over the term of the agreement  by ii the unamortized deferred revenue amount 
the variance in revenues from quarter to quarter under this method has been as much as  in fiscal the portion of deferred revenue classified as a current liability represents the amount we expect to realize as revenue within the next months 
see note  summary of significant accounting policies deferred revenue  in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
recognition of revenues in research contracts we may enter into research contracts or collaborations that have obligations to deliver to the customer multiple products and or services multiple deliverables in exchange for fees or milestone payments 
such contracts could include antibody generation services agreements and other forms of research collaborations  as discussed below 
antibody generation services 
as of september   we had  in deferred revenue related to a research collaboration agreement that had research initiation fees 
in this type of agreement  the customer provides us with the target antigens 
we then perform research services to develop potential antibodies for those antigens 
if we are able to estimate the period of service in the contract in advance of beginning the work  then we recognize such research initiation fees ratably as revenue over the estimated period of service 
if we are unable to identify the period of service in the contract in advance of beginning the work  we defer research initiation fees and recognize such fees as revenue only when we have completed our efforts to create the antibodies 
in the research phases of the research collaboration agreement  we may receive payment either to start a research phase or to complete a research phase including receipt by the customer of the deliverable 
we recognize revenue once the product has been delivered because the earning process is complete and an exchange has been made 
factors taken into consideration in recognizing revenues include the following the performance criteria have been met  any deliverable products or services are not essential to the functionality of the delivered products or services  and payment for the delivered products or services is not contingent on delivery of the remaining products or services 
other research contracts 
as with all our research contracts  including the up front initiation fee  we defer revenue recognition until services have been rendered or products eg developed antibodies are delivered 
the milestones established within the contract are typically set to approximate the effort associated with the completion of each phase 
recognition of expenses in research contracts pursuant to management s assessment of the progress that has been made on clinical trials and services provided in other research contracts  we recognize expenses as the services are provided 
several of our contracts extend across multiple reporting periods  including our largest contract valued at approximately million as of september  a variance in our estimate of the percent completed in our largest contract could increase or decrease our operating expenses by  such contracts require an assessment of the work that has been completed during the period  including measurement of progress  analysis of data that justifies the progress  and finally  management s judgment 
we assess our obligations to make milestone payments that may become due under licensed or acquired technology to determine whether the payments should be expensed or capitalized 
we charge milestone payments to research and development expense when the technology is in the early stage of development and has no alternative uses  there is substantial uncertainty of the technology or product being successful  there will be difficulty in completing the remaining development  and there is substantial cost to complete the work 

table of contents capitalization and valuation of intangible assets we capitalize legal costs incurred in connection with patents  patent applications pending  trademark applications and license agreements 
we amortize costs of approved patents and license agreements over their estimated useful lives  or terms of the agreements  whichever are shorter 
for patents pending  we amortize the costs over the shorter of a period of twenty years from the date of filing the application or  if licensed  the term of the license agreement 
we re assess the useful lives of patents when they are issued  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the useful lives may have changed 
for patent and trademark applications that we abandon  we charge the remaining unamortized accumulated costs to expense 
avanir s amortizable intangible assets consist of the costs of patents  patent applications  and licenses 
intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
if the review indicates that long lived assets are not recoverable ie the carrying amount is less than the future projected undiscounted cash flows  their carrying amount would be reduced to fair value 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include the following a significant underperformance relative to the expected historical or projected future operating results  a significant change in the manner of our use of the acquired asset or the strategy for our overall business  and or a significant negative industry or economic trend 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangible assets or long lived assets are not recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets that have not been previously recorded 
as of september   our largest group of intangible assets with finite lives was for our ige down regulation technology  having net intangible assets of approximately million 
any setback or failure in our ige technology  currently in phase i clinical development for the treatment of allergy and asthma  could cause a re assessment of the value of this technology and possible write down of all or a portion of the costs of these assets 
nature of operating expenses avanir s operating expenses are influenced substantially by the amount of spending devoted to clinical development programs and drug discovery research 
during the past three years  we have substantially expanded our drug development pipeline  which requires that we allocate significant amounts of our resources to research and development activities and professional and consulting fees related to clinical trials programs  which also have increased substantially over the same period 
we expect research and development expenses will represent approximately of our operating expenses for fiscal  compared with for fiscal  as we embark on pre launch planning and sales and marketing programs for neurodex 
other than research and development  our operating expenses are primarily related to sales and marketing and general and administrative areas 
we expect that sales and marketing will increase as a percentage of total operating expenses in fiscal  compared to fiscal we attribute the increased allocation to sales and marketing to our medical education and marketing programs for neurodex 
the balance of spending relates to general and administrative functions  including the company s board of directors  securities compliance  corporate governance  human resources  finance and investor relations 
our spending on general and administrative support staff tends to follow trends in other areas  but to a lesser extent 
general and administrative expenses have tended to increase since the adoption of the sarbanes oxley act of occupancy costs  including building rent  utilities  maintenance  operation of our laboratory and office facilities  insurance and depreciation  are allocated to the various departments based on headcount 
building rent amounting to approximately million in fiscal has scheduled rent increases of approximately a year for at least the next three years 

table of contents our business is exposed to significant risks  as discussed in the section entitled risk factors that might affect future operations  which may result in additional expenses  delays and lost opportunities that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
effects of inflation we believe the impact of inflation and changing prices on net sales revenues and on operations has been minimal during the past three years 
results of operations comparison of fiscal and revenues vs 
revenues in fiscal amounted to million  including million from the recognition of deferred revenue relating to the sale of an undivided interest in our abreva license agreement to drug royalty usa see note  summary of significant accounting policies deferred revenue  in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements   in sales of the active ingredient docosanol to licensees   from government research grants  and  from milestones and fees earned in license agreements 
revenues from government research grants included preclinical development of docosanol as a potential treatment for genital herpes  and preclinical research on a potential antibody to anthrax 
revenues for fiscal amounted to million  including million from the recognition of deferred revenue relating to the sale of an undivided interest in our abreva license agreement   from government research grants and  in docosanol product sales 
during fiscal  we expect to recognize approximately million in revenues from the recognition of deferred revenue relating to the sale of an undivided interest in our abreva license agreement and  in revenues from research being performed under government research grants 
we expect sales of the active ingredient docosanol will be less than  in fiscal projected fiscal revenues from new sources  such as license fees and milestone payments  will depend substantially on our ability to enter into additional license arrangements and achieve milestones under those arrangements 
such arrangements could be in the form of licensing or partnering agreements for docosanol cream  neurodex  or for our other product development programs including potential treatments for pba  allergy and asthma  inflammation and atherosclerosis 
many of our product development programs could take years of additional development before they reach the stage of licensing  if ever  by other pharmaceutical companies 
revenue generating contracts partnering  licensing and research collaborations have been  and will continue to be  an important part of avanir s business development strategy 
we intend to partner with pharmaceutical companies that can help fund avanir s research in exchange for sharing in the rights to commercialize new drugs resulting from this research 
we have licensed and continue to seek licensees in other countries for docosanol cream and other potential products in our development pipeline 
research collaborations also represent an important way to achieve our development goals  while sharing in the risks and the opportunities that come from such development efforts 
commercial contracts that remained active at the end of fiscal include seven docosanol cream license agreements  one antibody license and one neurodex sublicense 
the abreva license arrangement has been our most significant revenue source during the past four years  accounting for a majority of revenues in each of those years 
expenses vs 
operating expenses 
total operating expenses amounted to million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal the million or increase in operating expenses was primarily caused by a million or increase in spending on research and development programs including a million charge in fiscal related to the issuance of common stock to the ciblex corporation  in lieu of potential 
table of contents future milestone payments related to our mif technology 
clinical development of neurodex for the treatment of pba remained the leading research and development program for fiscal  accounting for million or approximately of all research program spending 
we also incurred a million or increase in general and administrative expense and an  or increase in sales and marketing 
research and development programs accounted for and of total operating expenses for fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in general and administrative expenses  which accounted for of total operating expenses for fiscal and  was primarily attributable to increases in legal  consulting and other costs associated with corporate governance and compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of the increase in sales and marketing  which accounted for and of total operating expenses for fiscal and  respectively  was primarily because of increased medical education and marketing activities related to neurodex 
these and other costs are more fully described below 
operating expenses three months twelve months ended ended september  september  operating expenses research and development general and administrative sales and marketing costs of sales total operating expenses research and development r d expenses 
r d expenses totaled million in fiscal  including the issuance of million in common stock in connection with the mif technology  compared to million in fiscal see note  summary of significant accounting policies research and development expenses in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
higher r d spending for fiscal  other than for the mif technology  was primarily related to clinical development of neurodex for the treatment of pba 
neurodex had a higher number of patients enrolled in both the phase iii clinical trial and the open label safety study in the treatment of pba in fiscal  which resulted in a million or increase over fiscal program spending 
costs associated primarily with phase i clinical trials of avanir s lead compound for the treatment of allergies and asthma accounted for of total r d spending in fiscal the balance of r d spending was for other programs  including pre clinical research related to the development of compounds for the treatment of inflammation and atherosclerosis and antibody research programs 
in fiscal  the clinical trials of neurodex for the treatment of pba in patients with ms accounted for of all r d spending 
costs associated with completion of toxicology  submitting an ind  and initiating phase i clinical trials of avanir s lead compound for the treatment of allergies and asthma accounted for of total r d spending 
the balance of r d spending was for other programs  including clinical research of neurodex for the treatment of neuropathic pain  pre clinical research related to the development of compounds for the treatment of inflammation and atherosclerosis  and antibody research programs 
pharmaceutical r d programs  by their very nature  require a substantial amount of financial and human resources and there is no assurance that any drug candidate will be approved for marketing by domestic and or foreign regulatory agencies 
the later stages of clinical development typically require substantially greater funds for development than the earlier stages 
thus  for many of our larger development programs  we intend to license our technology or partner with other pharmaceutical companies that have substantially greater financial resources 
we expect that our licensees will continue to develop and fund those projects and pay us up front license fees  data transfer fees  milestone payments  and royalties on product sales if those products are successfully developed and approved for marketing by the us food and drug 
table of contents administration fda and foreign regulatory agencies 
we caution that many of our development efforts could experience delays  setbacks and failures  with no assurance that any of our clinical research or our potential licensees or partners will ever reach the stage of an nda with the fda or that any nda will be approved 
the following table sets forth the status of  and costs attributable to  our proprietary research and clinical development programs 
research and development projects and expenses three months ended fiscal year ended inception estimated september  september  through cost to september  complete project company funded projects develop neurodex for fda marketing approval in treating pba

estimated timing to complete phase iia and license the product up to years m preclinical atherosclerosis research program 
estimated timing to complete proof of concept and to license the product up to years m preclinical anti inflammatory research program mif inhibitor 
estimated timing to complete phase iia and to license the product up to years 
m other projects involving monoclonal antibodies and docosanol government funded projects preclinical research  primarily for potential treatments for genital herpes  and anthrax 
estimated timing to complete the various projects varies from one to two years m total each project includes allocation of laboratory occupancy costs 
m refers to millions 
estimated costs and timing to complete the projects are subject to the availability of funds 
inception dates are on or after october   at which time we began identifying and tracking programs costs 
total expenditures of million include an additional million in calendar year to complete the open label study and pay for the nda submission fee 

table of contents licensing and co promotion alternatives are being explored whereby a partner would fund a portion of clinical development 
see research and development program status and plans 
program expenditures for neurodex for the treatment of neuropathic pain during each of the listed periods include allocated costs of certain research projects that are shared with neurodex for pba 
we are in the process of developing our phase iii clinical study plan and estimated costs could change substantially 
includes a non cash charge of  related to the issuance of class a common stock in connection with the mif inhibitor technology see note  summary of significant accounting policies research and development expense in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
the costs and timing to complete these projects are unpredictable because of the uncertainty of outcomes of the research 
represents the remaining balance of state and federal research grant awards totaling  for research related to genital herpes and anthrax 
status of r d programs and plans company funded projects neurodex for the treatment of pba 
we intend to begin submission of an nda for neurodex tm to the fda by december  and we expect to complete its submission by mid the fda has offered a rolling review of the nda and has also indicated that neurodex would qualify for a priority review when the submission is complete 
the rolling review process will allow us to submit the nda in modules reviewable units  which can then be evaluated by the fda as they are submitted 
once the submission is complete  and assuming that the fda grants us priority review  it should take approximately six months for the fda to complete its review of the entire submission 
in june  we successfully completed the treatment phase of a phase iii clinical trial of neurodex for the treatment of pba in patients with ms 
also  avanir has been engaged in an open label safety study for the treatment of pba in a broader pool of patients who could have pba associated with one of several underlying neurodegenerative diseases or conditions 
prior to engaging in these recent and current ongoing studies  we successfully completed the initial phase iii clinical trial of pba in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis als  in may neurodex for the treatment of neuropathic pain 
we are currently developing our phase iii clinical development plan for the use of neurodex in the treatment of neuropathic pain and have included the costs to complete only one phase iii clinical trial 
simultaneously  we are evaluating commercial development alternatives  including continuing development on our own or with the funding of a potential co promotion partner or potential licensee 
in mid  we successfully completed a four week open label dose escalation study of neurodex in patients with painful diabetic neuropathy 
there can be no assurances as to the timing of a license or co promotion arrangement  if any 
development program for allergy and asthma ige regulator 
in fiscal we completed a phase i clinical trial of our asthma allergy drug  avp  in healthy volunteers 
the placebo controlled study was intended to assess safety  tolerability and pharmacokinetics following single rising oral doses 
results of the study suggest avp was well tolerated at all doses up through milligrams 
the study also demonstrated avp was detectable in the bloodstream at all doses administered and remains in circulation long enough to allow potentially once or twice daily dosing 
we intend to continue to evaluate the safety of the drug by conducting rising multi dose studies in healthy patients in fiscal assuming the successful completion of phase i clinical trials and adequate funds to continue development without a partner  we intend to continue development of the drug through phase iia 
assuming the results of such additional studies are favorable  we will seek to license the drug to a larger pharmaceutical company for further development 
development program for atherosclerosis 
we are engaged in preclinical research evaluating certain small  orally active molecules as a potential treatment of atherosclerosis the build up of fatty plaques in blood vessel walls 
our research is focused on developing molecules that can enhance the naturally occurring 
table of contents process known as reverse cholesterol transport rct  whereby cholesterol is effluxed from the fatty plaques in blood vessel walls and transported to the liver for elimination from the body 
preliminary studies in animal models suggest our compounds may both reduce fatty plaques and increase fecal cholesterol excretion 
anti inflammatory research program mif inhibitor 
we are currently conducting research on several potential drug candidates capable of inhibiting or blocking the activity of macrophage migration inhibitory factor mif  a protein thought to play a central role in the early stages of development of several inflammatory diseases 
our research indicates that mif may serve as a potential drug target in a variety of diseases  including rheumatoid arthritis  crohn s disease  ulcerative colitis  sepsis  glomerulonephritis  and asthma 
assuming we are successful in finding a lead compound and submitting an ind to the fda  and successfully complete some of the initial studies  we intend to license the compound to another pharmaceutical company for further development 
any delays to our product development timeline or in submitting an ind could cause a similar delay in the timing of when we expect that we could license our mif technology 
avanir acquired the rights to the mif inhibitor technology from the ciblex corporation in august on the basis that the technology could assist us in discovering a small molecule drug capable of regulating mif 
the mif inhibitor technology included several compounds  details of their chemical structures and method of preparation  data from in vitro experiments and in vivo test models  and rights to provisional patent applications filed by ciblex regarding use of those or similar compounds in the treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases 
in august  we charged  to research and development expense for the mif inhibitor program  representing the cost of issuing common stock to ciblex  in lieu of potential future milestones that would have likely been due in the future under the technology acquisition agreement  assuming continued successful development 
per the august amendment to the ciblex technology acquisition agreement the amendment  we will no longer be obligated to make up to million in milestone payments to ciblex upon the occurrence of certain events relating to the clinical development and or commercialization of the mif inhibitor technology in the united states  nor will we be obligated to share the receipt of other milestone payments outside the united states 
we will  however  be required to pay a royalty to ciblex if and when commercial sales under the agreement commence 
in connection with entering into the amendment  we issued ciblex  shares of class a common stock valued at  see note  shareholders equity common stock in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements and charged that amount to r d expense 
we believe that our continued research in this area likely would have resulted in the payment of one or more milestones to ciblex 
it is for that reason that avanir entered into the amendment 
as of the date of the amendment  the mif inhibitor technology was in the preclinical stage of development at avanir  but considerably further along than it was in august when we entered into the technology acquisition agreement 
there can be no assurance that any of the milestones under the technology acquisition agreement would have ever been reached or a payment made 
status of r d programs and plans government funded projects government research grants have helped fund research on docosanol based formulations for the treatment of genital herpes and the development of antibodies to anthrax toxins  among other research programs 
approximately  in funds remains to be spent for the remainder of and in under existing government research grants 
monoclonal antibodies anthrax toxin 
two of avanir s most potent anthrax antibodies  avp d and avp g  appear unique both in mechanism of action and in terms of the binding site on the anthrax toxin 
avp d is currently in preclinical development for use as a prophylactic and therapeutic drug to treat anthrax infections 
ultimately  avanir intends to submit an ind application seeking clearance from the fda to begin clinical trials to evaluate the safety  tolerability  and pharmacology of avp d in healthy human subjects 
much of our work targeting infectious diseases has been funded by government research grants 
because all of our research is at a very early preclinical stage of development and is unpredictable in terms of the outcome  we are unable to predict the cost and timing for development of any antibody or drug 

table of contents other government funded research 
during fiscal  we completed two government funded research programs the development of a blood donor program intended to find high affinity antibodies to infectious diseases and research on potential antibodies to cytomegalovirus and continued to make progress in developing antibodies to the anthrax toxin 
general and administrative expenses 
our general and administrative expenses increased to million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal these increased expenses primarily relate to a  increase related to human resources  employee training  and other company wide employee programs  a  increase related to legal and other professional services associated with corporate governance and compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of  and a  increase in building occupancy costs  primarily resulting from the utilization of additional office space in fiscal these increases were partially offset by a  reduction in outside services for investor relations 
we expect that costs associated with compliance with the sarbanes oxley act will continue to increase 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million in fiscal  compared to million during fiscal higher expenses in fiscal were related to the continued expansion of our medical education and awareness programs for pba  market research  and pre launch planning activities for neurodex 
we expect sales and marketing expenses will increase from of our operating expenses in fiscal to in fiscal as we continue to increase activities in preparation for a potential launch of neurodex  assuming the fda approves neurodex 
net loss vs 
for fiscal  the net loss attributable to common shareholders was million  or per share  compared to million  or per share in fiscal a higher average number of shares was outstanding in fiscal we expect to continue to pursue our drug development strategy focused on the development of neurodex  followed by other programs in earlier stages of development that are in large therapeutic areas and that have significant partnering and licensing potential 
to help fund and develop our products  we are evaluating potential alternative licensees and partners to share the costs of development 
some of these potential license arrangements could materially change our outlook for future revenues and costs 
however  the timing of such potential arrangements is unpredictable 
to reach the stage of partnering or licensing our product candidates or technologies or marketing our own products  we expect to continue to invest primarily in our clinical development programs  which we expect will contribute to a loss for fiscal comparison of fiscal and revenues vs 
revenues in fiscal amounted to million  compared to million in fiscal revenues for fiscal included million in revenues that the company recognized from the sale of abreva royalty rights to drug royalty usa and  from government research grants 
revenues for fiscal included a final million milestone payment relating to the one year anniversary of abreva product launch  million in royalty revenues on abreva product sales   in research contracts and license fees   in federal and state grant revenues  and  in sales of the active ingredient docosanol 
expenses vs 
operating expenses 
our total operating expenses increased to million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal the increase in operating expenses was primarily caused by a increase in spending on research and development programs

general and administrative expenses accounted for and of total operating expenses for fiscal and  respectively 
sales and marketing expenses accounted for and of total operating expenses for fiscal and  respectively 
these and other costs are more fully described below 
research and development expenses 
r d expenses totaled million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal we had four clinical trials and studies under way throughout most of fiscal  compared to only one clinical trial in fiscal the phase iii clinical trial and open label study of neurodex in the treatment of pba accounted for million  or  of total r d spending 
completion of toxicology  submitting an investigational new drug ind application to the fda  and completion of the initial dose levels in phase i clinical trials of our lead compound for the treatment of allergy and asthma accounted for million  or  of total r d spending 
an additional of r d spending was devoted to the development of neurodex in the treatment of neuropathic pain  in phase ii clinical development at that time 
approximately of spending was focused on research on a group of compounds targeting mif as a potential treatment for inflammatory diseases 
in fiscal  preclinical research focused on a novel treatment for allergy and asthma  including toxicology studies  scaled up manufacture of the lead compound  development of second generation compounds  and other related contract research  accounted for of total r d spending 
also in fiscal  clinical development of neurodex for the treatment of pba  including a phase iii clinical trial in patients with lou gehrig s disease  accounted for of r d spending 
r d related to the treatment of neuropathic pain and research on candidates for regulating mif each accounted for of total r d spending 
the balance of r d activities in both fiscal and was primarily related to other preclinical programs addressing cholesterol reduction and programs funded by government research grants 
general and administrative expenses 
our general and administrative expenses increased slightly to million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal these increased expenses primarily relate to a  increase in building occupancy costs  including utilities  maintenance and insurance resulting from the increase in usable office space  which amounted to  square feet in fiscal  compared to  square feet in fiscal  and increased legal and consulting costs relating to compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of and related rules and regulations 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million in fiscal  compared to million during fiscal higher expenses in fiscal were related to market research and planning and preparation for product launch of neurodex for the treatment of pba 
fiscal expenses included legal  travel and consulting costs related to out licensing docosanol cream in europe and the middle east  establishing business relations in the people s republic of china  and additional licensing and other commercial development activities related to marketing our antibody generation services

management outlook the substantial progress in research programs in fiscal has set the stage for continued development of all of our programs in fiscal  including the anticipated submission of an nda for neurodex in the treatment of pba 
we believe that cash  cash equivalents  and investments in securities totaling million at september   the december financing  plus anticipated future revenues  should be sufficient to sustain our planned level of operations for at least the next months 
however  to continue to fund the development of our new drug candidates and technology platforms and potential product launch of neurodex during the next two years assuming that neurodex is approved for marketing by the fda  we expect to continue to pursue various alternatives for raising capital during this two year period 
potential alternatives that we are considering for raising capital include  but are not limited to  partnering arrangements where partners share development costs  issuance of debt or equity securities  and licensing or sales of one or more of our platform technologies or new drug candidates

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as described below  we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
because substantially all our revenue  expenses  and capital purchasing activities are transacted in us dollars  our exposure to foreign currency exchange rates is immaterial 
however  in the future we could face increasing exposure to foreign currency exchange rates as we expand international distribution of docosanol cream and purchase additional services from outside the us until such time as we are faced with material amounts of foreign currency exchange rate risks  we do not plan to use derivative financial instruments  which can be used to hedge such risks 
we will evaluate the use of derivative financial instruments to hedge our exposures as the needs and risks should arise 
interest rate sensitivity our investment portfolio consists primarily of fixed income instruments with an average duration of years as of september  years as of september  
the primary objective of our investments in debt securities is to preserve principal while achieving attractive yields  without significantly increasing risk 
we classify our investments in securities as of september  as available for sale and our restricted investments in securities as held to maturity 
these available for sale securities are subject to interest rate risk 
in general  we would expect that the volatility of this portfolio would decrease as its duration decreases
