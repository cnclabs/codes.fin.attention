item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation introduction wps resources corporation wps resources corporation is a holding company which is exempt from the public utility holding company act of our wholly owned subsidiaries include two regulated utilities  wisconsin public service corporation which is an operating entity as well as a holding company exempt from the public utility holding company act of and upper peninsula power company 
another wholly owned subsidiary  wps resources capital corporation  is a holding company for our nonregulated businesses  including wps energy services  inc and wps power development  inc 
our regulated and nonregulated businesses have distinct competencies and business strategies  offer differing products and services  experience a wide array of risks and challenges  and are viewed uniquely by management 
the following summary provides insight into the operations of our subsidiaries 
regulated utilities our regulated utilities include wisconsin public service and upper peninsula power 
wisconsin public service derives its revenues primarily from servicing retail electric and natural gas customers in northeastern and central wisconsin and an adjacent portion of upper michigan 
wisconsin public service also provides wholesale electric service to various customers  including municipal utilities  electric cooperatives  energy marketers  other investor owned utilities  and a municipal joint action agency 
upper peninsula power derives revenues from the sale of electric energy in the upper peninsula of michigan 
the ability of our regulated utilities to earn their approved return on equity is dependent upon accurate budgeting and forecasting techniques  our ability to obtain timely rate increases to account for rising cost structures  minimizing the required rate increases in order to maintain the competitiveness of our core industrial customer base and keep these customers in our service area  and certain conditions that are outside of our control  such as macroeconomic factors and weather conditions 
an approximately three month delay in receiving retail electric rate relief played a significant role in wisconsin public service not earning its approved return on equity in as a result of this delay  we met with the public service commission of wisconsin and established procedures and fixed timelines for completion of the rate case in order to allow the public service commission of wisconsin to rule on a more timely basis 
these efforts led to a timely rate order for even with the higher retail electric rates  wisconsin public service s overall electric rates are among the lowest when compared to other investor owned utilities in wisconsin and across the nation 
the approved returns on equity for wisconsin public service and upper peninsula are and  respectively 
perhaps the most relevant risk to our regulated utilities is deregulation 
deregulation of the electric and natural gas utilities has begun in wisconsin  especially for natural gas service 
currently  the largest natural gas customers can purchase natural gas from suppliers other than their local utility 
efforts are underway to make it easier for smaller natural gas customers to do the same 
in addition  the public service commission of wisconsin has been studying how to deregulate the state s electric supply 
we believe electric deregulation inside wisconsin is at least several years off as the state is focused on improving reliability by building more generation and transmission facilities and creating fair market rules 
as electric choice occurs  we believe we will lose some generation load but will retain the delivery revenues and margin 
also  the capacity that is freed up should be competitive in our marketplace 
deregulation of electricity is present in michigan  however  no customers have chosen an alternative electric supplier and no alternative electric suppliers have offered to serve any customers in michigan s upper peninsula due to the lack of transmission capacity in the areas we serve in the upper peninsula  which is a barrier to competitive suppliers entering the market 
wps power development wps power development competes in the wholesale merchant electric power generation industry  primarily in the midwest and northeastern united states and adjacent portions of canada 
wps power development s core competencies include power plant operation and maintenance  waste disposal  and material condition assessment of assets 
revenues are derived primarily through the sale of capacity and energy generated from plant assets through wholesale outtake contracts and into liquid financial markets  primarily the pjm pennsylvania  new jersey and maryland  new york  and nepool new england power pool markets  at spot prices or day ahead prices 
historically  risk management activities have not been utilized significantly at wps power development 
excluding discontinued operations the operation of the sunbury generation plant  which is pending sale  and certain other related assets  wps power development has approximately megawatts of existing capacity  with fixed price contracts in place to sell approximately megawatts 
the majority of the remaining megawatts of generation have been leased to wps energy services under an operating lease effective january  as discussed in more detail below 
wps power development  through its subsidiary eco coal pelletization llc  also owns an interest in a synthetic fuel producing facility 
see trends wps resources  synthetic fuel operation for more information 
wps power development s ability to generate revenues is dependent upon open access to physical markets and liquid financial markets 
we are not currently aware of any significant changes in the physical markets in which wps power development operates 
in addition  we believe that financial markets are becoming more liquid with the addition of large financial players 
wps power development is subject to clean air regulations enforced by the united states environmental protection agency and state and local governments 
new legislation could require significant capital outlays that may impact wps power development s ability to compete with regulated utilities  which are allowed recovery of these costs 
oversupply of capacity  low spark spreads spark spread is the difference between the market price of electricity and its cost of production  and extreme volatility in the price of fuel  energy  and capacity values have negatively impacted margins at wps power development 
in response to these market conditions  wps power development has taken steps to adjust to the current wholesale merchant environment 
wps power development has instituted workforce reductions at the central office and at various new york and pennsylvania plants 
on october   a definitive agreement was entered into to sell wps power development s sunbury generating facility to a subsidiary of duquesne light holdings 
the pending sale of sunbury will allow wps power development to reduce uncontracted merchant exposure and redeploy capital into markets with different risk profiles 
in addition  in january  wps power development entered into operating lease agreements with wps energy services as part of its asset management strategy 
this partnership will enable wps power development to focus on efficient and effective operation of its plants and is expected to reduce market price risks associated with the merchant generation plants by utilizing wps energy services financial and physical product trading expertise 
wps energy services will utilize various financial tools  including forwards and options  to limit exposure  as well as to extract additional value from volatile commodity prices 
given current market conditions  we do not expect to see significant growth through the acquisition of generation assets  but we are continuing to look for growth opportunities that will allow us to extract synergies between wps power development and wps energy services that will enhance shareholder value 
wps energy services wps energy services offers nonregulated natural gas  electric  and alternate fuel supplies  as well as energy management and consulting services  to retail and wholesale customers primarily in the northeastern quadrant of the united states and adjacent portions of canada 
although wps energy services has a widening array of products and services  revenues are primarily derived through sales of electricity and natural gas 
wps energy services marketing and trading operations manage power and natural gas procurement as an integrated portfolio with its retail and wholesale sales commitments 
in  wps energy services purchased electricity required to fulfill these sales commitments primarily from independent generators  energy marketers  and organized electric power markets and purchased natural gas from a variety of suppliers under daily  monthly  seasonal  and long term contracts  with pricing delivery and volume schedules to accommodate customer requirements 
wps energy services customers include utilities  municipalities  cooperatives  commercial and industrial consumers  aggregators  and other marketing and retail entities 
wps energy services uses derivative financial instruments to provide flexible pricing to customers and suppliers  manage purchase and sales commitments  and reduce exposure relative to the volatility of market prices 
the table below discloses future natural gas and electric sales volumes under contract as of december  contracts are generally one to three years in duration 
wps energy services expects that its ultimate sales volumes in and beyond will exceed the volumes shown in the table below as it continues to seek growth opportunities 
forward contracted volumes at to to wholesale sales volumes billion cubic feet retail sales volumes billion cubic feet total natural gas sales volumes wholesale sales volumes million kilowatt hours retail sales volumes million kilowatt hours total electric sales volumes for comparative purposes  future natural gas and electric sales volumes under contract at december  are shown below 
actual electric and natural gas sales volumes for are disclosed within results of operations wps resources corporation  wps energy services segment operations 
forward contracted volumes at to to wholesale sales volumes billion cubic feet retail sales volumes billion cubic feet total natural gas sales volumes wholesale sales volumes million kilowatt hours retail sales volumes million kilowatt hours total electric sales volumes these tables represent physical sales contracts for natural gas and electric power for delivery or settlement in future periods 
management has no reason to believe that gross margins that will be generated by these contracts will vary significantly from those experienced historically 
wps energy services acquired retail electric operations in michigan in prior to the acquisition  this operation was an electric wholesale customer of wps energy services  therefore forward contracted volumes to this customer at december  were included in wholesale sales volumes 
at december  forward contracted volumes related to this operation were included in retail sales volumes 
wps energy services has experienced steady increases in electric and natural gas sales volumes since its inception  and expects this trend to continue as it continues to look for opportunities that fit within its growth strategy 
in  wps energy services grew its retail electric business through the acquisition of retail operations in michigan and participation in the new jersey basic generation service program 
natural gas volumes increased as a result of the expansion of its retail natural gas business in canada 
wps energy services expects to continue to target acquisitions and participate in generation service programs within the area it serves 
although revenues are expected to grow in  we do not anticipate earnings growth in since growth included the favorable settlement of several counterparty liabilities and the cumulative effect of a change in accounting arising from the required adoption of emerging issues task force issue no 
 issues involved in energy trading and risk management activities  with requirements that shifted margin recognition from to we anticipate long term earnings growth at wps energy services in the range of to 
as a company that participates in energy commodity markets  wps energy services is exposed to a variety of risks  including market  operational  liquidity  and credit risks 
market risk is measured as the potential gain or loss of a portfolio that is associated with a price movement within a given probability over a specific period of time  known as value at risk 
through the use of derivative financial instruments  we believe we have reduced our value at risk to acceptable levels 
operational risk is the risk of loss from less than flawless execution of transactions  forecasting  scheduling  or other operational activities and is common to all companies participating in the energy marketing industry 
wps energy services continued investment in computational infrastructure  business process improvement  employee training  and internal controls has helped mitigate operational risk to date 
liquidity risk is an emerging risk  and one that has historically been less applicable to wps energy services than many industry participants because of the financial support provided by wps resources in the form of guarantees to counterparties 
a significant downgrade in wps resources credit ratings  however  could cause counterparties to demand additional assurances of payment 
wps resources board of directors imposes restrictions on the amount of guarantees wps resources is allowed to provide to these counterparties in order to protect its credit ratings  and wps energy services believes it would have adequate capital to continue core operations unless wps resources credit ratings fell below investment grade standard poor s rating of bbb moody s rating of baa 
the other category of risk mentioned above that wps energy services faces is credit risk from retail and wholesale counterparties 
in order to mitigate its exposure to credit risk  wps energy services has implemented stringent credit policies 
as a result of these credit policies  wps energy services has not experienced significant write offs from its large wholesale counterparties to date 
write offs pertaining to retail counterparties were million in  or  and we believe this write off percentage is within the range experienced by most energy companies 
the table below summarizes wholesale counterparty credit exposure  categorized by maturity date  as of december  in millions counterparty rating exposure exposure less than year exposure to years net exposure of counterparties greater than of net exposure investment grade regulated utility investment grade other non investment grade regulated utility non investment grade other non rated regulated utility non rated other total exposure the investment and non investment grade categories are determined by publicly available credit ratings of the counterparty or the rating of any guarantor  whichever is higher 
investment grade counterparties are those with a senior unsecured moody s rating of baa or above or a standard poor s rating of bbb or above 
exposure considers netting of accounts receivable and accounts payable where netting agreements are in place as well as netting mark to market exposure 
exposure is before consideration of collateral from counterparties 
collateral  in the form of cash and letters of credit  received from counterparties totaled million at december   all from non rated counterparties 
as discussed above  wps energy services is aiding wps power development with its asset management  starting in january over the past year  wps energy services has positioned itself to mitigate price risks and optimize the market value associated with wps power development s merchant generation facilities 
wps energy services expects to employ a variety of physical and financial instruments offered in the marketplace to limit risk exposure associated with fluctuating commodity prices and volumes  enhance value  and minimize cash flow volatility 
while risks associated with the power generating capacity  retail electric  and natural gas sales will be commercially hedged  generally accepted accounting principles related to recognition of changes in the fair value of derivative instruments as represented in statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended and interpreted and emerging issues task force issue no 
 issues involved in accounting for derivative contracts held for trading purposes and contracts involved in energy trading and risk management activities  will preclude a perfect matching of gains and losses from the generating capacity with the physical and financial hedging instruments in some reporting periods 
the result could cause volatility in the reported earnings of wps energy services 
however  the financial impact of this timing difference would be reversed at the time of physical delivery and or settlement of the transactions 
wps energy services is also impacted by earnings volatility associated with the natural gas storage cycle  which runs annually from june to march 
injections of natural gas into inventory take place in the summer and natural gas is withdrawn in the winter months 
wps energy services policy is to hedge the price risk of all purchases for storage with sales in the over the counter and futures markets  eliminating the price risk for the storage assets 
current accounting rules allow for the marking to market of forward sales  but do not allow for the marking to market of the related gas inventory 
this results in gains and losses that are recognized in different interim periods  but even out by the end of the storage cycle 
at december  there were pre tax mark to market losses of million recorded related to the natural gas storage cycle that are expected to reverse in the first quarter of results of operations wps resources corporation compared with wps resources corporation overview wps resources and results of operations are shown in the following table wps resources results millions  except share amounts change consolidated operating revenues income available for common shareholders basic earnings per share diluted earnings per share total revenues increased significantly due to the required reclassification of previously reported revenues and cost of sales see wps energy services segment operations below for further information 
total revenues also increased due to sales volume growth at wps energy services  electric utility rate increases  and higher natural gas prices 
the decrease in basic earnings per share in compared to was largely driven by an million decrease in after tax gains recognized from sales of portions of our interest in a synthetic fuel operation  a million increase in losses from discontinued operations  and a million reduction in tax credits recognized from the synthetic fuel operation 
these decreases were partially offset by an million  or  increase in income available for common shareholders at wps energy services 
strategic acquisitions  customer growth  and favorable settlement of certain counterparty liabilities contributed to wps energy services increased earnings 
also impacting basic earnings per share was an increase of million in the weighted average number of outstanding shares of wps resources common stock in compared to the increase was largely due to issuing  additional shares through a public offering in november additional shares were also issued in under the stock investment plan 
overview of utility operations utility operations include the electric utility segment consisting of the electric operations of wisconsin public service and upper peninsula power and the gas utility segment comprising the natural gas operations at wisconsin public service 
income available for common shareholders attributable to the electric utility segment was million in compared to million in income available for common shareholders attributable to the gas utility segment was million in compared to million in electric utility segment operations wps resources electric utility segment results millions change revenues fuel and purchased power costs margins sales in kilowatt hours electric utility segment revenues increased million  or  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the increase is largely due to retail and wholesale electric rate increases for our wisconsin and michigan customers in accordance with new rate orders 
wisconsin public service was granted authority to increase retail electric rates  effective march   by the public service commission of wisconsin 
wisconsin public service was granted authority for a million increase in retail electric rates from the michigan public service commission  effective july  the michigan public service commission also authorized recovery of million of increased transmission costs through the power supply cost recovery fuel adjustment clause 
in addition  the federal energy regulatory commission ordered a interim increase in wholesale electric rates for wisconsin public service effective may   subject to refund to the extent final rates are lower final rates are anticipated in the second quarter of 
upper peninsula power was granted authority to increase retail electric rates by  effective december   by the michigan public service commission 
the electric utility margin increased million  or  in compared to due primarily to the electric rate increases mentioned above  electric margins at wisconsin public service increased million  or 
electric margins at wisconsin public service were also impacted favorably by a change in sales mix in while total sales volumes remained basically unchanged in compared to  sales volumes to higher margin residential  and commercial and industrial customers increased slightly 
the increase in sales volumes to these higher margin customer classes reflects growth within wisconsin public service s service area and recent changes in the economy 
these increases were partially offset by cooler weather during the cooling season for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  electric margins at upper peninsula power increased million  or  due primarily to the retail electric rate increase mentioned above  partially offset by a decrease in sales volumes 
the decrease in sales volumes can be attributed to less favorable weather conditions for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   and customer conservation of electricity made necessary due to a flood that occurred earlier in although the electric utility margin increased  electric utility segment earnings for the year ended december  decreased million compared to the year ended december  the primary reason for the decrease in electric utility segment earnings is due to a decrease in earnings at wisconsin public service attributed to a delay in receiving retail electric rate relief  together with rising operating expenses primarily pension and medical costs 
rate relief for our increasing operating costs was expected on january   however  the increase in retail electric rates granted by the public service commission of wisconsin was not effective until march  the delay in receiving rate relief was a significant factor in our inability to achieve our authorized return on equity in the decrease in earnings experienced by wisconsin public service was partially offset by a modest increase in earnings at upper peninsula power company due to the increase in rates 
the public service commission of wisconsin allows wisconsin public service to adjust prospectively the amount billed to wisconsin retail customers for fuel and purchased power if costs fall outside a specified range 
wisconsin public service is required to file an application to adjust rates either higher or lower when costs are plus or minus from forecasted costs on an annualized basis 
see liquidity and capital resources wps resources  other future considerations  regulatory for information on fuel filings related to gas utility segment operations wps resources gas utility segment results millions change revenues purchase costs margins throughput in therms gas utility segment revenues increased million  or  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the increase in gas utility revenues is mostly due to a increase in the average cost of natural gas for the year ended december  compared to the prior year  partially offset by the decrease in retail natural gas rates ordered by the public service commission of wisconsin  effective march the natural gas utility margin for the year ended december  increased million  or  compared to the year ended december  the increase in the natural gas utility margin can be attributed to a increase in natural gas throughput volumes in compared to natural gas throughput volumes to our higher margin residential and commercial and industrial customers increased in the aggregate  mostly as a result of colder weather in compared to natural gas throughput volumes to our lower margin transport customers decreased due to the rising price of natural gas together with their ability to use alternate fuel sources 
despite the modest increase in gas utility margins  gas utility earnings for the year ended december  decreased million compared to the decline is primarily due to rising operating expenses primarily pension and medical costs together with the decrease in natural gas rates mentioned above 
wisconsin public service passes changes in the total cost of gas on to customers through a purchased gas adjustment clause  as allowed by the public service commission of wisconsin and the michigan public service commission under regulatory practice 
overview of nonregulated operations nonregulated operations consist of natural gas  electric  and other sales at wps energy services  a diversified energy supply and services company  and the operations of wps power development  an electric generation company 
wps energy services and wps power development are both reportable segments 
wps energy services income available for common shareholders increased to million in compared with million in  primarily as a result of increased electric and natural gas margins discussed below 
wps power development recognized a net loss of million in compared to income available for common shareholders of million in despite an increase in margins  wps power development s earnings were impacted by a decrease in gains recognized from the sale of portions of its interest in a synthetic fuel operation  increased losses from discontinued operations  and a decrease in the amount of tax credits recognized 
wps energy services segment operations total segment revenues at wps energy services were  million in compared to million in the total margin at wps energy services was million in compared to million in wps energy services nonregulated natural gas and electric operations are the primary contributors to revenues and margins and are discussed below 
wps energy services natural gas results millions except sales volumes change nonregulated natural gas revenues nonregulated natural gas cost of sales margins wholesale sales volumes in billion cubic feet retail sales volumes in billion cubic feet represents gross physical volumes wps energy services nonregulated natural gas revenues increased  million for the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
approximately million of the increase relates to the required adoption of issue no 
 effective january  see trends wps resources for more information about this accounting change 
volume growth driven by the acquisition of a retail natural gas business in canada accounted for approximately million of the increase in revenues in most of the remaining increase can be attributed to higher natural gas prices compared to the prior year 
natural gas margins at wps energy services increased million  or  in compared to approximately million of the increase related to the november  acquisition of a retail natural gas business in canada 
the remaining increase related to favorable settlements of pending liabilities with several counterparties  partially offset by the change in accounting prescribed by the required adoption of issue see cumulative effect of change in accounting principles below for further discussion 
wps energy services electric results millions change nonregulated electric revenues nonregulated electric cost of sales margins wholesale sales in kilowatt hours retail sales in kilowatt hours represents gross physical volumes wps energy services nonregulated electric revenues increased million for the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
approximately million of the increase relates to the required adoption of issue another million of the increase can be attributed to participation in the new jersey basic generation services program 
wps energy services acquired megawatts of fixed price load and megawatts of variable priced load for the period from august  to may  as a result of its participation in this program 
the remaining increase in nonregulated electric revenues can be attributed to increased prices and expansion within existing service territories 
wps energy services also acquired retail electric operations in michigan in prior to the acquisition  this operation was an electric wholesale customer of wps energy services  therefore the acquisition did not have a significant impact on total revenues in compared to the acquisition did  however account for most of the increase in retail sales volumes and related decrease in wholesale sales volumes in compared to wps energy services electric margin increased million  or  in compared to approximately million of the increase is due to acquisition synergies and improved management of retail operations in michigan and participation in the new jersey basic generation service program 
the remaining increase in wps energy services electric margins is largely due to the impact of the change in accounting prescribed by the required adoption of issue  which precludes mark to market accounting for nonderivative trading contracts 
wps power development s segment operations all revenues and costs of wps power development s discontinued operations are combined and reported on a net basis in the wps resources corporation consolidated statements of income for all periods presented 
accordingly  the table below does not include the results of discontinued operations  which are discussed separately within discontinued operations below 
wps power development s production results millions change nonregulated other revenues nonregulated other cost of sales margins wps power development s revenues increased million  or  in compared to wps power development s margin increased million  or  in compared to the increase in revenues and margin was primarily the result of increased generation from generating assets acquired in new york on june   revenues from the combined locks energy center that became fully operational in the second quarter of  and an increase in generation at the hydroelectric plants in maine and canada as a result of increased rainfall  higher capacity revenues  and increased pricing on a renegotiated outtake contract 
partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in revenues and margins at wps power development s cassville  wisconsin  facility as a result of the expiration of an energy and capacity outtake contract that was not renewed 
overview of holding company and other segment operations holding company and other operations include the operations of wps resources and wps resources capital as holding companies and the nonutility activities at wisconsin public service and upper peninsula power 
holding company and other operations experienced a net loss of million in compared to a net loss of million in the decrease in the net loss experienced is largely related to an increase in gains recognized on hydroelectric land sales in compared to recorded as a component of miscellaneous income  primarily due to a million pre tax gain recognized in from land sales to the wisconsin department of natural resources 
the sale of these hydroelectric lands is part of our asset management strategy  which was initiated in  and is intended to optimize shareholder return from the sale  development  or use of certain assets or entire business units 
operating expenses wps resources operating expenses millions change operating and maintenance expense depreciation and decommissioning expense taxes other than income operating and maintenance expense operating expenses increased million  or  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  utility operating expenses increased million  or  in compared to approximately million of the increase reflects higher pension  postretirement medical  and active medical costs 
the remaining increase pertains to costs incurred for plant maintenance related to the kewaunee nuclear power plant s scheduled refueling outage in there was no refueling outage in  additional operating expenses at the kewaunee nuclear power plant  and wage increases 
operating expenses at wps energy services increased million  or  in compared to  largely due to costs associated with business expansion  including the acquisition of a retail natural gas business in canada and a retail electric business in michigan 
the remaining increase is largely due to higher incentive compensation costs and the costs associated with a full year of operation of generation assets in new york that were purchased by wps power development in june depreciation and decommissioning expense depreciation and decommissioning expense increased million  or  due primarily to an increase of million resulting from increased realized gains on the decommissioning trust assets that resulted in recording decommissioning expense approximately equal to the gains recognized in miscellaneous income pursuant to regulatory practice 
the increase in realized gains is due primarily to the change in investment strategy for wisconsin public service s qualified nuclear decommissioning trust assets 
qualified decommissioning trust assets were transferred to more conservative investments in pending the sale of the kewaunee nuclear power plant  thus triggering realized gains 
most of the remaining increase resulted from plant asset additions at wisconsin public service and wps power development 
taxes other than income taxes other than income increased million  or  primarily due to an increase in gross receipts taxes paid by wisconsin public service as a result of increased revenues 
other income expense wps resources other income expense millions change miscellaneous income interest expense and distributions of preferred securities minority interest other income expense miscellaneous income miscellaneous income increased million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the increase in miscellaneous income is largely due to an increase in realized gains on the decommissioning trust assets of million  which is primarily the result of the change in investment strategy for the qualified nuclear decommissioning trust assets 
the realized gains were offset by increased decommissioning expense  as discussed above 
miscellaneous income also increased million as a result of the sale of land to the wisconsin department of natural resources and million resulting from an increase in earnings from equity investments 
the increases in miscellaneous income were partially offset by lower gains from sales of ownership interests in wps power development s synthetic fuel operation 
wps power development recognized a million pre tax gain in compared with a million pre tax gain in related to these sell downs 
an increase in operating losses generated by the synthetic fuel operation due to increased production decreased miscellaneous income by approximately million in the increased operating losses were driven by our partner s ability to utilize tax credits in and were offset by minority interest  which is discussed below 
in the aggregate  the items mentioned above relating to the synthetic fuel operation resulted in a million decrease in miscellaneous income 
the gain resulted from the sale of a portion of wps power development s interest in its synthetic fuel operation 
similar gains from the sale are expected to be recognized annually through  dependent upon production at the synthetic fuel facility 
the gain reported in resulted from a sell down of a portion of wps power development s interest in a synthetic fuel operation  which was recognized in its entirety by december  minority interest as a result of wps power development s sale of an approximate interest in its subsidiary  eco coal pelletization llc  on december   million of losses related to the synthetic fuel operation and reported in miscellaneous income were allocated to wps power development s partner and reported as a minority interest 
provision for income taxes the effective tax rate was in compared to in the increase in the effective tax rate in compared to is largely due to a decrease in tax credits that could be recognized from our ownership interest in a synthetic fuel operation 
tax credits recognized during the year ended december  decreased million compared to the prior year  due to the sale of a portion of our interest in the synthetic fuel operation on december  lower taxable income in also reduced the amount of tax credits that could be claimed 
our ownership interest in the synthetic fuel operation resulted in the recognition of million of section tax credits as a reduction of federal income tax expense in compared to million in the operations of our synthetic fuel facility generate tax credits  which we use to reduce our current federal income tax liability  with any remaining credits increasing our alternative minimum tax credit available for future years 
the cumulative amount of credits carried forward at december  relating to our interest in the synthetic fuel facility was million 
based on a review of all known facts and circumstances  management has concluded that it is more likely than not that we will be able to use these credits in the future 
discontinued operations on october   a definitive agreement was entered into to sell wps power development s sunbury generation plant  subject to certain contingencies 
as a result of such agreement  we have determined that the operations of the plant and certain other related assets meet the definition of discontinued operations per the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the loss from discontinued operations increased to million million after taxes for the year ended december  from million million after taxes for the year ended december  the increased loss is largely due to a decrease in capacity sales in due to the expiration of a sales contract  an increase in variable production expenses related to increased emission costs  and an increase in operating costs 
operating costs increased in as a result of issues related to fuel quality and associated mechanical difficulties involving fuel delivery systems earlier in the year  operational issues related to newly installed environmental equipment in various boilers  and turbine outages 
the increase in the loss from discontinued operations was partially offset by decreases in payroll and employee benefits as a result of a restructuring that took place at the end of cumulative effect of change in accounting principles wps energy services had been applying the accounting standards of issue  accounting for contracts involved in energy trading and risk management activities  from the first quarter of until this standard was rescinded by issue in october wps energy services was defined as a trading company under issue and was required to mark all of its energy related contracts to market 
on october   the emerging issues task force rescinded issue  thus precluding mark to market accounting for energy trading contracts entered into after that date that are not derivatives and requiring a cumulative change in accounting principle to be recorded effective january  for all nonderivative contracts entered into on or prior to october  on january   wps resources recorded a positive after tax cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of million primarily related to the operations of wps energy services to income available for common shareholders to remove from its balance sheet the mark to market effects of those contracts entered into on or prior to october  that do not meet the definition of a derivative under statement no 
 as amended 
the cumulative effect of adopting this new accounting standard is expected to reverse upon the settlement of the contracts impacted by the standard 
most of these settlements are expected to occur in the required change in accounting had no impact on the underlying economics or cash flows of the contracts 
in addition  the adoption of statement no 
at wps power development resulted in a million cumulative effect of change in accounting principle related to the closure of an ash basin at the sunbury generating plant 
compared with wps resources corporation overview wps resources and results of operations are shown in the following table wps resources results millions  except share amounts change consolidated operating revenues income available for common shareholders basic earnings per share diluted earnings per share the increase in basic earnings per share in compared to was largely driven by a gain at wps power development related to the sale of part of its synthetic fuel operations 
the sale occurred in the fourth quarter of  and we deferred recognition of a portion of the related gain on the sale pending the satisfaction of certain contingencies 
in addition  wps energy services income available for common shareholders increased  primarily due to improved natural gas margins 
a full year contribution from gas utility operations acquired in the spring of  warmer than normal weather during the heating season in  and a rate increase approved by regulators resulted in increased earnings from our gas utility in also impacting basic earnings per share was an increase of million in the weighted average number of outstanding shares of wps resources common stock in compared to the increase was largely due to issuing million additional shares through a public offering in the fourth quarter of and issuing million shares in the merger of wisconsin fuel and light into wisconsin public service in the second quarter of additional shares were also issued in under the stock investment plan 
overview of utility operations income available for common shareholders attributable to electric utility operations was million in compared with million in income available for common shareholders attributable to gas utility operations was million in compared with million in utility margins at wisconsin public service were impacted positively by a public service commission of wisconsin interim rate order  which was effective january   authorizing a increase in wisconsin retail electric rates and a increase in wisconsin retail natural gas rates 
in late june  wisconsin public service received a final rate order that authorized a increase in wisconsin retail electric rates and a increase in wisconsin retail natural gas rates 
the final order authorized a lower retail natural gas rate increase than was approved in the interim order resulting in a million refund to wisconsin public service s natural gas customers 
electric utility segment operations our electric utility segment margin increased million  or  due to the wisconsin retail electric rate increases at wisconsin public service and higher overall electric utility sales volumes 
wps resources electric utility segment results millions change revenues fuel and purchased power costs margins sales in kilowatt hours our electric utility segment revenues increased million  or  in as the result of the electric rate increases and an increase in overall electric sales volumes at wisconsin public service 
sales volumes were up for lower margin  wholesale customers while sales to higher margin  residential customers increased and sales to higher margin  commercial and industrial customers increased 
summer weather was warmer in than in  and warmer than normal 
increased fuel costs for power generation were partially offset by lower purchased power expenses 
fuel expense for generation plants increased million  or  in purchased power expense  however  decreased million  or  in overall generation from wisconsin public service s plants increased while purchased volumes decreased 
the change in the energy supply mix was largely due to the availability of less expensive power generation from the kewaunee nuclear power plant 
wisconsin public service increased its ownership interest in the kewaunee nuclear power plant to in september although upper peninsula power s purchased volumes remained fairly consistent  the unit cost of its purchased power decreased 
as discussed previously  the public service commission of wisconsin allows wisconsin public service to adjust prospectively the amount billed to wisconsin retail customers for fuel and purchased power if costs fall outside a specified range 
wisconsin public service did not submit any fuel filings in gas utility segment operations effective april   the gas utility margin at wisconsin public service includes the merged wisconsin fuel and light company operations 
wps resources gas utility segment results millions change revenues purchase costs margins throughput in therms an increase in overall natural gas throughput volumes of and the wisconsin retail gas rate increase resulted in a higher gas utility margin of million  or  in increased overall gas throughput volumes were partially the result of including months of operations for former wisconsin fuel and light in compared with the inclusion of months of operations in gas throughput volumes were also affected by a heating season that was colder in than in  but milder than normal 
wisconsin public service s gas revenues decreased million  or  in and gas purchase costs decreased million  or  largely as the result of a decrease in the average unit cost of natural gas in overview of nonregulated operations wps energy services income available for common shareholders increased to million in compared with million in primarily due to a higher gas margin 
wps power development s income available for common shareholders increased to million in compared with million in largely due to recognition of a gain related to the sale of a portion of its synthetic fuel operations 
wps energy services segment operations revenues at wps energy services were million in compared with million in  an increase of 
the increase was primarily the result of higher retail natural gas sales volumes in wps energy services gas results millions except sales volumes change nonregulated natural gas revenues nonregulated natural gas cost of sales margins wholesale sales volumes in billion cubic feet retail sales volumes in billion cubic feet nonregulated gas revenues at wps energy services increased million  or  in primarily as the result of higher natural gas sales volumes in the nonregulated gas margin increased million  or  in due to improved management of the retail gas procurement and volume risk processes and increased retail sales volumes 
wps energy services electric results millions change nonregulated electric revenues nonregulated electric cost of sales margins wholesale sales in kilowatt hours retail sales in kilowatt hours nonregulated electric revenues at wps energy services increased million  or  in due to higher sales volumes 
the nonregulated electric margin decreased million  or  in primarily due to the slow economy which produced less favorable market conditions for opportunity sales in wps power development s segment operations wps power development s production results millions change nonregulated other revenues nonregulated other cost of sales margins revenues at wps power development were million in compared with million in  an increase of 
the increase was primarily due to the operation of the generation assets acquired in new york in the second quarter of and the operation of the combined locks energy center 
as new generation assets are acquired or constructed  wps power development s output is increased  providing new sales opportunities 
partially offsetting these increases were a change in accounting from consolidation to equity method accounting for wps power development s synthetic fuel operations and lower revenues from steam sales 
wps power development experienced an increase of million  or  in its margin in the operation of the generation assets acquired in new york and the startup of the combined locks energy center contributed to wps power development s higher margin in a change in accounting for wps power development s synthetic fuel operations also increased margins by approximately million 
as a result of the november sale of a portion of wps power development s synthetic fuel operations  wps power development no longer consolidates these operations as a part of revenue and cost of sales 
after the sell down  wps power development became a minority owner  and therefore accounts for its interest in the synthetic fuel operations under the equity method of accounting 
as a result of no longer consolidating the synthetic fuel operations  wps power development s margins increased because this business had negative margins in overview of holding company and other segment operations holding company and other operations experienced a net loss of million in compared with income available for common shareholders of million in a net loss was experienced in primarily due to interest expense from financing to provide funds for subsidiary operations 
hydro land sales  which are part of our asset management strategy  resulted in pretax gains of million in compared with pretax gains of approximately million in in addition  earnings on equity investments were higher in compared with primarily due to our investment in american transmission company 
operating expenses wps resources operating expenses millions change operating and maintenance expense depreciation and decommissioning expense taxes other than income operating and maintenance expense operating and maintenance expense increased million  or  for the year ended december  compared to utility operating and maintenance expense increased million in largely due to amortization of regulatory deferrals  increased benefit costs  higher transmission expenses associated with american transmission company  increased expenses at the kewaunee nuclear power plant as a result of wisconsin public service acquiring additional ownership interest in the plant  and increased energy conservation expenses 
operating and maintenance expenses at wps energy services increased million in  largely due to costs associated with business expansion and increased bad debt expense 
operating expenses at wps power development increased million in primarily due to costs associated with the generation assets in new york that were purchased by wps power development in june and operation of the combined locks energy center 
depreciation and decommissioning expense depreciation and decommissioning expense increased million  or  for the year ended december  compared to utility depreciation and decommissioning expense increased million in largely due to additional plant assets at wisconsin public service  including its increased ownership interest in the kewaunee nuclear power plant 
lower depreciation expense of million related to decreased decommissioning earnings partially offset the increased plant asset depreciation 
wps power development s depreciation expense increased million in due to additional plant assets  including the combined locks energy center and the assets obtained in the ch resources acquisition 
depreciation and decommissioning expense at wps energy services did not change significantly from the prior year 
taxes other than income taxes other than income increased million  or  primarily due to an increase in gross receipts taxes paid by wisconsin public service as a result of increased revenues 
other income expense wps resources other income expense millions change miscellaneous income interest expense and distributions of preferred securities other income expense miscellaneous income miscellaneous income increased million  or  in compared to wps power development s miscellaneous income increased million in primarily as the result of recognizing a pretax gain of million related to the sale of part of wps power development s synthetic fuel operations 
wps power development recognized a pretax gain of million on the sale in the fourth quarter of and deferred the remaining portion of the gain pending satisfaction of certain contingencies  including the receipt of a private letter ruling from the internal revenue service 
the contingencies were satisfied in and the remaining gain was recognized 
wps power development also recognized royalties of million in related to its synthetic fuel operations 
partially offsetting these factors were equity method losses for wps power development s synthetic fuel operations 
utility miscellaneous income decreased million in primarily as the result of lower earnings of million on wisconsin public service s nuclear decommissioning trust assets 
due to regulatory practice  a decrease in earnings on the trust assets is largely offset by decreased depreciation expense 
miscellaneous income related to holding company and other operations also decreased in compared to the decrease is largely due to a million decrease in gains realized from the sale of hydroelectric lands in  partially offset by increased earnings on equity investments due to the investment in american transmission company 
interest expense and distributions of preferred securities interest expense increased million  or  in compared to primarily due to the increase in the amount of long term debt 
provision for income taxes the effective tax rate was in compared to in the increase in the effective tax rate in compared to is largely due to a decrease in tax credits recognized from our ownership interest in a synthetic fuel operation 
we used tax credits to the extent the tax law permits to reduce our current federal income tax liability  with any remaining credits increasing our alternative minimum tax credit available for future years 
discontinued operations the after tax loss from discontinued operations decreased to million in from million in while we were able to improve the operating performance of our discontinued generation plant  market conditions for capacity in the area in which this plant participates continued to degrade  which resulted in continued losses 
balance sheet wps resources compared with accounts receivable  net of reserves  increased million  or  at december  compared to december  largely due to a million increase in wps energy services accounts receivable 
the increase in receivables at wps energy services is due to a significant increase in electric and natural gas sales volumes combined with significantly higher natural gas prices 
inventories increased million  or  at december  compared to december  inventories at wisconsin public service increased approximately million  or  in correlation with the increase in the average price of natural gas experienced by this business in wps energy services stored gas inventories increased approximately million  or  due to higher anticipated sales in the first quarter of compared to the first quarter of and increased natural gas prices 
current assets from risk management activities increased million  or  at december  compared to december   and current liabilities from risk management activities increased million  or 
long term assets from risk management activities decreased million  or  at december  compared to december  and long term liabilities from risk management activities decreased million  or 
these variances were largely due to changes in the forward price curve for natural gas and increased volumes 
property  plant  and equipment  net  increased million to  million at december  compared to  million at december  wps resources adopted statement no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  effective january  and as a result  capitalized a net asset retirement cost of million decreased to million at december  due to depreciation 
the remaining increase in property  plant  and equipment  net  primarily relates to capital expenditures at wisconsin public service for the pulliam combustion turbine and gas and electric distribution equipment 
the staff of the securities and exchange commission recently expressed their views on the balance sheet classification of costs of removal for the utility industry and required that the amounts be reclassified from accumulated depreciation to a liability 
as a result  wps resources reclassified costs of removal out of accumulated depreciation at december  and see trends wps resources for more information about these accounting changes 
other long term assets increased million  or  at december  compared to december  as a result of our investment in guardian pipeline  additional investments in american transmission company  and the recognition of an intangible pension asset related to the minimum pension liability we recorded at december  accounts payable increased million at december  compared to december  the accounts payable balance at wps energy services increased approximately million as a result of an increase in electric and natural gas purchases required to supply its larger customer base and the significant increase in natural gas prices compared to the prior year 
the increase experienced by wps energy services was partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable at wisconsin public service  largely due to a million payable that was recorded at december  resulting from the purchase of the de pere energy center 
this amount was paid in other current liabilities increased million  or  in largely due to an increase in customer prepayments experienced at wps energy services 
regulatory liabilities increased million at december  compared to december   largely due to the reclassification of million of non legal costs of removal from nuclear decommissioning and other cost of removal to regulatory liabilities 
most of the remaining increase relates to a regulatory liability that was recorded upon the adoption of statement no 
see trends wps resources for more information about this accounting change 
pension and postretirement benefit obligations increased million  or  at december  compared to december  due primarily to the minimum pension liability that was recorded at december  for our administrative pension plan  driven by a decrease in the discount rate used to value our obligation under this plan 
the million asset retirement obligation recorded at december  is related to a legal retirement obligation recorded as a result of our adoption of statement no 
for the decommissioning of the irradiated portions of the kewaunee nuclear power plant 
see trends wps resources for more information about this accounting change 
the million liability for nuclear decommissioning and other costs of removal at december  was reclassified from accumulated depreciation in accordance with recent views expressed by the staff of the securities and exchange commission for the utility industry 
historically  these costs of removal were reflected as a component of depreciation expense and accumulated depreciation in accordance with regulatory treatment 
upon adoption of statement no 
on january   costs of removal with associated legal obligations of million were removed from nuclear decommissioning and other costs of removal as these costs are now accounted for as asset retirement obligations 
at december   costs of removal without an associated legal obligation  as defined by statement no 
 were reclassified to a regulatory liability pursuant to statement no

liquidity and capital resources wps resources we believe that our cash balances  liquid assets  operating cash flows  access to equity capital markets and borrowing capacity made available because of strong credit ratings  when taken together  provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements and future capital expenditures related to expansion of existing businesses and development of new projects 
however  our operating cash flow and access to capital markets can be impacted by macroeconomic factors outside of our control 
in addition  our borrowing costs can be impacted by short and long term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies 
currently  we believe these ratings are among the best in the energy industry see financing cash flows  credit ratings below 
operating cash flows during  net cash provided by operating activities was million  compared with million in the decrease is primarily due to increased working capital requirements  specifically at wps energy services and wisconsin public service 
inventories increased due to high natural gas prices at both wps energy services and wisconsin public service  as well as business growth at wps energy services 
the inventory increase is also the result of wps energy services taking advantage of opportunities to put additional gas into storage at favorable relationships to forward prices 
the change in receivables and payables was also attributable to the high natural gas prices as well as the business growth at wps energy services 
during  net cash provided by operating activities was million  compared with million in the increase is primarily due to an increase in income available for common shareholders after adjustment for certain non cash items  partially offset by an increase in cash used for working capital items 
the increase in accounts receivable was the result of increased sales volumes at wisconsin public service and wps energy services due to colder weather and customer growth 
increased natural gas purchases at wisconsin public service and wps energy services as the result of colder weather and customer growth contributed to the higher accounts payable balance 
investing cash flows net cash used for investing activities was million in compared to million in  a decrease of million 
the decrease is largely attributed to a million decrease in capital expenditures  mainly at the utilities  as well as a million increase in cash received from the sale of property  plant  and equipment 
partially offsetting this decrease was an increase in cash used for the purchase of equity investments and other acquisitions 
see asset sales and acquisitions below for further detail 
cash used for investing activities was million in compared to million in  an increase of million 
these factors were partially the result of cash used for the purchase of equity investments and other acquisitions discussed in more detail in asset sales and acquisitions below  a decrease in the sale of property  plant  and equipment  and a decrease in return of capital from the american transmission company 
the increase was partially offset by a decrease in capital expenditures 
the decrease in return of capital is due to the fact that in wps resources transferred transmission assets at their net book value to american transmission company in exchange for cash and an approximate ownership interest in american transmission company 
the decrease in the sale of property  plant  and equipment from to was due to the sale of land on the peshtigo river in northeastern wisconsin to the wisconsin department of natural resources  as well as wps power development s transactions surrounding its synthetic fuel facility 
asset sales and acquisitions certain acquisitions and asset sales that have a significant impact on investing cash flows are discussed below 
in addition  see note in notes to wps resources consolidated financial statements  acquisitions and sales of assets for a more detailed discussion of asset sales and acquisitions 
on december   wisconsin public service sold an additional acres of land near the peshtigo river to the wisconsin department of natural resources for million as part of a multi phase agreement reached between the parties in under the terms of the agreement  the wisconsin department of natural resources bought more than  acres of land for million in the sale is part of a five to seven year asset management strategy adopted by wps resources in on april   the public service commission of wisconsin approved wisconsin public service s request to transfer its interest in the wausau  wisconsin  to duluth  minnesota  transmission line to the american transmission company 
american transmission company is a for profit transmission only company created by the transfer of transmission assets previously owned by multiple electric utilities serving the upper midwest in exchange for an ownership interest in american transmission company 
wisconsin public service sold approximately million of assets at book value related to the wausau to duluth transmission line to american transmission company in june no gain or loss was recognized on the transaction 
wisconsin public service will continue to manage construction of the project and be responsible for obtaining property rights necessary for the construction of the project 
during  wps resources invested an additional million in american transmission company  increasing the consolidated wps resources ownership interest in american transmission company to 
wps resources contributed capital of million to eco coal pelletization in and million in on may   wps resources purchased a one third interest in guardian pipeline  llc from cms gas transmission company  for approximately million 
guardian pipeline owns a natural gas pipeline  which began operating in  that stretches about miles from near joliet  illinois  into southern wisconsin 
on december   wisconsin public service purchased the megawatt de pere energy center for million and terminated the related existing purchased power agreement 
wisconsin public service paid million at the close of the transaction and the remaining million in december effective june   wps power development acquired ch resources  inc from central hudson energy services  inc for million  including acquisition costs 
ch resources owns three power plants and associated assets in upstate new york with a combined capacity of megawatts 
in november  wps power development  through its subsidiary eco coal pelletization  llc  entered into a transaction to acquire the remaining interest in the synthetic fuel producing facility partially owned by eco from its partner 
concurrently  with this transaction  wps power development entered into a separate transaction with a subsidiary of a public company resulting in eco contributing of its synthetic fuel producing machinery to a newly formed entity in exchange for cash and a one third ownership interest in the newly formed entity 
these transactions generated a pre tax gain of million  of which million had been deferred as of december   as a result of certain rights of rescission and put options being granted to the buyer 
wps power development recognized all of the million deferred gain in the actual payments for the purchase of the former partner s interest in eco were contingent upon the same provisions referred to above 
as a result  million was originally held in escrow and released proportionately as the respective rescission rights and put options expired 
as of december   the escrow balance has been released as all contingencies have expired 
on december   wps power development sold a interest in eco wps power development received consideration of million cash  as well as a fixed note and a variable note 
payments under the variable note are contingent upon the synthetic fuel facility achieving specified levels of synthetic fuel production 
in conjunction with the sale  wps power development agreed to make certain payments to a third party broker  consisting of an up front payment of million which was paid at the time of closing  million which was paid in  and an additional million to be paid in a deferred gain of million and million was reflected on wps power development s balance sheet at december  and  respectively 
in  a pre tax gain in the amount of million was recognized as a component of miscellaneous income related to this transaction  of which million related to the recognition of a portion of the deferred gain referenced above 
similar annual gains are expected to result from this transaction through there was no gain recognized in related to this transaction 
capital expenditures capital expenditures by business segment for the years ended december    and are as follows years ended december  electric utility gas utility wps energy services wps power development other wps resources consolidated capital expenditures in the electric utility were higher in  as compared to  mainly due to the construction of portions of the pulliam combustion turbine at wisconsin public service in gas utility capital expenditures increased due to the installation of automated meter reading in wps power development s capital expenditures were higher in compared to due to the conversion of the combined locks energy center to a combined cycle system in capital expenditures at wps energy services remained fairly consistent between and as part of its regulated utility operations  on september  wisconsin public service submitted an application for a certificate of public convenience and necessity to the public service commission of wisconsin seeking approval to build a megawatt coal fired generation facility near wausau  wisconsin 
the facility is estimated to cost approximately million including the acquisition of coal trains  assuming the public service commission of wisconsin allows a current return on construction costs 
as of december   wisconsin public service has incurred a total cost of million related to this project 
in its rate order  the public service commission of wisconsin authorized deferral of costs related to development of the facility 
on november   wisconsin public service received a declaratory ruling allowing recovery of all reasonable costs up to million related to the project incurred or committed to prior to the public service commission of wisconsin s final decision regarding construction authorization 
in addition  wisconsin public service expects to incur additional construction costs of approximately million to fund construction of the transmission facilities required to support the generating facility through the date the generating facility goes into service 
american transmission company will reimburse wisconsin public service for the construction costs of the interconnection and related carrying costs when the generation facility becomes commercially operational 
on february   the public service commission of wisconsin determined wisconsin public service s application is complete 
the public service commission of wisconsin and the wisconsin department of natural resources now have days to make a decision on the project 
the public service commission of wisconsin may request from the dane county court of appeals one day extension 
the public service commission of wisconsin and the wisconsin department of natural resources will create an environmental impact statement 
the public will have opportunities to testify at public hearings 
technical hearings will also be held 
following a review of the application  the environmental impact statement  and the hearing testimony  the public service commission of wisconsin will determine if the proposed project will be approved  modified  or denied 
on february   wisconsin public service signed a letter of intent with dairyland power cooperative for electric supply alternatives for megawatts of energy from the proposed megawatt coal fired generation facility 
according to the agreement  dairyland could choose to purchase an interest in the plant or buy electricity from it we have since received written notification from dairyland  confirming their intent to purchase an interest in the plant 
in providing dairyland with electric supply alternatives  wisconsin public service can reduce the risks associated with building and operating the power plant 
the agreement is part of wisconsin public service s continuing plan to provide least cost reliable energy for the increasing electric demand of its customers 
this transaction is subject to a number of conditions including successfully developing a joint plant ownership and operating agreement  dairyland obtaining financing approval from the rural utility services  and dairyland securing firm transmission service from the midwest independent system operator on terms and conditions dairyland deems acceptable 
capital expenditures at the electric utility were million higher in  as compared to  mostly related to steam generator replacement at the kewaunee nuclear power plant that occurred in in the gas utility segment  capital expenditures increased by million in  partially due to the installation of automated meter reading 
the remaining increase is attributed to various one time projects that occurred in capital expenditures at wps energy services were million higher in compared to due to the construction of a gas storage field in wps power development s capital expenditures were million higher in compared to due to the completion of the combined locks energy center construction in financing cash flows net cash provided by financing activities was million in compared to million in the million increase in cash provided by financing activities in is primarily related to the decrease in cash provided by operating activities in compared to a larger amount of investing activities was financed through common stock and debt issuances in as compared to the prior year 
our financing activities provided cash inflows of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase was due to new debt issuances used to finance investing activities  offset by an increase in repayments of long term debt and the capital lease see significant financing activities below for further detail 
the net change in short term debt in from is attributable to the reduced need to rely on commercial paper in due to the issuance of additional long term debt at wisconsin public service and common stock at wps resources 
significant financing activities as of december   both wps resources and wisconsin public service were in compliance with all of the covenants under their lines of credit and other debt obligations 
wps resources and wisconsin public service established day credit line syndications for million and million  respectively  during the third quarter of the credit line syndications were million for wps resources and million for wisconsin public service 
the credit lines are used to back of wps resources and wisconsin public service s commercial paper borrowing programs and letters of credit for wps resources 
wps resources had outstanding commercial paper borrowings of million and million at december  and  respectively 
wps resources had outstanding short term debt of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
in  wps resources shelf registration statement for million was declared effective by the securities and exchange commission  which allows wps resources to issue any combination of debt and equity 
in november   shares of wps resources common stock were sold in a public offering at per share  which resulted in a net increase in equity of million 
net proceeds from this offering were used to retire million of trust preferred securities in january  reduce short term debt  fund equity contributions to subsidiary companies  and for general corporate purposes 
wisconsin public service corporation  under a registration statement declared effective in  issued million of year senior notes in december the senior notes are collateralized by a pledge of first mortgage bonds and may become non collateralized if wisconsin public service retires all of its outstanding first mortgage bonds 
the net proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes were used to call million of first mortgage bonds on january   fund construction costs and capital additions  reduce short term indebtedness  and for other corporate utility purposes 
effective january  we began issuing new shares of common stock under our stock investment plan and under certain stock based employee benefit plans 
equity increased million  million  and million in   and  respectively  as a result of these plans 
wps resources also repurchased million  million  and million of outstanding common stock for stock based compensation plans in   and  respectively 
wisconsin public service used short term debt to retire million of first mortgage bonds on february  that had reached maturity 
wisconsin public service also called million of tax exempt bonds in may wisconsin public service is evaluating the potential for refinancing existing debt in in march  upper peninsula power retired million of first mortgage bonds that had reached maturity 
in november  wps power development retired all of the notes payable under a revolving credit note  in the amount of million in october  wisconsin public service retired million of first mortgage bonds that had reached maturity 
wps resources issued million of year senior non collateralized notes in november we used approximately million of the net proceeds from the issuance of these notes to repay short term debt incurred to provide equity capital to our subsidiaries and the remainder for other corporate purposes 
wisconsin public service issued million of year senior notes in december the senior notes are collateralized by a pledge of first mortgage bonds and may become non collateralized if wisconsin public service retires all of its outstanding first mortgage bonds 
wisconsin public service used approximately million of the net proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes to acquire the de pere energy center and million to retire short term debt 
the balance of the net proceeds was used for other corporate utility purposes 
credit ratings wps resources uses internally generated funds and commercial paper borrowing to satisfy most of its capital requirements 
we also periodically issue long term debt and common stock to reduce short term debt  maintain desired capitalization ratios  and fund future growth 
we may seek nonrecourse financing for funding nonregulated acquisitions 
wps resources commercial paper borrowing program provides for working capital requirements of the nonregulated businesses and upper peninsula power 
wisconsin public service has its own commercial paper borrowing program 
the specific forms of long term financing  amounts  and timing depend on the availability of projects  market conditions  and other factors 
the current credit ratings for wps resources and wisconsin public service are listed in the table below 
credit ratings standard poor s moody s wps resources corporation senior unsecured debt commercial paper credit line syndication a a a p a wisconsin public service corporation bonds preferred stock commercial paper credit line syndication aa a a aa a p aa in november  moody s downgraded its long term ratings for wps resources and wisconsin public service one ratings level  leaving only commercial paper ratings unchanged 
moody s downgrade of wps resources was based principally on a gradual shift in the company s financial and business risk profile attributable to the growth of nonregulated businesses  the impact of weaker wholesale power markets  and a relatively high dividend payout 
moody s downgrade of wisconsin public service is based on the expectation that the utility s substantial capital spending program will exceed its retained cash flow through  which is likely to lead to a meaningful increase in debt 
following the downgrade  moody s set the ratings outlook at stable for both wps resources and wisconsin public service 
we believe these ratings continue to be among the best in the energy industry  and allow us to access commercial paper and long term debt markets on favorable terms 
credit ratings are not recommendations to buy  are subject to change  and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 
rating agencies use a number of both quantitative and qualitative measures in determining a company s credit rating 
these measures include business risk  liquidity risk  competitive position  capital mix  financial condition  predictability of cash flows  management strength  and future direction 
some of the quantitative measures can be analyzed through a few key financial ratios  while the qualitative ones are more subjective 
wps resources and wisconsin public service hold credit lines to back of their commercial paper borrowing and letters of credit 
these credit facilities are based on a credit rating of a p for wps resources and a p for wisconsin public service 
a decrease in the commercial paper credit ratings could adversely affect the companies by increasing the interest rates at which they can borrow and potentially limiting the availability of funds to the companies through the commercial paper market 
a restriction in the companies ability to use commercial paper borrowing to meet their working capital needs would require them to secure funds through alternate sources resulting in higher interest expense  higher credit line fees  and a potential delay in the availability of funds 
wps energy services maintains underlying agreements to support its electric and gas trading operations 
in the event of a deterioration of wps resources credit rating  many of these agreements allow the counterparty to demand additional assurance of payment 
this provision could pertain to existing business  new business or both with the counterparty 
the additional assurance requirements could be met with letters of credit  surety bonds or cash deposits and would likely result in wps resources being required to maintain increased bank lines of credit or incur additional expenses  and could restrict the amount of business wps energy services can conduct 
wps energy services uses the nymex and over the counter financial markets to hedge its exposure to physical customer obligations 
these hedges are closely correlated to the customer contracts  but price movements on the hedge contracts may require financial backing 
certain movements in price for contracts through the nymex exchange require posting of cash deposits equal to the market move 
for the over the counter market  the underlying contract may allow the counterparty to require additional collateral to cover the net financial differential between the original contract price and the current forward market 
increased requirements related to market price changes usually only result in a temporary liquidity need that will unwind as the sales contracts are fulfilled 
future capital requirements and resources contractual obligations the following table summarizes the contractual obligations of wps resources  including its subsidiaries 
payments due by period contractual obligations as of december  millions total amounts committed less than year to years to years over years long term debt principal and interest payments operating leases commodity purchase obligations purchase orders capital contributions to equity method investment other total contractual cash obligations long term debt principal and interest payments represent bonds issued  notes issued  and loans made to wps resources and its subsidiaries 
we record all principal obligations on the balance sheet 
commodity purchase obligations represent mainly commodity purchase contracts of wps resources and its subsidiaries 
the energy supply contracts at wps energy services summarized above generally have offsetting energy sale contracts 
wisconsin public service expects to recover the costs of its contracts in future customer rates 
purchase orders include obligations related to normal business operations and large construction obligations 
other mainly represents expected pension and post retirement funding obligations for the years of and capital requirements wisconsin public service makes large investments in capital assets 
net construction expenditures are expected to be approximately  million in the aggregate for the through period upon the closing of the sale of the kewaunee nuclear power plant  expenditures would decrease approximately million during this period 
the largest of these expenditures is for the construction of the megawatt coal fired generation facility near wausau  wisconsin  in which wisconsin public service is expected to incur costs of million between through in addition  wisconsin public service expects to incur additional construction costs of approximately million between and to fund construction of the transmission facilities required to support the generating facility 
other significant anticipated expenditures during this three year period include combustion turbines million pollution control equipment million corporate services infrastructures million automated meter reading million nuclear fuel million mercury control projects million other capital requirements for the three year period include a potential contribution of million to the kewaunee nuclear power plant decommissioning trust fund depending on the sale of the kewaunee assets 
on april   the public service commission of wisconsin approved wisconsin public service s request to transfer its interest in the wausau  wisconsin  to duluth  minnesota  transmission line to the american transmission company 
wps resources committed to fund of total project costs incurred up to million  and receive additional equity in american transmission company 
wps resources may terminate funding if the project extends beyond january  on december   wisconsin public service and american transmission company received approval to continue the project with the new cost estimates of million 
the updated cost estimate reflects additional costs for the project resulting from time delays  added regulatory requirements  changes and additions to the project at the request of local governments and american transmission company s management  and overhead costs 
completion of the line is expected in wps resources has the right  but not the obligation  to provide additional funding in excess of million up to its portion of the revised cost estimate 
for the period through  we expect to make capital contributions of up to million for our portion of the wausau to duluth transmission line 
in exchange  we will receive increased ownership in the american transmission company 
wps resources expects to provide additional capital contributions of approximately million to american transmission company in for other projects 
upper peninsula power is expected to incur construction expenditures of about million in the aggregate for the period through  primarily for electric distribution improvements and repairs and safety measures at hydroelectric facilities 
capital expenditures identified at wps power development for through are expected to be approximately million  including million at the sunbury facility  which will be reimbursed by duquesne light holdings if the sale of sunbury is consummated see note in notes to wps resources consolidated financial statements  assets held for sale  for a more detailed discussion of the sale of the sunbury facility 
capital expenditures identified at wps energy services for through are expected to be approximately million 
all projected capital and investment expenditures are subject to periodic review and revision and may vary significantly from the estimates depending on a number of factors  including  but not limited to  industry restructuring  regulatory constraints  acquisition opportunities  market volatility  and economic trends 
other capital expenditures for wps resources and its subsidiaries for through could be significant depending on its success in pursuing development and acquisition opportunities 
when appropriate  wps resources may seek nonrecourse financing for a portion of the cost of these acquisitions 
capital resources for the period through  wps resources plans to use internally generated funds net of forecasted dividend payments  cash proceeds from pending asset sales  and debt and equity financings to fund capital requirements 
wps resources plans to maintain current debt to equity ratios 
management believes wps resources has adequate financial flexibility and resources to meet its future needs 
wps resources has the ability to issue up to an additional million of debt or equity under its currently effective shelf registration statement 
wisconsin public service has the ability to issue up to an additional million of debt under its currently effective shelf registration statement 
wisconsin public service intends to file a new shelf registration statement in for an additional million 
wps resources and wisconsin public service have day credit line syndications for million and million  respectively 
the credit lines are used to back of wps resources and wisconsin public service s commercial paper borrowing programs and letters of credit for wps resources 
as of december   there was a total of million available under the lines of credit  net of million of outstanding commercial paper  and million in cash and cash equivalents 
in  wps resources announced the sale of wps power development s sunbury generation plant and wisconsin public service announced the sale of its portion of the kewaunee nuclear power plant 
both of these sales are expected to close in a portion of the proceeds related to the sunbury sale may be used to pay the non recourse debt related to the plant 
a portion of the proceeds related to the kewaunee sale will be used to retire debt at wisconsin public service 
the remainder of the proceeds from both the sunbury and kewaunee sales will be used by wps resources for investing activities and general corporate purposes of its subsidiaries  including reducing the amount of outstanding debt 
for more information regarding the sunbury and kewaunee sale  see the discussion below 
other future considerations sunbury generation plant as a result of both market conditions and issues related to the physical performance of the plant  the sunbury generation plant has not met our projected near term financial performance levels 
market conditions continue to be depressed due to low prices for capacity 
sunbury also incurred significant outage time during to maintain and repair fuel handling and recently installed environmental control equipment that experienced accelerated wear from the use of low grade fuel in some of the units 
operational issues related to sunbury have been resolved or a plan has been put in place to resolve them 
wps resources made capital contributions of million to sunbury in to compensate for the impact of decreased capacity revenues  as well as adjustments to sunbury s operating plan 
for  wps resources board of directors has granted authorization to contribute up to million of capital to sunbury 
these funds will be used to cover operating losses  make principal and interest payments  and purchase emission allowances 
on october   wps power development entered into a definitive agreement to sell its sunbury generation plant to a subsidiary of duquesne light holdings for approximately million  subject to certain working capital adjustments and regulatory approval 
see note in notes to wps resources consolidated financial statements  assets held for sale  for more information 
kewaunee nuclear power plant on november   wisconsin public service and wisconsin power and light company entered into a definitive agreement to sell the kewaunee nuclear power plant to a subsidiary of dominion resources  inc wisconsin public service is a owner of the kewaunee nuclear power plant 
the transaction is subject to approval from various regulatory agencies  including the public service commission of wisconsin  the federal energy regulatory commission  the nuclear regulatory commission  and several other state utility regulatory agencies and is projected to close in approval has already been obtained from the iowa public utility commission 
wisconsin public service estimates that its share of the cash proceeds from the sale will approximate million  subject to various post closing adjustments 
the cash proceeds from the sale are expected to slightly exceed the carrying value of the wisconsin public service assets being sold 
in addition to the cash proceeds  wisconsin public service will retain ownership of the assets contained in its non qualified decommissioning trust  one of two funds that were established to cover the eventual decommissioning of the kewaunee nuclear power plant 
the pretax fair value of the non qualified decommissioning trust s assets at december  was million 
dominion will assume responsibility for the eventual decommissioning of kewaunee and will receive wisconsin public service s qualified decommissioning trust assets that had a fair value of million at december  wisconsin public service will request deferral of the gain expected to result from this transaction and related costs from the public service commission of wisconsin 
accordingly  the gain on the sale of the plant assets and the related non qualified decommissioning trust assets is expected to be returned to customers under future rate orders 
regulatory wisconsin effective march   wisconsin public service received approval to increase wisconsin retail electric rates million and decrease wisconsin retail natural gas rates million 
the electric and retail natural gas rates reflect a return on equity and allowed average equity of in the utility s capital structure 
on april   wisconsin public service filed an application with the public service commission of wisconsin for authorization to increase retail electric rates and retail natural gas rates  effective january  the rate increases are necessary to recover the costs associated with the purchase of the de pere energy center  fuel costs  maintenance of power production facilities  and employee benefits 
on december   the public service commission of wisconsin issued a final written order authorizing a retail electric rate increase of million and a retail natural gas rate increase of million  effective january  the rates reflect a return on equity 
the public service commission of wisconsin also approved average equity of in the utility s capital structure 
the amount of fuel and purchased power costs wisconsin public service is authorized to recover in rates is established in its general rate filings 
if the actual fuel and purchased power costs vary from the authorized level by more than on an annual basis  wisconsin public service is allowed  or may be required  to file an application adjusting rates for the remainder of the year to reflect actual costs for the year to date and updated projected costs 
on october   wisconsin public service filed to reduce rates by million  due to a reduction in the costs of fuel and purchased power  for the period august  through december  on february   the public service commission of wisconsin approved a refund of million  which represents the originally filed amounts  adjustments  and interest 
this refund is expected to be credited to customer accounts in march a liability of million was accrued as of december  in anticipation of this refund 
as a result of the kewaunee nuclear power plant unplanned outage in late january and early february and other fuel cost increases in  wisconsin public service filed for a fuel cost increase of million on february  the public service commission of wisconsin has scheduled a hearing for march  to determine the amount of the fuel cost increase to be recovered on an interim basis 
wisconsin public service expects that a final order will be issued in summer regarding this rate increase request 
michigan wisconsin public service filed for an increase in electric rates in the first quarter of on july   the michigan public service commission authorized an increase in electric rates of million and the recovery of an additional million of transmission costs through the power supply cost recovery mechanism  effective july  on december   the michigan public service commission approved an increase in retail electric rates for customers of upper peninsula power 
the michigan public service commission granted an return on equity with the new rates being effective december  this was the first base rate increase for upper peninsula power in years 
michigan authorizes a one for one fuel and purchased power recovery mechanism for prudently incurred costs 
under the mechanism  the difference between actual and authorized fuel and purchased power costs is deferred until year end 
by march of the following year  the utility must file a reconciliation of the actual costs to the authorized costs 
any under or over recovery is then recovered from rates or returned to the ratepayer through the end of the following year 
the reconciliation is subject to review and intervention by customers 
at december  upper peninsula power had significantly under recovered fuel and purchased power costs due to the high costs of purchased power 
upper peninsula power intends to file  in march  a reconciliation of the purchased power costs requesting recovery of million 
in addition  costs associated with the presque isle power plant outage have been deferred and are expected to be addressed along with other dead river flood issues in the next rate case 
upper peninsula power expects a final decision regarding the recovery of the fuel costs no later than the end of due to the level of the under recovery relative to upper peninsula power s revenues  the deferred cost may be recovered over more than one year 
federal on april   wisconsin public service received a draft order from the federal energy regulatory commission approving a  or million  interim increase in wholesale electric rates 
the new wholesale rates were effective on may   and are subject to refund if the final rate increase is less 
the draft order also granted the use of formula rates  which allow for the adjustment of wholesale electric rates to reflect actual costs without having to file additional rate requests 
on march   the federal energy regulatory commission and wisconsin public service reached a tentative settlement regarding the final rate increase 
wisconsin public service anticipates no material refunds or other adjustments to revenues recorded under the interim rates based on the terms of the tentative agreement 
the final settlement is anticipated to be filed with the federal energy regulatory commission in the second quarter of this is wisconsin public service s first rate increase for its wholesale electric customers in years 
asset management strategy in  wps resources initiated an asset management strategy  whereby assets  or business units  no longer required for operations would be disposed over the next to years in a manner that allows recognition of profits and provides capital for redeployment into new opportunities 
in conjunction with the execution of a part of this strategy  the company has identified certain assets to be disposed of consisting primarily of land and some buildings  the sale of which is expected to provide basic earnings per share between and  annually  through off balance sheet arrangements wps resources as part of normal business  wps resources and its subsidiaries enter into various guarantees providing financial or performance assurance to third parties on behalf of certain subsidiaries 
these guarantees are entered into primarily to support or enhance the creditworthiness otherwise attributed to a subsidiary on a stand alone basis  thereby facilitating the extension of sufficient credit to accomplish the subsidiaries intended commercial purposes 
the guarantees issued by wps resources include intercompany guarantees between parents and their subsidiaries  which are eliminated in consolidation  and guarantees of the subsidiaries own performance 
as such  these guarantees are excluded from the recognition  measurement  and disclosure requirements of financial accounting standards board interpretation no

the underlying debt related to these guarantees is reflected on the consolidated balance sheet 
wps resources board of directors has authorized management to issue corporate guarantees in the aggregate amount of up to billion to support the business operations of wps energy services 
wps resources primarily issues the guarantees to counterparties in the wholesale electric and natural gas marketplace to provide counterparties the assurance that wps energy services will perform on its obligations and permit wps energy services to operate within these markets 
the amount of guarantees actually issued by wps resources to support the business operations at wps energy services at december  was million and this is reflected in the table above 
the amount actually supported is dependent on the amount of outstanding business wps energy services has with the counterparties holding the guarantees at any point in time 
wps resources reflects wps energy services obligations supported by these parental guarantees on its consolidated balance sheet either as accounts payable or liabilities from risk management activities 
at december   wps resources had issued million in corporate guarantees to support the business operation of wps power development  which are reflected in the above table 
wps resources issues the guarantees for indemnification obligations related to business purchase agreements and counterparties in the wholesale electric marketplace to meet their credit requirements and permit wps power development to operate within these markets 
the amount supported is dependent on the amount of the outstanding obligation that wps power development has with the parties holding the guarantees at any point in time 
wps resources reflects wps power development s obligations supported by these parental guarantees on its consolidated balance sheet as either accounts payable or other liabilities 
in february  wps resources board of directors authorized management to issue corporate guarantees in the aggregate amount of up to million to support business operations at wps power development in addition to guarantees that have received specific authorizations 
another million of corporate guarantees support energy supply at upper peninsula power and are not reflected on wps resources consolidated balance sheet 
in february  wps resources board of directors authorized management to issue corporate guarantees in the aggregate amount of up to million to support the business operations of upper peninsula power 
corporate guarantees issued in the future under the board authorized limit may or may not be reflected on wps resources consolidated balance sheet  depending on the nature of the guarantee 
at wps resources request  financial institutions have issued million in standby letters of credit for the benefit of third parties that have extended credit to certain subsidiaries 
if a subsidiary does not pay amounts when due under a covered contract  the counterparty may present its claim for payment to the financial institution  which will request payment from wps resources 
any amounts owed by our subsidiaries are reflected in the consolidated balance sheet 
at december   wps resources furnished million of surety bonds for various reasons including worker compensation coverage and obtaining various licenses  permits  and rights of way 
liabilities incurred as a result of activities covered by surety bonds are included in the consolidated balance sheet 
other guarantee of million listed on the above table was issued by wisconsin public service to indemnify a third party for exposures related to the construction of utility assets 
this amount is not reflected on the consolidated balance sheet 
wps resources has not identified any material variable interest entities created  or interests in variable entities obtained  after january  that require consolidation or disclosure under the financial accounting standard board s revised interpretation no 
r  and we continue to assess the existence of any interests in variable interest entities  not classified as special purpose entities  created on or prior to january  the application of interpretation no 
r was required for interests in special purpose entities for periods ending after december  wpsr capital trust i was deconsolidated from the consolidated financial statements of wps resources at december   as required by the provisions of interpretation no 
r related to special purpose entities 
as a result of the deconsolidation  wps resources recorded a million investment in the trust within other current assets and a million note payable to preferred stock trust  respectively  within the consolidated balance sheet

wps resources currently anticipates that we will disclose information about a variable interest entity upon implementation of interpretation no 
r in the first quarter of through an affiliate of wps power development  inc  wps resources owns a partial interest in a synthetic fuel production facility located in kentucky and receives tax credits pursuant to section of the internal revenue code based on sales to unaffiliated third party purchasers of synthetic fuel produced from coal 
at december   wps resources had a ownership interest in the synthetic fuel facility 
section tax credits generated by the facility are currently scheduled to expire at the end of wps resources maximum exposure to loss as a result of our involvement with this potential variable interest entity is limited to our investment in the entity  which is not significant at december  currently  we do not believe that wps resources is the primary beneficiary of this entity and do not anticipate consolidation of the synthetic fuel facility upon adoption of interpretation no 
r in the first quarter of trading activities wps resources wps energy services measures the fair value of contracts  including nymex exchange and over the counter contracts  natural gas options  natural gas and electric power physical fixed price contracts  basis contracts  and related financial instruments on a mark to market basis using risk management systems 
the primary input for natural gas pricing is the settled forward price curve of the nymex exchange  which includes contracts and options 
basis pricing is derived from published indices and documented broker quotes 
wps energy services bases electric prices on published indices and documented broker quotes 
the following table provides an assessment of the factors impacting the change in the net value of wps energy services assets and liabilities from risk management activities during the months ended december  wps energy services  inc mark to market roll forward millions natural gas electric total fair value of contracts at january  less contracts realized or settled during period plus fair value of new contracts entered into during period other changes in fair value cumulative effect of rescission of issue no 
fair value of contracts at december  the fair value of contracts at january  and december  reflect the values reported on the balance sheet for net mark to market current and long term risk management assets and liabilities as of those dates 
contracts realized or settled during the period include the value of contracts in existence at january  that were no longer included in the net mark to market assets as of december  and the amortization of those derivatives designated as normal purchases and sales under statement no 
mark to market gains and losses related to contracts that were entered into subsequent to january   that are still included in wps energy services portfolio at december   are included in the fair value of new contracts entered into during the period 
there were  in many cases  offsetting positions entered into and settled during the period resulting in gains or losses being realized during the current period 
the realized gains or losses from these offsetting positions are not reflected in the table above 
the other changes in fair value line in the table primarily represents the reversal of the change in the fair value of gas storage contracts as of january  with the rescission of issue no 
 natural gas storage contracts are accounted for on an accrual basis and are no longer adjusted to fair value 
the cumulative effect of rescission of issue no 
is the reversal of the december  risk management assets and liabilities that no longer qualify for mark to market accounting with the rescission of issue no

we derive the pricing for all contracts in the above table from active quotes or external sources 
pricing is the most significant variable in the mark to market calculations 
wps energy services  as a result of wps power development s acquisition of generating assets in new york  has acquired transmission congestion contracts  which are financial contracts  that hedge price risk between zones within the new york independent system operator 
the contracts were marked to fair value using a combination of modeled forward prices and market quotes 
the fair market value of the contracts at december  was million 
critical accounting policies wps resources in may  the securities and exchange commission issued proposed rules regarding the identification and disclosure of accounting estimates a company makes in applying its accounting policies and the disclosure of initial adoption by a company of an accounting policy that has a material impact on its financial presentation 
under the first part of the proposal  a company would have to identify the accounting estimates reflected in its financial statements that required it to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time of estimation 
disclosures about those estimates would then be required if different estimates that the company reasonably could have used in the current period  or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  would have a material impact on the presentation of the company s financial condition  changes in financial condition or results of operations 
the securities and exchange commission accepted comments on the proposed rules through july  and has not made any final decisions since that time 
in anticipation of at least parts of this proposed rule being made final  we have identified the following accounting policies to be critical to the understanding of our financial statements because their application requires significant judgment and reliance on estimations of matters that are inherently uncertain 
risk management activities wps resources has entered into contracts that are accounted for as derivatives under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended 
at december   those derivatives not designated as hedges are primarily commodity contracts to manage price risk associated with wholesale and retail natural gas purchase and sale activities and electric energy contracts 
management s expectations and intentions are key factors in determining the appropriate accounting for a derivative transaction  and as a result  such expectations and intentions are documented 
cash flow hedge accounting treatment may be used when wps resources contracts to buy or sell a commodity at a fixed price for future delivery corresponding with anticipated physical sales or purchases 
fair value hedge accounting may be used when wps resources holds firm commitments and enters into transactions that hedge the risk that the price of a commodity may change between the contract s inception and the physical delivery date of the commodity 
to the extent that the fair value of a hedge instrument is fully effective in offsetting the transaction being hedged  there is no impact on income available for common shareholders prior to settlement of the hedge 
in addition  wps resources may apply the normal purchases and normal sales exemption  provided by statement no 
 as amended  to certain contracts 
the normal purchases and sales exception provides that no recognition of the contract s fair value in the consolidated financial statements is required until the settlement of the contract 
derivatives contracts that are determined to fall within the scope of statement no 
 as amended  are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet of wps resources 
changes in fair value  except those related to derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges  are generally included in the determination of income available for common shareholders at each financial reporting date until the contracts are ultimately settled 
when available  quoted market prices are used to record a contract s fair value 
if no active trading market exists for a commodity or for a contract s duration  fair value is estimated through the use of internally developed valuation techniques or models 
such estimates require significant judgment as to assumptions and valuation methodologies deemed appropriate by wps resources management 
as a component of the fair value determination  wps resources maintains reserves to account for the estimated costs of servicing and holding certain of its contracts based upon administrative costs  credit counterparty risk  and servicing margin with both fixed and variable components 
the effect of changing both the administrative costs and credit counterparty risk assumptions is as follows change in assumption millions effect to operating reserve at december  increase decrease these potential changes to the operating reserve would be shown as part of the nonregulated cost of fuel  gas and purchased power on the consolidated statements of income and assets liabilities from risk management activities on the consolidated balance sheets 
asset impairment wps resources annually reviews its assets for impairment 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment and disposal of long lived assets  and statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  are the basis for these analyses 
the review for impairment of tangible assets is more critical to wps power development than to our other segments because of its significant investment in property  plant  and equipment and lack of access to regulatory relief that is available to our regulated segments 
we believe that the accounting estimate related to asset impairment of power plants is a critical accounting estimate because the estimate is susceptible to change from period to period because it requires company management to make assumptions about future market sales pricing  production costs  and generation volumes and the impact that recognizing an impairment would have on the assets reported on our balance sheet and the net loss on our income statement could be material 
management s assumptions about future market sales prices and generation volumes require significant judgment because actual market sales prices and generation volumes have fluctuated in the past as a result of changing fuel costs  environmental changes  and required plant maintenance and are expected to continue to do so in the future 
the primary estimates used at wps power development in this process are future revenue streams and operating costs 
a combination of input from both internal and external sources is used to project revenue streams 
wps power development s operations group projects future operating costs with input from external sources for fuel costs and forward energy prices 
these estimates are modeled over the projected remaining life of the power plants using the methodology defined in statement no 
wps power development evaluates property  plant  and equipment for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist 
statement requires that if the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows from a company s asset is less than the carrying value of the asset  an asset impairment must be recognized in the financial statements 
the amount of impairment recognized is calculated by reducing the carrying value of the asset to its fair value 
throughout  wps power development tested power plants for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicated that their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
no impairment charges were recorded in as a result of these recoverability tests 
the merger of wisconsin fuel and light into wisconsin public service in resulted in wisconsin public service recording goodwill related to its gas utility segment 
the goodwill is tested for impairment yearly based on the guidance of statement no 
the test for impairment includes assumptions about future profitability of the gas utility segment and the correlation between our gas utility segment and published projections for other similar gas utility segments 
a significant change in the gas utility market and or our projections of future profitability could result in a loss being recorded on the income statement related to a decrease in the goodwill asset  as a result of the impairment test 
receivables and reserves our regulated gas and electric utilities and wps energy services accrue estimated amounts of revenue for services rendered but not yet billed 
estimated unbilled sales are calculated using actual generation and throughput volumes  recorded sales  and weather factors 
the estimated unbilled sales are assigned different rates based on historical customer class allocations 
any difference between actual sales and the estimates or weather factors would cause a change in the estimated revenue 
wps resources reserves for potential uncollectible customer accounts as an expense on the income statement and an uncollectible reserve on the balance sheet 
wisconsin public service records a regulatory asset to offset its uncollectible reserve 
due to the nature of the nonregulated energy marketing business having higher credit risk  the reserve is more critical to wps energy services than to our other segments 
at wps energy services  the reserve is based on historical uncollectible experience and specific customer identification where practical 
if the assumption that historical uncollectible experience matches current customer default is incorrect  or if a specific customer with a large account receivable that has not previously been identified as a risk defaults  there could be significant changes to the expense and uncollectible reserve balance 
pension and postretirement benefits the costs of providing non contributory defined pension benefits and other postretirement benefits described in note to the consolidated financial statements  are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience 
pension costs  for example  are impacted by actual employee demographics including age  compensation levels  and employment periods  the level of contributions we make to the plan  and earnings on plan assets 
changes made to the plan provisions may also impact current and future pension costs 
pension costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions  including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the projected benefit obligation and pension costs 
other postretirement benefit costs  for example  are impacted by actual employee demographics including age and compensation levels  the level of contributions we make to the plans  earnings on plan assets  and health care cost trends 
changes made to the plan provisions may also impact current and future other postretirement benefit costs 
other postretirement benefit costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions  including anticipated rates of return on plan assets  health care cost trend rates  and the discount rates used in determining the postretirement benefit obligation and postretirement costs 
wps resources pension plan assets and other postretirement benefit plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments 
fluctuations in actual equity market returns as well as changes in general interest rates may result in increased or decreased pension costs in future periods 
likewise  changes in assumptions regarding current discount rates and expected rates of return on plan assets could also increase or decrease recorded pension costs 
changes in assumptions regarding current discount rates  health care cost trend rates  and expected rates of return on plan assets could also increase or decrease recorded other postretirement benefit costs 
management believes that such changes in costs would be recovered at our regulated segments through the ratemaking process 
the following chart reflects the sensitivities associated with a change in certain actuarial assumptions by the indicated percentage 
the chart below reflects an increase or decrease in the percentage for each assumption  and how each change would impact the projected benefit obligation  our net amount recognized on the balance sheet  and our reported annual pension cost on the income statement as they relate to our two large qualified pension plans

in selecting an assumed rate of return on plan assets  we consider the historical returns and the future expectations for returns for each asset class  as well as the target allocation of the benefit trust portfolios 
the fair value of pension plan assets increased million in  decreased million in  and decreased million in as further described in note to the consolidated financial statements  as a result of the declining interest rate environment  we were required to recognize an additional minimum liability as prescribed by statement no 
the liability was recorded as an intangible asset  a regulatory asset  and a reduction to common equity through a charge to other comprehensive income 
the charge to other comprehensive income could be restored through common equity in future periods to the extent fair value of trust assets exceed the accumulated benefit obligation 
also  pension cost and cash funding requirements could increase in future years without continued improved asset returns 
the fair value of other postretirement benefit plan assets increased million in  decreased million in  and decreased million in in selecting assumed health care cost trend rates  we consider past performance and forecasts of health care costs 
wps resources adjusted its health care cost trend rates upwards each of the last two years in an attempt to keep our health care cost trend rates in line with the rapidly increasing health care costs the country and wps resources have faced 
also  other postretirement benefit cost and cash funding could increase in future years without continued improved asset returns 
regulatory accounting the electric and gas utility segments of wps resources follow statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  and our financial statements reflect the effects of the different ratemaking principles followed by the various jurisdictions regulating these segments 
we defer certain items that would otherwise be immediately recognized as expenses and revenues because our regulators have authorized deferral as regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities for future recovery or refund to customers 
future recovery of regulatory assets is not assured  but are generally subject to review by regulators in rate proceedings for matters such as prudence and reasonableness 
management regularly assesses whether these regulatory assets and liabilities are probable of future recovery or refund by considering factors such as regulatory environment changes and the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation 
once approved  we reduce regulatory assets and liabilities by recognition in income over the rate recovery period 
if not approved  these regulatory assets or liabilities would be recognized in income in the then current period 
if our electric and gas utility segments no longer meet the criteria for applying statement no 
 we would discontinue its application as defined under statement no 
 regulated enterprises accounting for the discontinuation of application of fasb statement no 
assets and liabilities recognized solely due to the actions of rate regulation may no longer be recognized on the balance sheet and would be classified as an extraordinary item in income for the period in which the discontinuation occurs 
a write off of all wps resources regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities at december  would result in a decrease in total assets  a decrease in total liabilities  and a increase in income before taxes 
tax provision as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as depreciation  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase or decrease this allowance in a period  we must include an expense or benefit within the tax provisions in the statements of operations

management service fees paid to nuclear management company in and reflect a increase in wisconsin public service s ownership of the kewaunee plant after acquiring madison gas and electric company s ownership in the kewaunee plant on september  trends wps resources environmental wps resources and its subsidiaries are subject to federal  state  and local regulations regarding environmental impacts of their operations on air and water quality and solid waste 
the application of federal and state restrictions to protect the environment can involve review  certification  or issuance of permits by various federal and state authorities  including the united states environmental protection agency and the various states environmental agencies  including the wisconsin department of natural resources 
these restrictions may limit  prevent  or substantially increase the cost of the operation of generation facilities and may require substantial investments in new equipment at existing installations 
such restrictions may require substantial additional investments for new projects and may delay or prevent completion of projects 
we cannot forecast the effects of such regulation on our generation  transmission  and other facilities or operations 
wps power development is subject to regulation by the united states environmental protection agency and environmental regulation in maine  new york  pennsylvania  and wisconsin with respect to thermal and other discharges from its power plants 
new legislation could negatively impact future cash flows and impact wps power development s ability to compete with regulated utilities  which are allowed recovery of these costs 
wps energy services is not directly subject to significant environmental regulations at this time 
wisconsin public service continues to investigate the environmental cleanup of ten manufactured gas plant sites  two of which were previously owned by wisconsin fuel and light 
as of the fall of  cleanup of the land portion at five sites was substantially complete 
groundwater treatment and monitoring at these sites will continue into the future 
river sediment remains to be addressed at six sites with sediment contamination 
wisconsin public service estimates remaining future undiscounted investigation and cleanup costs for all remaining site work to be million to million and recorded a million liability for gas plant cleanup with an offsetting regulatory asset at december  wisconsin public service expects to recover cleanup costs net of insurance recoveries in future customer rates 
the united states environmental protection agency has designated southeastern wisconsin as an ozone non attainment area 
under the clean air act  the state of wisconsin developed a nitrogen oxide reduction plan for wisconsin s ozone non attainment area 
the nitrogen oxide reductions began in and will gradually increase through wisconsin public service owns of edgewater unit  which is located in the ozone non attainment area 
a compliance plan for this unit was initiated in wisconsin public service s share of the costs of this project is expected to be approximately million 
the project is nearly complete 
wisconsin public service has incurred approximately million on this project as of december  the state of wisconsin is also seeking voluntary reductions from utility units outside the ozone non attainment area  which may lead to additional expenditures for nitrogen oxide reductions at other units 
wisconsin public service is participating in voluntary efforts to reduce nitrogen oxide levels at the columbia energy center 
wisconsin public service owns of the columbia facility 
the public service commission of wisconsin has approved recovery of the costs associated with voluntary nitrogen oxide reductions 
air quality modeling by the wisconsin department of natural resources revealed that weston units and contribute to a modeled exceedance of the sulfur dioxide ambient air quality standard 
wisconsin public service expects that compliance with a future limit can be achieved by managing the coal supply quality 
wisconsin public service is cooperating with the wisconsin department of natural resources to develop an approach to resolve this issue 
in november  the united states environmental protection agency announced the commencement of a clean air act enforcement initiative targeting the utility industry 
this initiative resulted in the issuance of several notices of violation findings of violation and the filing of lawsuits against other unaffiliated utilities 
in these enforcement proceedings  the united states environmental protection agency claims that the utilities made modifications to the coal fired boilers and related equipment at the utilities electric generating stations without first obtaining appropriate permits under the united states environmental protection agency s pre construction permit program and without installing appropriate air pollution control equipment 
in addition  the united states environmental protection agency is claiming  in certain situations  that there were violations of the clean air act s new source performance standards 
in the matters where actions have been commenced  the federal government is seeking penalties and the installation of pollution control equipment 
if the federal government decided to bring a claim against wisconsin public service and if it were determined by a court that historic projects at the pulliam and weston electric generating stations required either a state or federal clean air act permit  wisconsin public service may  under the applicable statutes  be required to shut down any unit found to be operating in non compliance  install additional pollution control equipment  pay a fine  and or pay a fine and conduct a supplemental environmental project in order to resolve any such claim 
the wisconsin department of natural resources initiated a rulemaking effort to control mercury emissions 
coal fired generation plants are the primary targets of this effort 
the proposed rule was open to comment in october as proposed  the rule requires phased in mercury emission reductions reaching reduction in years 
wisconsin public service estimates that it could cost approximately million to achieve the proposed reductions 
presently  the proposed rule is on hold  and it is uncertain if the state will proceed to finalize the regulations 
in december  the united states environmental protection agency proposed mercury maximum achievable control technology standards and an alternative mercury cap and trade program substantially modeled on the clear skies legislation initiative 
in addition  the united states environmental protection agency proposed the interstate air quality rule  which would reduce sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions from utility boilers located in states  including wisconsin 
wisconsin public service is in the process of studying the proposed rules 
as to the mercury maximum achievable control technology proposal  it requires existing units burning sub bituminous coal to achieve an annual average mercury emission rate limit of pounds per trillion btu on a unit by unit or plant wide basis 
new units must achieve an emission rate limit of pounds per gigawatt hour 
if the proposed rule is promulgated  wisconsin public service s current analysis indicates that the emission control equipment on the existing units may be sufficient to achieve the proposed limitation 
new units will require additional mercury control techniques to reduce mercury emissions by to 
mercury control technology is still in development 
wisconsin public service is assessing potential mercury control technologies for application to future new coal fired units 
the interstate air quality rule proposal allows the affected states including wisconsin to either require utilities located in the state to participate in an interstate cap and trade program or meet the state s emission budget for nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide through measures to be determined by the state 
wisconsin has not stated a preference as to which option it would select in the event the rule becomes final 
while the effect of the rule on wisconsin public service s facilities is uncertain for planning purposes  it is assumed that additional nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide controls will be needed on existing units or the existing units will need to be converted to natural gas by the installation of any controls and or any conversion to natural gas will need to be scheduled as part of wisconsin public service s long term maintenance plan for its existing units 
as such  controls or conversions may need to take place before the proposed compliance date 
on a preliminary basis and assuming controls or conversion is required  wisconsin public service estimates a cost of million in order to meet a compliance date 
this estimate is based on costs of current control technology 
the generation assets of wps power development are subject to regulations on sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions similar to those that apply to wisconsin public service 
in addition  the sunbury generation facilities of wps power development are located in an ozone transport region 
as a result  these generation facilities are subject to additional restrictions on emissions of nitrogen oxide 
although wps power development has some emission allowances for for the sunbury facility  it may need to purchase approximately  to  additional allowances at market rates  to meet its requirements 
energy and capacity prices prices for electric energy and capacity have been extremely volatile over the past three years 
wps resources nonregulated entities are impacted by this volatility  which has been driven by the exit of many of the largest speculative traders  the slow down in the economy  and significant overbuilding of generation capacity 
although electric energy prices are currently high due to increased natural gas prices  we expect that electric capacity prices will continue to be depressed for several years 
pressure on capacity prices will continue until existing reserve margins are depleted either by load growth or capacity retirements 
wps power development has been negatively impacted by the depressed capacity prices and volatile energy prices discussed above  and as a result we have taken certain steps to reduce our exposure to the merchant marketplace 
on october   a definitive agreement was signed to sell wps power development s sunbury generating facility to a subsidiary of duquesne light holdings 
the pending sale will allow us to reduce uncontracted merchant exposure and redeploy capital into markets with different risk profiles 
in addition  in january  wps power development entered into an agreement to lease most of its generation relating to continuing operations to wps energy services 
wps energy services will utilize various financial tools  including forwards and options  to limit exposure and extract additional value from volatile commodity prices 
synthetic fuel operation we have significantly reduced our consolidated federal income tax liability for the past four years through tax credits available to us under section of the internal revenue code for the production and sale of solid synthetic fuel from coal 
in order to maximize the value of our synthetic fuel production facility  we have reduced our interest in the facility from to through sales to third parties see note  acquisitions and sales of assets 
our ability to fully utilize the section tax credits that remain available to us in connection with our remaining interest in the facility will depend on whether the amount of our federal income tax liability is sufficient to permit the use of such credits 
the internal revenue service strictly enforces compliance with all of the technical requirements of section section tax credits are currently scheduled to expire at the end of on june   the internal revenue service announced that it had reason to question the scientific validity of certain test procedures and results that have been presented by certain taxpayers to qualify for section credits 
the internal revenue service also announced that it was reviewing information regarding these test procedures and practices 
however  on october   the internal revenue service announced that it had closed its investigation and concluded that such tests and procedures were scientifically valid if properly applied and indicated it would issue additional guidance on future sampling and testing 
wps resources believes that its synthetic fuel facility does and will comply with such guidelines 
as a result of the june internal revenue service announcement  on august   wps resources received notice from the internal revenue service that the wps resources affiliate through which it holds an ownership interest in a synthetic fuel facility was under review for the tax period and that  depending upon the review of the affiliate s tax return  the internal revenue service might reexamine the affiliate s tax return 
however  following the october announcement that the internal revenue service was closing its investigation  wps resources received preliminary notice in january that both audits related to this issue have closed without adjustment 
future years remain open to audit 
we continue to believe that the facility has been operated in compliance with the requirements of section the permanent subcommittee on investigations of the senate committee on governmental affairs has been conducting an investigation of the synthetic fuel industry and their use of section tax credits 
pursuant to its invitation  on january   we answered questions of the committee regarding our synthetic fuel facility 
it is not known when the investigation will be completed and what impact  if any  such investigation may have on future legislation or the enforcement policy of the internal revenue service 
we have recorded approximately million of section tax credits as reductions of income tax expense from the project s inception in june through december  as a result of alternative minimum tax rules  about million of this tax benefit has been carried forward as a deferred tax asset as of december  future payments under one of the agreements covering the sale of a portion of our interest in the facility are contingent on the facility s continued production of synthetic fuel 
any disallowance of some or all of those tax credits would materially affect the related deferred tax account  as well as future tax obligations 
additionally  such disallowances may also result in a reduction of the level of synthetic fuel production at the facility  thus reducing the likelihood and amount of future payments under that agreement 
future tax legislation and internal revenue service review may also affect the value of the credits and the value of our share of the facility 
industry restructuring to the extent competitive pressures increase and the pricing and sale of electricity assumes more of the characteristics of a commodity business  the economics of our business may come under increasing pressure 
in addition  regulatory changes may increase access to electric transmission grids by utility and nonutility purchasers and sellers of electricity  thus potentially resulting in a significant number of additional competitors in wholesale power generation 
deregulation of the electric and natural gas utilities has begun in wisconsin  particularly for natural gas service 
currently  the largest natural gas customers can purchase natural gas from suppliers other than their local utility 
efforts are underway to make it easier for smaller natural gas customers to do the same 
in addition  the public service commission of wisconsin has been studying how to deregulate the state s electric supply 
we believe electric deregulation inside wisconsin is at least several years off as the state is focused on improving reliability by building more generation and transmission facilities and creating fair market rules 
as electric choice occurs  we believe we will lose some generation load  which could negatively impact future cash flows  but will retain the delivery revenues and margin 
also  the capacity that is freed up should be competitive in our marketplace 
deregulation of electricity is present in michigan  however  no customers have chosen an alternative electric supplier and no alternative electric suppliers have offered to serve any customers in michigan s upper peninsula due to the lack of transmission capacity in the areas we serve  which is a barrier to competitive suppliers entering the market 
in february the michigan public service commission issued an interim order providing electric rate relief to detroit edison in a manner that could negatively impact the competitive electric supply market in the area served by this utility 
as a result of the interim order  customers of competitive electric suppliers will experience a decrease in cost savings compared to the bundled utility rate  potentially making electric choice less attractive to energy consumers 
wps energy services serves customers in the impacted area and therefore the interim order could negatively impact future electric revenues and margins at this business 
we will work to obtain modifications to the interim order as the final rate order is not expected until september new accounting pronouncements impact of issue on wps energy services revenues as required  on january   wps energy services adopted issue no 
upon adoption  issue required revenues related to derivative instruments classified as trading to be reported net of related cost of sales for all periods presented 
prior to january   wps energy services classified all its activities as trading in accordance with the accounting standards in effect at that time 
consistent with the new accounting standards under issue  effective january   wps energy services classifies as trading activities only those transactions that at inception are intended to be settled in the near term with the objective of generating profits on short term differences in prices 
as a result of the change in the definition of trading  a larger portion of wps energy services business activities were classified as trading in than in therefore  previously reported revenues for and have been reclassified to be shown net of cost of fuel  natural gas  and purchased power  while most revenues continue to be reported on a gross basis 
the retroactive reclassification to net revenues and cost of sales for and trading activities resulted in a  million and  million decrease to wps resources previously reported consolidated nonregulated revenues  respectively  and a corresponding  million and  million decrease to previously reported consolidated nonregulated cost of fuel  natural gas  and purchased power for the years ended december  and  respectively 
neither margins  income  nor cash flows for were impacted by the reclassification of revenue upon adoption of issue asset retirement obligations effective january   wps resources adopted statement no 
under the new accounting standard  wps resources recognizes  at fair value  legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  or development and or normal operation of the asset 
the associated retirement costs are capitalized as part of the related long lived asset and depreciated over their useful life 
legal retirement obligations identified for the regulated segments of wps resources relate primarily to the final decommissioning of the kewaunee nuclear power plant 
the nonregulated segments identified a legal retirement obligation related to the closure of an ash basin located at the sunbury generation plant 
the adoption of statement no 
had no impact on the earnings or cash flows of the regulated segment as the effects were offset by the establishment of regulatory assets and liabilities pursuant to statement no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  and reduced earnings of the nonregulated segment by million  recorded as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
upon implementation of statement no 
in the first quarter of  we recorded a net asset retirement cost of million decreased to million at december  due to depreciation being recorded and an asset retirement obligation of million upon adoption of statement no 
increased to million at december  as a result of accretion being recorded 
the difference between previously recorded liabilities of million and the cumulative effect of adopting statement no 
was deferred to a regulatory liability pursuant to statement no 
costs of removal the utility segments of wps resources recognize removal costs for utility assets 
historically  these removal costs were reflected as a component of depreciation expense and accumulated depreciation in accordance with regulatory treatment 
the staff of the securities and exchange commission recently expressed their views on the balance sheet classification of these costs of removal and required that the amounts be reclassified from accumulated depreciation to a liability 
as a result  wps resources reclassified million of removal costs from accumulated depreciation to nuclear decommissioning and other costs of removal at december  wps resources identified legal retirement obligations associated with the removal of certain utility assets upon implementation of statement no 
in january upon the adoption of statement no 
on january   costs of removal with associated legal obligations of million were removed from nuclear decommissioning and other costs of removal as these costs are now accounted for as asset retirement obligations 
costs of removal that were not identified as having an associated legal retirement obligation were reclassified from nuclear decommissioning and other costs of removal to a regulatory liability at december  income available for common shareholders and cash flows were not impacted by this accounting change 
variable interest entities in january  the financial accounting standards board issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
 in order to improve financial reporting by companies involved with variable interest entities 
interpretation no 
requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
on december   the financial accounting standards board issued a revision to interpretation no 
r in order to clarify some of the provisions of interpretation no 
and to exempt certain entities from its requirements 
the effective implementation date of interpretation no 
was also modified by interpretation no 
r 
the application of interpretation no 
r was required for financial statements of public entities that have interests in special purpose entities for periods ending after december  wps resources identified wpsr capital trust i as a special purpose entity that is within the scope of interpretation no 
r 
see note  company obligated mandatorily redeemable trust preferred securities of preferred stock trust  for further discussion of the impacts of implementing this portion of interpretation no 
r on the financial statement of wps resources 
for all other types of variable interest entities  the application of interpretation no 
r will be required in the first quarter of we do not anticipate a significant impact to the financial statements of wps resources in the first quarter of as a result of adopting the remaining provisions of interpretation no 
r 
medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of in january  the financial accounting standards board issued staff position fsp  accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of fsp permits a sponsor of a postretirement health care plan that provides a prescription drug benefit to make a one time election to defer accounting for the effects of the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of  which was signed into law on december  regardless of whether a sponsor elects that deferral  the fsp required certain disclosures pending further consideration of the underlying accounting issues 
in accordance with fsp  we have elected to defer accounting for the effects of this legislation until authoritative guidance on the accounting for the legislation is issued 
refer to note of wps resources notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
impact of inflation wps resources our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and report operating results in terms of historic cost 
the statements provide a reasonable  objective  and quantifiable statement of financial results  but they do not evaluate the impact of inflation 
under rate treatment prescribed by utility regulatory commissions  wisconsin public service s and upper peninsula power s projected operating costs are recoverable in revenues 
because rate forecasting assumes inflation  most of the inflationary effects on normal operating costs are recoverable in rates 
however  in these forecasts  wisconsin public service and upper peninsula power are only allowed to recover the historic cost of plant via depreciation 
results of operations wisconsin public service corporation wisconsin public service corporation is a regulated electric and natural gas utility as well as a holding company exempt from the public utility holding company act of electric operations accounted for approximately of revenues in  while gas operations contributed to revenues 
compared with wisconsin public service corporation overview wisconsin public service s and results of operations are shown in the following table wisconsin public service s results millions change operating revenues earnings on common stock wisconsin retail electric and wholesale electric rate increases together with higher natural gas prices contributed to the increase in operating revenues in earnings from electric utility operations were million in compared with million in earnings from gas utility operations were million in compared with million in the decrease in electric earnings at wisconsin public service was attributable to a delay in receiving retail electric rate relief  together with rising operating expenses primarily pension and medical costs 
rate relief for these increasing operating costs was expected on january   however  the increase in retail electric rates granted by the public service commission of wisconsin was not effective until march  the decrease in gas utility earnings is also due to rising operating expenses  together with a decrease in the natural gas rates allowed by the public service commission of wisconsin in compared to electric utility operations electric utility results millions change revenues fuel and purchased power margins sales in kilowatt hours electric utility revenues increased million  or  in compared to the increase is largely due to retail and wholesale electric rate increases for the wisconsin and michigan customers in accordance with new rate orders 
due primarily to the electric rate increases  electric margins at wisconsin public service increased million  or  in electric margins were also impacted favorably by a change in sales mix in while total sales volumes remained basically unchanged in compared to  sales volumes to higher margin residential and commercial and industrial customers increased slightly 
the increase in sales volumes to these higher margin customer classes reflects growth within wisconsin public service s service area and recent changes in the economy 
these increases were partially offset by cooler weather during the cooling season for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the public service commission of wisconsin allows wisconsin public service to adjust prospectively the amount billed to wisconsin retail customers for fuel and purchased power if costs fall outside a specified range 
wisconsin public service is required to file an application to adjust rates either higher or lower when costs are plus or minus from forecasted costs on an annualized basis

wisconsin public service passes changes in the cost of gas on to customers through a purchased gas adjustment clause  as allowed by the public service commission of wisconsin and the michigan public service commission under current regulatory practice 
other expenses income utility operating and maintenance expense increased million  or  for the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
approximately million of the increase reflects higher pension  postretirement medical and active medical costs 
the remaining increase pertains to costs incurred for plant maintenance related to the kewaunee nuclear power plant s scheduled refueling outage in there was no refueling outage in  additional operating expenses at the kewaunee nuclear power plant and wage increases 
utility depreciation and decommissioning expense increased million  or  for the year ended december  compared to the prior year  mostly related to an increase of million resulting from higher realized gains on the decommissioning trust assets that resulted in recording decommissioning expense approximately equal to the gains recognized in miscellaneous income pursuant to regulatory practice 
the remaining increase is related to plant asset additions 
other utility income increased in  largely due to an increase in realized gains on the decommissioning trust assets of million 
the realized gains were offset by increased decommissioning expense  as discussed above 
other nonutility income other nonutility income increased in  largely due to an increase in gains recognized on hydroelectric land sales in compared to primarily due to the million pre tax gain recognized in from land sales to the wisconsin department of natural resources 
earnings from equity method investments also increased in compared to compared with wisconsin public service corporation overview wisconsin public service s and results of operations are shown in the following table wisconsin public service s results millions change operating revenues earnings on common stock sales volume growth and wisconsin retail rate increases contributed to increased revenues in earnings from electric utility operations were million in compared with million in earnings from gas utility operations were million in compared with million in a full year contribution from gas utility operations acquired in the spring of  warmer than normal weather during the heating season in  and a rate increase approved by regulators resulted in increased earnings from gas utility operations in utility margins at wisconsin public service were impacted positively by a public service commission of wisconsin interim rate order which was effective january  authorizing a increase in wisconsin retail electric rates and a increase in wisconsin retail natural gas rates 
in late june  wisconsin public service received a final rate order  which authorized a increase in wisconsin retail electric rates and a increase in wisconsin retail natural gas rates 
the final order authorized a lower retail natural gas rate increase than was approved in the interim order resulting in a million refund to wisconsin public service s natural gas customers

increased fuel costs for power generation were partially offset by lower purchased power expenses 
wisconsin public service s fuel expense for generation plants increased million  or  in wisconsin public service s purchased power expense  however  decreased million  or  in overall generation from wisconsin public service s plants increased while purchased volumes decreased 
the change in the energy supply mix was largely due to the availability of less expensive power generation from the kewaunee nuclear power plant 
wisconsin public service increased its ownership interest in the kewaunee nuclear power plant to in september the public service commission of wisconsin allows wisconsin public service to adjust prospectively the amount billed to wisconsin retail customers for fuel and purchased power if costs fall outside a specified range

utility depreciation and decommissioning expense increased million in largely due to additional plant assets at wisconsin public service  including its increased ownership interest in the kewaunee nuclear power plant 
lower depreciation expense of million in related to decreased decommissioning earnings partially offset the increased plant asset depreciation 
other utility income decreased in primarily as the result of lower earnings of million on wisconsin public service s nuclear decommissioning trust assets 
due to regulatory practice  a decrease in earnings on the trust assets is largely offset by decreased depreciation expense 
other nonutility income hydroelectric land sales resulted in pretax gains of million at wisconsin public service in compared with pretax gains of approximately million in in addition  earnings on equity investments were higher in compared with primarily due to the investment in american transmission company

wisconsin public service adopted statement no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  effective january   and as a result  capitalized a net asset retirement cost of million decreased to million at december  due to depreciation 
the remaining increase in property  plant  and equipment primarily relates to capital expenditures for the pulliam combustion turbine  and gas and electric distribution equipment 
the staff of the securities and exchange commission recently expressed their views on the balance sheet classification of costs of removal for the utility industry and required that the amounts be reclassified from accumulated depreciation to a liability 
as a result  wps resources reclassified costs of removal out of accumulated deprecation at december  and see trends wps resources for more information about these accounting changes 
gas in storage increased million at december  compared to december  largely due to a increase in the average price of natural gas experienced in compared to investments and other assets increased million at december  compared to december  as a result of the recognition of an intangible pension asset related to the minimum pension liability we recorded at december  and additional investments in american transmission company 
accounts payable decreased million at december  compared to december  largely due to a million payable that was recorded at december  resulting from the purchase of the de pere energy center

liquidity and capital resources wisconsin public service wisconsin public service believes that its cash  operating cash flows  and borrowing ability because of strong credit ratings  when taken together  provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements and future capital expenditures related to expansion of existing businesses and development of new projects 
however  the company s operating cash flow and access to capital markets can be impacted by macroeconomic factors outside its control 
in addition  the company s borrowing costs can be impacted by its short and long term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies  which in part are based on certain credit measures such as interest coverage and leverage ratios 
currently  we believe these ratings continue to be among the best in the energy industry see financing cash flows  credit ratings below 
operating cash flows during  net cash provided by operating activities was million  compared with million in the decrease was primarily due to increased working capital requirements 
gas inventories increased million due to high natural gas prices 
receivables and accrued revenues also increased due to higher natural gas prices 
during  net cash provided by operating activities was million  compared with million in the increase was primarily attributed to an increase in net income after adjustment for certain non cash items  as working capital changes were not significant 
investing cash flows net cash used for investing activities was million in compared to million in the small decrease is attributed to a decrease in capital expenditures and an increase in the sale of property  plant  and equipment of million 
these factors were partially offset by an increase in the purchase of equity investments and other acquisitions of million 
see asset sales and acquisitions below for further detail 
net cash used for investing activities was million in compared to million in  an increase of million 
the increase was primarily the result of an increase in capital expenditures discussed within capital expenditures below  as well as a decrease in dividends received from equity method investment due to a decrease in the return of capital from the american transmission company  and a decrease in the sale of property  plant  and equipment 
the decrease in the sale of property  plant  and equipment is primarily due to the sale of land on the peshtigo river in northeastern wisconsin to the wisconsin department of natural resources 
asset sales and acquisitions certain acquisitions and asset sales that have a significant impact on investing cash flows are discussed below 
in addition  see note  acquisitions and sales of assets for a more detailed discussion of asset sales and acquisitions 
on december   wisconsin public service sold an additional acres of land near the peshtigo river to the wisconsin department of natural resources for million as part of a multi phase agreement reached between the parties in under the terms of the agreement  the wisconsin department of natural resources bought more than  acres of land for million in on april   the public service commission of wisconsin approved wisconsin public service s request to transfer its interest in the wausau  wisconsin  to duluth  minnesota  transmission line to the american transmission company 
american transmission company is a for profit transmission only company created by the transfer of transmission assets previously owned by multiple electric utilities serving the upper midwest in exchange for an ownership interest in american transmission company 
wisconsin public service sold approximately million of assets at book value related to the wausau to duluth transmission line to american transmission company in june no gain or loss was recognized on the transaction

on december   wisconsin public service purchased the megawatt de pere energy center for million and terminated the related existing purchased power agreement 
wisconsin public service paid million at the close of the transaction and the remaining million in december capital expenditures capital expenditures by business segment for the years ended december    and are as follows millions years ended december  electric utility gas utility other wpsc consolidated capital expenditures in the electric utility were higher in compared to mainly due to construction of portions of the pulliam combustion turbine at wisconsin public service in gas utility capital expenditures increased due to the installation of automated meter reading in as part of its regulated utility operations  on september  wisconsin public service submitted an application for a certificate of public convenience and necessity to the public service commission of wisconsin seeking approval to build a megawatt coal fired generation facility near wausau  wisconsin 
the facility is estimated to cost approximately million including the acquisition of coal trains  assuming the public service commission of wisconsin allows a current return on construction costs

in its rate order  the public service commission of wisconsin authorized deferral of costs related to development of the facility 
on november   wisconsin public service received a declaratory ruling allowing recovery of all reasonable costs up to million related to the project incurred or committed to prior to the public service commission of wisconsin s final decision regarding construction authorization 
in addition  wisconsin public service expects to incur additional construction costs of approximately million to fund construction of the transmission facilities required to support the generating facility through the date the generating facility goes into service 
american transmission company will reimburse wisconsin public service for the construction costs of the interconnection and related carrying costs when the generation facility becomes commercially operational

on february   wisconsin public service signed a letter of intent with dairyland power cooperative for electric supply alternatives for megawatts of energy from the proposed megawatt coal fired generation facility 
according to the agreement  dairyland could choose to purchase an interest in the plant or buy electricity from it we have since received written notification from dairyland  confirming their intent to purchase an interest in the plant 
in providing dairyland with electric supply alternatives  wisconsin public service can reduce the risks associated with building and operating the power plant 
the agreement is part of wisconsin public service s continuing plan to provide least cost reliable energy for the increasing electric demand of its customers 
this transaction is subject to a number of conditions including successfully developing a joint plant ownership and operating agreement  dairyland obtaining financing approval from the rural utility services  and dairyland securing firm transmission service from the midwest independent system operator on terms and conditions dairyland deems acceptable 
capital expenditures at the electric utility were million higher in compared to  mostly related to the steam generator replacement at the kewaunee nuclear power plant and the acquisition of madison gas and electric company s interest in the kewaunee nuclear power plant including its decommissioning trust assets 
in the gas utility segment  capital expenditures increased million in from  partially due to the installation of automated meter reading 
the remaining increase is attributed to various one time projects that occurred in financing cash flows net cash provided by financing activities was million in compared to cash used for financing activities of million in wisconsin public service required cash from financing activities in as cash provided by operating activities was not adequate to fund investing activities 
wisconsin public service s financing activities used cash of million in and provided cash of million in cash was not required from financing activities in due to strong operating cash flows 
significant financing activities as of december   wisconsin public service was in compliance with all of the covenants under its line of credit and its other debt obligations 
wisconsin public service established a day credit line syndication for million  during the third quarter of the prior credit line syndication was for million 
the credit line is used to back of wisconsin public service s commercial paper borrowing program

wisconsin public service corporation  under a registration statement declared effective in  issued million of year senior notes in december the senior notes are collateralized by a pledge of first mortgage bonds and may become non collateralized if wisconsin public service retires all of its outstanding first mortgage bonds 
the net proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes were used to call million of first mortgage bonds on january   fund construction costs and capital additions  reduce short term indebtedness  and for other corporate utility purposes 
wisconsin public service used short term debt to retire million of first mortgage bonds on february  that had reached maturity and also retired million of tax exempt bonds on may  wisconsin public service is evaluating the potential for refinancing existing debt in wisconsin public service issued million of year senior notes in december the senior notes are collateralized by a pledge of first mortgage bonds and may become non collateralized if wisconsin public service retires all of its outstanding first mortgage bonds 
wisconsin public service used approximately million of the net proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes to acquire the de pere energy center and million to retire short term debt 
the balance of the net proceeds was used for other corporate utility purposes 
credit ratings wisconsin public service uses internally generated funds and commercial paper borrowing to satisfy most of its capital requirements 
wisconsin public service also periodically issues long term debt  receives equity contributions from wps resources  and makes payments for return of capital to wps resources to reduce short term debt  fund future growth  and maintain capitalization ratios as authorized by the public service commission of wisconsin 
the current credit ratings for wisconsin public service are listed in the table below 
credit ratings standard poor s moody s wisconsin public service corporation bonds preferred stock commercial paper credit line syndication aa a a aa a p aa in november  moody s downgraded its long term credit ratings for wisconsin public service one ratings level  leaving only commercial paper ratings unchanged 
moody s downgrade of wisconsin public service is based on the expectation that the utility s substantial capital spending program will exceed its retained cash flow through  which is likely to lead to a meaningful increase in debt 
following the downgrade  moody s set the ratings outlook at stable for wisconsin public service 
we believe these ratings continue to be among the best in the utility industry  and allow us to access commercial paper and long term debt markets on favorable terms 
credit ratings are not recommendations to buy  are subject to change  and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 
rating agencies use a number of both quantitative and qualitative measures in determining a company s credit rating 
these measures include business risk  liquidity risk  competitive position  capital mix  financial condition  predictability of cash flows  management strength  regulatory risk  and future direction 
some of the quantitative measures can be analyzed through a few key financial ratios  while the qualitative ones are more subjective 
wisconsin public service holds a credit line to back of its commercial paper borrowing 
this credit facility is based on a credit rating of a p a decrease in the commercial paper credit rating could adversely affect the company by increasing the interest rates at which it can borrow and potentially limiting the availability of funds to the company through the commercial paper market 
a restriction in the company s ability to use commercial paper borrowing to meet its working capital needs could require it to secure funds through alternate sources resulting in higher interest expense  higher credit line fees  and a potential delay in the availability of funds

for more information regarding the kewaunee sale  see the discussion below 
other future considerations kewaunee nuclear power plant on november   wisconsin public service and wisconsin power and light company entered into a definitive agreement to sell the kewaunee nuclear power plant to a subsidiary of dominion resources  inc wisconsin public service is a owner of the kewaunee nuclear power plant 
the transaction is subject to approval from various regulatory agencies  including the public service commission of wisconsin  the federal energy regulatory commission  the nuclear regulatory commission  and several other state utility regulatory agencies and is projected to close in approval has already been obtained from the iowa public utility commission 
wisconsin public service estimates that its share of the cash proceeds from the sale will approximate million  subject to various post closing adjustments 
the cash proceeds from the sale are expected to slightly exceed the carrying value of the wisconsin public service assets being sold 
in addition to the cash proceeds  wisconsin public service will retain ownership of the assets contained in its non qualified decommissioning trust  one of two funds that were established to cover the eventual decommissioning of the kewaunee nuclear power plant 
the pretax fair value of the non qualified decommissioning trust s assets at december  was million 
dominion will assume responsibility for the eventual decommissioning of kewaunee and will receive wisconsin public service s qualified decommissioning trust assets that had a fair value of million at december  wisconsin public service will request deferral of the gain expected to result from this transaction and related costs from the public service commission of wisconsin 
accordingly  the gain on the sale of the plant assets and the related non qualified decommissioning trust assets is expected to be returned to customers under future rate orders 
regulatory wisconsin effective march   wisconsin public service received approval to increase wisconsin retail electric rates million and decrease wisconsin retail natural gas rates million 
the retail electric and natural gas rates reflect a return on equity and allowed average equity of in the utility s capital structure 
on april   wisconsin public service filed an application with the public service commission of wisconsin for authorization to increase retail electric and natural gas rates  effective january  the rate increases are necessary to recover the costs associated with the purchase of the de pere energy center  fuel costs  maintenance of power production facilities and employee benefits 
on december   the public service commission of wisconsin issued a final written order authorizing a retail electric rate increase of million and a retail natural gas rate increase of million  effective january  the rates reflect a return on equity 
the public service commission of wisconsin also approved average equity of in the utility s capital structure 
the amount of fuel and purchased power costs wisconsin public service is authorized to recover in rates is established in its general rate filings 
if the actual fuel and purchased power costs vary from the authorized level by more than on an annual basis  wisconsin public service is allowed  or may be required  to file an application adjusting rates for the remainder of the year to reflect actual costs for the year to date and updated projected costs 
on october   wisconsin public service filed to reduce rates by million  due to a reduction in the costs of fuel and purchased power  for the period august  through december  on february   the public service commission of wisconsin approved a refund of million  which represents the originally filed amounts  adjustments  and interest 
this refund will be credited to customer accounts in march a liability of million was accrued as of december  in anticipation of this refund 
as a result of the kewaunee nuclear power plant unplanned outage in late january and early february  and other fuel cost increases in  the wisconsin public service filed for a fuel cost increase of million on february  the public service commission of wisconsin has scheduled a hearing for march  to determine the amount of the fuel cost increase to be recorded on an interim basis 
wisconsin public service expects that a final order will be issued in summer regarding this increase 
michigan wisconsin public service filed for an increase in retail electric rates in the first quarter of on july   the michigan public service commission authorized an increase in retail electric rates of million and the recovery of an additional million of transmission costs through the power supply cost recovery mechanism  effective july  federal on april   wisconsin public service received a draft order from the federal energy regulatory commission approving a  or million  increase in wholesale electric rates 
the new wholesale rates were effective on may   and are subject to refund if the final rate increase is less 
the draft order also granted the use of formula rates  which allow for the adjustment of wholesale electric rates to reflect actual costs without having to file additional rate requests 
on march   the federal energy regulatory commission and wisconsin public service reached a tentative settlement regarding the final rate increase 
wisconsin public service anticipates no material refunds or other adjustments to revenues recorded under the interim rates based on the terms of the tentative agreement 
the final settlement is anticipated to be filed with the federal energy regulatory commission in the second quarter of this was wisconsin public service s first rate increase for its wholesale electric customers in years 
off balance sheet arrangements wisconsin public service see wps resources management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for information regarding off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies wisconsin public service in may  the securities and exchange commission issued proposed rules regarding the identification and disclosure of accounting estimates a company makes in applying its accounting policies and the disclosure of initial adoption by a company of an accounting policy that has a material impact on its financial presentation 
under the first part of the proposal  a company would have to identify the accounting estimates reflected in its financial statements that required it to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time of estimation 
disclosures about those estimates would then be required if different estimates that the company reasonably could have used in the current period  or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  would have a material impact on the presentation of the company s financial condition  changes in financial condition or results of operations 
the securities and exchange commission accepted comments on the proposed rules through july  and has not made any final decisions since that time 
in anticipation of at least parts of this proposed rule being made final  we have identified the following accounting policies to be critical to the understanding of our financial statements because their application requires significant judgment and reliance on estimations of matters that are inherently uncertain 
risk management activities in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  wisconsin public service records its derivatives at fair value 
these amounts are calculated using estimates that are critical to the financial statements 
fair value of the derivatives is calculated using internal models  third party quotes  or a combination of the two methods 
changes in the expected electric and gas market prices could cause variability in the fair values of the derivatives 
because wisconsin public service has regulatory approval to offset the changes in the fair value of derivatives with a regulatory asset or liability  such changes would be reflected on the consolidated balance sheets only 
asset impairment the merger of wisconsin fuel and light into wisconsin public service in resulted in wisconsin public service recording goodwill related to its gas utility segment 
the goodwill is tested for impairment yearly based on the guidance of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the test for impairment includes assumptions about future profitability of the gas utility segment and the correlation between the gas utility segment and published projections for other similar gas utility segments 
a significant change in the gas utility market and or internal projections of future profitability could result in a loss being recorded on the income statement related to a decrease in the goodwill asset  as a result of the impairment test 
revenues wisconsin public service accrues estimated amounts of revenue for services rendered but not yet billed based on estimated unbilled sales 
estimated unbilled sales are calculated using actual generation and throughput volumes  recorded sales and weather factors 
the estimated unbilled sales are assigned different rates based on historical customer class allocations 
any difference between actual sales and the estimates or weather factors would cause a change in the estimated revenue 
accruals for pension and postretirement benefits wisconsin public service estimates its benefit obligations using assumptions about discount rates  future salary increases  expected returns on plan assets  and medical and dental cost trend rates 
these assumptions are disclosed annually in our annual report on form k in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
changes in the economy can cause adjustments in the assumptions used to calculate the benefit obligations and would affect the related liabilities and expenses 
for a more detailed sensitivity analysis see wps resources management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
regulatory accounting the electric and gas utility segments of wisconsin public service follow statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  and our financial statements reflect the effects of the different ratemaking principles followed by the various jurisdictions regulating these segments 
we defer certain items that would otherwise be immediately recognized as expenses and revenues because our regulators have authorized deferral as regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities for future recovery or refund to customers 
future recovery of regulatory assets is not assured  but are generally subject to review by regulators in rate proceedings for matters such as prudence and reasonableness 
management regularly assesses whether these regulatory assets and liabilities are probable of future recovery or refund by considering factors such as regulatory environment changes and the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation 
once approved  we reduce regulatory assets and liabilities by recognition in income over the rate recovery period 
if not approved  these regulatory assets or liabilities would be recognized in income in the then current period 
if our electric and gas utility segments no longer meet the criteria for applying statement no 
 we would discontinue its application as defined under statement no 
 regulated enterprises accounting for the discontinuation of application of fasb statement no 
assets and liabilities recognized solely due to the actions of rate regulation may no longer be recognized on the balance sheet and would be classified as an extraordinary item in income for the period in which the discontinuation occurs 
a write off of all wisconsin public service s regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities at december   would result in a decrease in total assets  a decrease in total liabilities  and a increase in income before taxes 
related party transactions wisconsin public service wisconsin public service has investments in related parties that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
these include the investment at wps investments  llc  a consolidated subsidiary of wps resources  in american transmission company llc  guardian pipeline  llc  and wisconsin river power company 
wisconsin public service also enters into transactions with upper peninsula power and wps energy services  which are both wholly owned subsidiaries of wps resources 
american transmission company  llc is a for profit  transmission only company that owns  plans  maintains  monitors and operates electric transmission assets in portions of wisconsin  michigan  and illinois

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks wps resources has potential market risk exposures related to commodity price risk  interest rate risk  equity return  and principal preservation risk 
the current exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk is not significant 
wps resources has risk management policies in place to monitor and assist in controlling these market risks and may use derivative and other instruments to manage some of these exposures 
interest rate risk wps resources and wisconsin public service are exposed to interest rate risk resulting from their variable rate long term debt and short term commercial paper borrowing 
exposure to interest rate risk is managed by limiting the amount of variable rate obligations and continually monitoring the effects of market changes in interest rates 
wps resources and wisconsin public service enter into long term fixed rate debt when it is advantageous to do so 
wps resources and wisconsin public service may also enter into derivative financial instruments  such as swaps  to mitigate interest rate exposure 
at december  and  wps resources utilized one interest rate swap to fix the interest rate on a variable rate loan at one of its nonregulated subsidiaries 
based on the variable rate debt of wps resources and wisconsin public service outstanding at december   a hypothetical increase in market interest rates of basis points in would increase annual interest expense by approximately million and million  respectively 
comparatively  based on the variable rate debt outstanding at december   an increase in interest rates of basis points would have increased interest expense in by approximately million and million 
these amounts were determined by performing a sensitivity analysis on the impact of a hypothetical basis points increase in interest rates on the variable rate debt of wps resources and wisconsin public service outstanding as of december  and this sensitivity analysis was performed assuming a constant level of variable rate debt during the period and an immediate increase in the levels of interest rates with no other subsequent changes for the remainder of the period 
in the event of a significant change in interest rates  management would take action to mitigate wps resources and wisconsin public service s exposure to the change 
commodity price risk wps resources is exposed to commodity price risk resulting from the impact of market fluctuations in the price of certain commodities  including but not limited to electricity  natural gas  coal  fuel oil  and uranium  which are used and or sold by our subsidiaries in the normal course of their business 
we employ established policies and procedures to reduce the market risk associated with changing commodity prices  including using various types of commodity and derivative instruments 
wps resources exposure to commodity price risk in its regulated utilities is significantly mitigated by the current ratemaking process for the recovery of its electric fuel and purchased energy costs as well as its cost of natural gas purchased for resale 
therefore  the value at risk amounts discussed below do not include measures for wps resources regulated utilities 
to further manage commodity price risk  our regulated utilities enter into contracts of various durations for the purchase and or sale of natural gas  fuel for electric generation  and electricity 
wps power development utilizes purchase and or sale contracts for electric fuel and electricity to help manage its commodity price risk 
wps energy services uses derivative financial and commodity instruments to reduce market risk associated with the changing prices of natural gas and electricity sold at firm prices to customers 
wps energy services also utilizes these instruments to manage market risk associated with anticipated energy purchases 
for purposes of risk management disclosure  wps power development s and wps energy services activities are classified as non trading 
the value at risk amounts discussed below are presented separately for both wps power development and wps energy services due to the differing market and timing exposures of each entity 
value at risk to measure commodity price risk exposure  wps resources performs a value at risk var analysis of its exposures 
var is used to describe a probabilistic approach to quantifying the exposure to market risk 
the var amount represents an estimate of the potential change in fair value that could occur from changes in market factors  within a given confidence level  if an instrument or portfolio is held for a specified time period 
var models are relatively sophisticated 
however  the quantitative risk information is limited by the parameters established in creating the model 
the instruments being used may have features that could trigger a potential loss in excess of the calculated amount if the changes in the underlying commodity price exceed the confidence level of the model used 
var is not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur 
var is estimated using a delta normal approximation based on a one day holding period and a confidence level 
the delta normal approximation is based on the assumption that changes in the value of the portfolio over short time periods  such as one day  are normally distributed 
it does not take into account higher order risk exposures  so it may not provide a good approximation of the risk in a portfolio with substantial option positions 
we utilized a delta normal approximation because our portfolio has limited exposure to optionality 
our var calculation includes derivative financial and commodity instruments  such as forwards  futures  swaps  and options as well as commodities held in inventory  such as natural gas held in storage to the extent such positions are significant 
our var amount for wps energy services was calculated to be million at december  compared to million at december  our var amount for wps power development was calculated to be million at december  compared with million at december  the increase for wps power development was primarily due to increased volatility in our forward price curve for electricity 
a significant portion of this var amount is mitigated by wps power development s generating capabilities  which are excluded from the var calculation as required by the securities and exchange commission rules 
for the year ended december   the average  high  and low var amounts for wps energy services were million  million  and million  respectively 
the same amounts for the year ended december  were million  million  and million 
for the year ended december   the average  high  and low var amounts for wps power development were million  million  and million  respectively 
the same amounts for the year ended december  were million  million  and million 
the average  high  and low amounts were computed using the var amounts at the beginning of the reporting period and the four quarter end amounts 
equity return and principal preservation risk wps resources and wisconsin public service currently fund liabilities related to employee benefits and nuclear decommissioning through various external trust funds 
these funds are managed by various investment managers and hold investments in debt and equity securities 
changes in the market value of these investments can have an impact on the future expenses related to these liabilities 
wps resources maintains two main qualified pension plans 
the pension liability for the non administrative employees retirement plan is currently over funded and no contributions to the plan are required 
the pension liability for the administrative employees retirement plan has risen due to plan design changes and historically low interest rates 
the liability of the administrative employees retirement plan exceeded the value of the plan s assets by million at december  and wps resources was  therefore  required to recognize a minimum pension liability as prescribed by sfas no 
declines in the equity markets or continued declines in interest rates may result in increased future pension costs for these plans and possible future required contributions 
changes in the market value of investments related to other employee benefits or nuclear decommissioning could also impact future contributions 
wps resources monitors the trust fund portfolios by benchmarking the performance of the investments against certain security indices 
all decommissioning costs and most of the employee benefit costs relate to wps resources regulated utilities 
as such  the majority of these costs are recovered in customers rates  mitigating the equity return and principal preservation risk on these exposures 
foreign currency exchange rate risk wps resources is exposed to foreign currency risk as a result of foreign operations owned and operated in canada and transactions denominated in canadian dollars for the purchase and sale of natural gas and electricity by our nonregulated subsidiaries 
forward foreign exchange contracts designated as fair value hedges are utilized to manage the risk associated with currency fluctuations on certain firm sales and sales commitments denominated in canadian dollars and certain canadian dollar denominated asset and liability positions 
wps resources exposure to foreign currency risk was not significant at december  or
