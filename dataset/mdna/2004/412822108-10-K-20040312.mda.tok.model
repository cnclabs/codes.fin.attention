other matters critical accounting policies the company s financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies  which require management to make significant estimates and assumptions 
management believes that the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of accounting policies that currently affect the company s financial condition and results of operations 
finance receivable securitizations the company sells retail motorcycle loans through securitization transactions utilizing qualifying special purpose entities 
upon sale of retail loans in a securitization transaction  hdfs receives cash and retains interest only strip receivables  servicing rights  and cash reserve account deposits  all of which are collectively referred to as retained interests in the securitized receivables 
retained interests are carried at fair value and periodically reviewed for impairment 
market value quotes are generally not available for retained interests  therefore hdfs estimates fair value based on the present value of future expected cash flows using management s best estimates of the key assumptions for credit losses  prepayment speeds and discount rates 
the impact of changes to key assumptions is shown in note of the consolidated financial statements 
gains on current year securitizations from the sale of retail loans are recorded as a component of financial services income and are based in part on certain assumptions including expected credit losses  prepayment speed  and discount rates 
gain on sale also depends on the original carrying amount of the retail loans  which is allocated between the assets sold and the retained interests based on their relative fair value at the date of transfer 
finance receivable credit losses the allowance for uncollectible accounts is maintained at a level management believes is adequate to cover the losses of principal and accrued interest in the existing finance receivables portfolio 
management s periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance is generally based on hdfs past loan loss experience  known and inherent risks in the portfolio  current economic conditions  specific borrower s ability to repay  and the estimated value of any underlying collateral 
pensions and other postretirement benefits retirement plan pension  serpa and post retirement health care obligations and costs are developed from actuarial valuations 
the valuation of projected benefit obligations and net periodic benefit costs relies on key assumptions including discount rates  long term expected return on plan assets  future compensation and medical trend rates 
the company evaluates and updates all of its assumptions annually in conjunction with its september actuarial measurement date 
although the company s process results in assumptions that are valid as of the measurement date  certain assumptions are driven by short term external economic factors  and as result  these assumptions are more volatile 
based on recent economic conditions the company has changed its assumptions for discount rates and medical trend rates 
although the company s retirement plan costs have already been determined in connection with the september  measurement process a change in either of these two assumptions could have a material impact on the valuation of costs as of the company s next measurement date 
the following information is provided to illustrate the sensitivity of these obligations and costs to changes in these major assumptions in thousands 
amounts based on current assumptions impact of a decrease in the discount rate impact of a increase in the medical trend rate net periodic benefit costs pension and serpa n a postretirement healthcare projected benefit obligations pension and serpa n a postretirement healthcare this information is provided only to illustrate the sensitivity of these amounts to certain assumptions and not as a means to predict future amounts 
the calculation of retirement plan obligations and costs is based on many factors in addition to those discussed here 
this information should be considered in combination with the information provided in note to the consolidated financial statements 
contractual obligations a summary of the company s expected payments for significant contractual obligations as of december  is as follows in thousands thereafter total finance debt operating leases as of december   the company had no material purchase obligations other than those created in the ordinary course of business related to inventory and property  plant and equipment which generally have terms of less than days 
the company also has long term obligations related to its pension and postretirement plans which are discussed in detail in note to the financial statements 
as of its most recent actuarial measurement date  no pension plan contributions are required in and postretirement medical claims are paid as they are submitted 
off balance sheet arrangements as part of its securitization program  hdfs transfers retail motorcycle loans to a special purpose bankruptcy remote wholly owned subsidiary 
the subsidiary sells the retail loans to a securitization trust in exchange for the proceeds from asset backed securities issued by the securitization trust 
the asset backed securities  usually notes with various maturities and interest rates  are secured by future collections of the purchased retail installment loans 
activities of the securitization trust are limited to acquiring retail loans  issuing asset backed securities and making payments on securities to investors 
due to the nature of the assets held by the securitization trust and the limited nature of its activities  the securitization trusts are considered qualifying special purpose entities qspes as defined by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
in accordance with sfas no 
 assets and liabilities of the qspes are not consolidated in the financial statements of hdfs 
hdfs does not guarantee securities issued by the securitization trusts or projected cash flows from the related loans purchased from hdfs 
recourse against hdfs related to each securitization transaction is limited to the respective investment in retained securitization interests  excluding servicing rights 
total investment in retained securitization interests at december  is million 
the securitization trusts have a limited life and generally terminate upon final distribution of amounts owed to the investors in the asset backed securities 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of hdfs securitization program 
commitments and contingencies the company is subject to lawsuits and other claims related to environmental  product and other matters 
in determining required reserves related to these items  the company carefully analyzes cases and considers the likelihood of adverse judgments or outcomes  as well as the potential range of probable loss 
the required reserves are monitored on an on going basis and are updated based on new developments or new information in each matter 
in january  the company  on its own initiative  notified each owner of and early model year harley davidson motorcycles equipped with twin cam and twin cam b engines that the company was extending the warranty for a rear cam bearing to years or  miles 
subsequently  on june   a putative nationwide class action was filed against the company in state court in milwaukee county  wisconsin  which was amended by a complaint filed september  the complaint alleged that this cam bearing is defective and asserted various legal theories 
the complaint sought unspecified compensatory and punitive damages for affected owners  an order compelling the company to repair the engines  and other relief 
on february   the company s motion to dismiss the amended complaint was granted by the court and the amended complaint was dismissed in its entirety 
an appeal was filed with the wisconsin court of appeals

the complaint sought unspecified compensatory damages  an order compelling the company to repair the engines and other relief 
on september   the company s motion to dismiss was granted by the court  the complaint was dismissed in its entirety  and no appeal was taken

the objectives and procedures for facility lead corrective action under rcra are consistent with the investigation and remediation already being conducted under the agreement with the navy  and the company agreed to participate in epa s corrective action program under a rcra facility lead agreement 
although the ri fs is still underway and substantial uncertainty exists concerning the nature and scope of the environmental investigation and remediation that will ultimately be required at the york facility  the company estimates that its share of the future response costs at the york facility will be approximately million 
the company has established reserves for this amount  which are included in accrued expenses and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 
the estimate of the company s future response costs that will be incurred at the york facility is based on reports of independent environmental consultants retained by the company  the actual costs incurred to date  and the estimated costs to complete the necessary investigation and remediation activities 
response costs are expected to be incurred over a period of several years ending in liquidity and capital resources as of december  operating activities the company s main source of liquidity is cash from operating activities which consists of net income adjusted for non cash operating activities  collections of retained securitization interests  pension plan contributions  the tax benefit of stock option exercises and changes in current assets and liabilities

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates 
to reduce such risks  the company selectively uses derivative financial instruments 
all hedging transactions are authorized and executed pursuant to regularly reviewed policies and procedures  which prohibit the use of financial instruments for trading purposes

the company sells its products internationally and in most markets those sales are made in the foreign country s local currency 
as a result  the company s earnings can be affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currency

the foreign currency contracts are entered into with banks and allow the company to exchange a specified amount of foreign currency for us dollars at a future date  based on a fixed exchange rate 
at december  these contracts represented a combined us dollar equivalent of approximately million 
the company estimates that a uniform weakening in the value of the dollar relative to the currency underlying these contracts would result in a decrease in the fair value of the contracts of approximately million 
the company s exposure to the japanese yen is substantially offset by the existence of a natural hedge  which is sustained through offsetting yen cash inflows from sales with yen cash outflows for motorcycle component purchases and other operating expenses 
hdfs earnings are affected by changes in interest rates
