item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ substantially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of several factors  including the cautionary statements included in exhibit to this annual report on form k 
overview in november  the company acquired sterling holding company sterling  a privately held company based in mesa  arizona that designs and manufactures radio frequency rf and microwave interconnect products via its two operating units  trompeter electronics  inc and semflex  inc 
the company completed this merger on november   following approval by both company and sterling shareholders 
at closing  sterling became a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  with sterling shareholders receiving  shares of the company s common stock  which represented approximately of the company s total shares outstanding immediately prior to the consummation of the merger 
of such amount   shares were placed in escrow to provide indemnification to the company with respect to certain matters provided for in the merger agreement 
company common shares issued in this transaction were valued at a share  the closing price on july   the day the merger was announced 
the company also issued  shares of series b redeemable preferred stock with a face value of million and a contingent value of up to an additional million based on certain events  including the future performance of the company s share price 
the total purchase consideration was million  consisting of common and preferred shares of company stock valued at million and million of acquisition related costs 
our 
table of contents financial statements  including our results of operations  commencing on november   reflect the acquisition of sterling 
in connection with the transaction  the company expanded its board of directors to nine members 
the new board is comprised of four members of the company s board at the time of the closing of the merger  four members from sterling s board  and an additional director chosen by sterling 
on may   we announced that our board of directors had decided to explore various strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value  including a possible sale of the company 
in that connection  our board of directors has formed a committee and has retained cibc world markets corp 
as its exclusive financial advisor 
there can be no assurance that a transaction will result involving the company 
we develop  manufacture and sell optical  rf  and microwave components and subsystems for various applications and multiple end markets 
these subsystems are designed for use in storage  data networking  metro and wide area telecom networks  military  aerospace  video  government security  oil and gas  and other industrial markets and applications 
we plan to continue to diversify our end markets and expand our product offerings through internal and  possibly  external growth 
our products are compatible with the various standards used in these applications  including gigabit ethernet  fast ethernet  fibre channel  and synchronous optical network sonet  and other standards dictated by the application of our products 
our net sales are derived from the sale of optical components and subsystems to original equipment manufacturers oems and local resellers  and from the sale of rf and microwave components to telecom service providers  oems  military and government users  and distributors and resellers 
our net sales have fluctuated from period to period due to customer demand for our products  the size and timing of customer orders  our ability to deliver in the relevant period and any canceled  delayed or rescheduled orders in the relevant period 
we determine inventory reserves in light of the rapid technological change experienced in our industry on a product by product basis 
while it is likely that obsolescence due to rapid technological change will continue  the timing and amount of this obsolescence cannot be predicted with certainty 
the average unit prices of many of our products generally decrease as the products mature in response to factors such as increased competition  the introduction of new products and increased unit volumes 
we anticipate that average selling prices of many of our products will continue to decline in future periods  although the timing and degree of the declines cannot be predicted with any certainty 
we must continue to develop and introduce new products that incorporate features that can be sold at higher average selling prices  on a timely basis 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to introduce new products to offset the anticipated decrease in the average selling prices of our products 
license fees and royalties represent payments received from licensees of our patented technology  which is also used by us in our optical subsystems 
these license agreements generally provide for up front payments and or future fixed payments or ongoing royalty payments based on a percentage of sales of the licensed products 
the timing and amounts of these payments is beyond our control 
accordingly  the amount received in any given period is expected to vary significantly 
the duration of these license agreements extend generally until the expiration of the licensed patents which range from to we will consider entering into similar agreements in the future  however  we are not able to predict whether we will enter into any additional licenses in the future and  if so  the amount of any license fees or royalties 
our cost of sales consists of materials  salaries and related expenses for manufacturing personnel and manufacturing overhead 
we purchase several key components used in the manufacture of our products from a limited number of suppliers 
we have periodically experienced shortages and delivery delays for these materials 
in some circumstances  we maintain an inventory of limited source components to decrease the risk of shortage 
if we overestimate our requirements  we may have excess inventory of these components 
the majority of our products are designed and manufactured in our own facilities 
in the future we may expand the volume of products manufactured by third parties 
in order to remain competitive  we must continually reduce our manufacturing costs through design and engineering innovations and increases in manufacturing efficiencies 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to reduce our manufacturing costs 

table of contents some of our critical components used in production of certain of our products are purchased from a key supplier which has been acquired by a competitor of the company 
if this supplier increases prices  reduces quantities available to us or ceases to supply us  our business and results of operations may be significantly harmed 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for design engineers  scientists and other technical personnel  depreciation of test and prototyping equipment  and tooling 
research and development expenses also consist of materials and operating expenses related to major product development projects 
we charge all research and development expenses to operations as incurred 
we believe that continued investment in research and development is critical to our long term business success 
we intend to continue to invest in research and development programs in future periods in order to enhance performance or reduce the cost of current optical  rf and microwave products  and develop new optical  rf  and microwave products 
there can be no assurance that these goals will be achieved or that our levels of spending and project selection will be sufficient and effective 
we market and sell our products domestically and internationally through our direct sales force  local resellers and manufacturers representatives 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs  including sales commissions  travel costs  outside consulting services  and product marketing and promotion costs 
we expect to continue to make significant expenditures for sales and marketing services 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for our administrative and financial groups  as well as legal  accounting  information technology and other professional fees 
we expect to continue to make significant expenditures for general and administrative services 
critical accounting policies accounts receivable we sell products primarily to various oems and distributors 
sales to these customers have varying degrees of collection risk associated with them 
management assesses collection risk and the related allowance for doubtful accounts based on the aging of accounts  historical experience and the customer s financial condition 
inventory reserves it is our policy to reserve of the value of inventory we specifically identify and consider obsolete or excessive to fulfilling future sales estimates 
we define obsolete inventory as inventory that will no longer be used in the manufacturing process or items that have potential quality problems 
excess inventory is defined as inventory in excess of one to two year s projected usage depending upon the product 
excess inventory is determined using our best estimate of future demand at the time  based upon information then available to us 
in general  our policy is to scrap inventory determined to be obsolete shortly after the determination is made and to keep excess inventory for a reasonable amount of time before it is discarded 
occasionally  changed circumstances in the marketplace present us with an opportunity to sell inventory that was previously determined to be excessive and reserved for 
if this occurs  we vigorously pursue such opportunities 
impairment of long lived assets we review the carrying value of our long lived assets if the facts and circumstances  such as significant declines in sales  earnings or cash flows or material adverse changes in the business climate suggest that they may be impaired 
if this review indicates that long lived assets will not be recoverable  as determined based on the estimated undiscounted cash flows of the long lived asset  impairment is measured by comparing the carrying value of the long lived asset to fair value 
fair value is determined based on quoted market values  discounted cash flows or appraisals 
if an asset is considered held for sale  we adjust the carrying value of the underlying assets to fair value  as determined based on the estimated net realizable proceeds of the assets 

table of contents revenue recognition revenue from product sales  net of trade discounts  is recognized when title passes  which generally occurs upon shipment 
we handle returns by replacing  repairing or issuing credit for defective products when returned 
we establish a reserve for returns based on any known and anticipated returns and accordingly adjust revenue  accounts receivable and inventories 
customer returns it is our policy to establish a reserve for customer returns based on any known returns and anticipated returns based on past experience and accordingly adjust revenue  accounts receivable and inventories 
customer demand is a changing dynamic 
occasionally  we have and will receive requests from customers to accept the return of merchandise for which they had previously accepted delivery 
although we have no obligation to do so  each such request is evaluated in light of contemplated future business from that customer 
we will continue to consider these requests in the future  however  we are not able to predict the amount of any such returns 
because we do support several fully franchised distribution agreements which include provisions for inventory rotation  certain products covered under these agreements are returned to us from time to time 
research and development all expenses relative to the development of a new product  prior to its introduction into production  are considered research and development expenses 
in addition  the costs of the engineering effort to do significant redesign to enhance product performance that results essentially in a new product are also considered to be research and development expenses 
because the true manufacturability of our products is not obvious until a period of volume production has occurred  initial production is considered a part of the development process 
during this phase  a portion of the scrap expense and yield loss is considered development expense 
a product continues to be considered under development until it matures to the point where its production yields volumes are consistent with other mature products and any related engineering effort is predominately dedicated to customer applications and or quality support

these increases were offset in part by a million decrease of net sales into the storage end market 
included in the amounts above is million in sales from product lines acquired in the merger with sterling 
excluding the sales attributable to the product lines acquired from sterling  sales decreased million in the year ended april  over fiscal the decrease in sales was primarily due to lower customer demand due to the current economic climate and reduced capital spending for optical networking equipment 
sales were also negatively impacted by declines in average unit prices for our products resulting from pricing pressure and changes in product mix 
our total sales order backlog increased to million as of april  from million as of april  this increase reflects a significant increase in the backlog in our military governmental end market and million from the merger with sterling 
these increases were offset partially by decreases reflecting lower customer demand for our products  customer push outs and cancellation of orders  due in part to delays in the launch of new product programs by our customers in other end markets we service 
license fees and royalties 
license fees and royalties decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease primarily relates to lump sum payments of approximately million from the receipt of license and royalty payments in association with the settlement of several

license fees consist of both fixed schedule payments and contingent payments based on sales volumes of licensed products 
cost of sales and gross margins 
cost of sales decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal gross profit as a percentage of net sales  or gross margin  increased to in fiscal from negative in fiscal approximately percentage points of the percentage point increase in gross margin was the result of the increase in sales and the reduction in prime costs and manufacturing costs  mainly charges related to impairment of long lived assets in fiscal approximately percentage points of the increase was due to the reduction in charges for obsolete and slow moving inventory and percentage points was attributable to the sale of approximately  of inventory that was previously considered excess and fully reserved 
these factors were offset by percentage points due to expenses related to restructuring charges 
cost of sales was charged approximately million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively  to increase the reserve for obsolete and excess inventory 
research and development 
research and development expenses decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the million decrease was primarily due to a reduction of million in charges related to impairment of long lived assets and a million reduction in a charge for the write off of costs of the acquisitions of tsunami optics  inc and paracer  inc 
that was allocated to intangible in process research and development 
the balance of the million decrease was the result of a million decrease in costs of research and development facilities  million decrease in personnel costs dedicated to research and development and million decrease in material and overhead cost related to major product development 
these decreases were offset by  in research and development expenses attributable to the product lines acquired from sterling 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase was due to an increase of million in sales and marketing salaries  fringe benefits  bonuses and commissions  and  in field sales operating costs supporting our sales volume 
the above amounts include million of sales and marketing expenses attributable to the product lines acquired from sterling 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this million decrease was due primarily to a reduction of a million charge for goodwill impairment in fiscal  a reduction of million in charges related to impairment of long lived assets other than goodwill  a million decrease in corporate management costs and a million gain on the sale of bandwidth semiconductor llc 
these decreases were offset in part by million for the settlement of litigation   of lease obligations for limited use facilities  a million increase in general expenses and million of general and administrative expenses attributable to the product lines acquired from sterling 
we operate in markets that experienced a severe economic downturn that began late in the third quarter of fiscal and continued throughout fiscal and  as a result  many of our customers began to stretch their payment terms 
days sales in accounts receivable decreased to days at april  compared to days at april  investment income  net 
investment income  net of investment expense  decreased to  in fiscal from million in fiscal investment income consists of earnings on the short term investment of excess cash balances and the decrease of this income in fiscal reflects the reduction of excess cash balances as well as lower interest rates throughout the marketplace during this period 
income taxes 
the company has recorded a valuation allowance against deferred income tax assets primarily associated with tax loss carry forwards based on the significant operating losses experienced 
as a result  valuation allowances of million were recorded at april   which eliminated the tax benefit attributable to the losses incurred in fiscal years and we have continued to experience operating 
table of contents losses during fiscal year  and an additional valuation allowance of million was recorded  which eliminated the tax benefit attributable to the net loss incurred in fiscal we have net operating loss carry forwards of approximately million that are available to offset taxable income in the future 
the net operating loss carry forwards will expire in through cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
effective may   the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and performed a transitional goodwill impairment test as of that date 
as a result  it was determined that the goodwill of our active optical subsystems reporting unit had been impaired and recorded a one time noncash charge of approximately million 
this charge was recorded as of may  and is reflected as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the statement of operations

the increase was partially offset by lower royalties as a result of generally lower sales of optical subsystems among licensees consistent with general economic conditions in the optical networking market 
license fees consist of both fixed schedule payments and contingent payments based on sales volumes of licensed products 
cost of sales and gross margins 
cost of sales decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal gross profit as a percentage of net sales  or gross margin  decreased to negative in fiscal from negative in fiscal approximately percentage points of the percentage point decrease in gross margin was due to charges related to impairment of long lived assets  percentage points was a result of the decline in sales and the decline in the average unit selling price for our products due primarily to pricing pressures and product mix  percentage points was due to the write down to fair market value of assets held for sale  percentage points was due to charges for obsolete and slow moving inventory and percentage points was due to the expenses related to restructuring charges

we operate in markets that are currently experiencing a severe economic downturn that began late in the third quarter of fiscal and escalated during the first quarter of fiscal as a result  many of our customers began to stretch their payment terms 
days sales in accounts receivable increased to days at april  compared to days at april  during the first quarter of fiscal  we identified customers that we considered to be high risk relative to the collection of accounts receivable 
based upon this review  we recorded an additional million provision for doubtful accounts in the first quarter of fiscal investment income  net 
investment income  net of investment expense  decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal investment income consists of earnings on the short term investment of excess cash balances and the decrease of this income in fiscal reflects the reduction of excess cash balances as well as lower interest rates throughout the market place during this period

liquidity and capital resources net cash used in operating activities totaled million  million and million for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the use of cash in operating activities for fiscal resulted primarily from the net loss and increase in inventories offset in part by the decrease in accounts receivable  other assets and the increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
the use of cash in operating activities in fiscal and resulted primarily from the net loss and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses offset in part by decreases in accounts receivable and inventories 

table of contents net cash provided by investing activities was million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
these amounts reflect the net proceeds from the sale of short term investments  the proceeds from the sale of assets held for sale  and in fiscal  million cash acquired in the merger with sterling net of acquisition expenses  offset in part by the purchases of equipment and facilities in both fiscal years and the net purchase of short term investments in fiscal net cash used in investing activities in fiscal was million related primarily to acquisitions  purchases of equipment and facilities and the purchase of short term investments 
we expended million for the acquisition of substantially all of the net assets of the optical flexcircuits division of advanced interconnection technology  inc in may and million net of cash received for the acquisition of tsunami optics  inc in february in addition  the company acquired million in cash from the acquisition of all the outstanding common stock of paracer  inc in march net cash used in financing activities for fiscal represents repayments on long term borrowings  a million distribution to the former owners of sterling to satisfy a liability assumed in the acquisition   in treasury stock transactions and  of dividends on preferred stock  offset in part by  of proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
net cash used in financing activities for fiscal and fiscal represents repayments on long term borrowings 
as of april   our principal source of liquidity was approximately million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
our future capital requirements will depend on a number of factors  including our ability to generate increased sales and our ability to manage operating expenses 
the continued diversification of our end markets and expansion of our product offerings through internal and  possibly  external growth could materially change our level of cash and cash equivalents 
this diversification may require the company to seek equity or debt financing 
our only cash commitments are i the repayment of long term debt of approximately million and ii the payment of cumulative cash dividends on the series b preferred stock on terms specified in the certificate of designation for such stock 
we also are obligated to redeem all shares of series b preferred stock in accordance with the terms of the certificate of designation for such stock no later than days following the occurrence of certain events relating to the company s achievement of million in annual revenue or million in market capitalization 
in addition  if a change of control of the company occurs  the series b preferred stock becomes redeemable for an aggregate of million  subject to upward adjustment under certain circumstances relating to market price of the company s common stock 
we believe that our current cash balances will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for working capital  capital expenditures  the series b preferred stock dividend and repayments of long term debt for the next months 
the settlement of  or an adverse result in  current and future litigation may  however  significantly affect our cash position and capital requirements 
to the extent that the company needs to or deems it advisable to seek equity or debt financing in connection with any of the foregoing  no assurance can be given that such financing will be available  or that it will be available on favorable terms 
we operate in markets that have experienced a severe economic downturn that began late in the third quarter of fiscal these conditions continued in fiscal  during which we experienced significant decreases in net sales and incurred net losses  offset to a certain extent by the acquisition of sterling 
we expect the difficult industry conditions to continue for at least the next to months and they may continue for a longer period 
any continued or further decline in demand for our customers products or in general economic conditions would likely result in further reduction in demand for our products and our business  operating results and financial condition would suffer 
further  in order to propel overall industry growth and to encourage interoperability of supplier components  subsystems  systems and networks  various industry standards have evolved and are evolving which provide customers the opportunity to choose between vendors who have form  fit and function compatible products that are essentially interchangeable as second or third sources 
as customers manage their supply chains more efficiently  pricing pressure increases on vendors  such as stratos  reducing gross margins for similar products 

table of contents in response to these conditions  we have implemented personnel reductions  shut down certain facilities  disposed of certain assets and put in place other cost reduction programs  however  since many of our costs are fixed in the near term  we expect to continue to incur significant manufacturing  research and development  sales and marketing and administrative expenses 
consequently  we will need to generate higher revenues while containing costs and operating expenses if we are to return to profitability 
if our efforts to increase our revenues and contain our costs are not successful  we will continue to incur net losses 
we are also examining and pursuing opportunities for improving gross margins and cash flow 
the merger with sterling combined two companies with brands that are well respected by segments of the telecommunications  military  video and broadcast customer base that seek solutions to difficult problems at the electrical side of the high performance  high bandwidth interface which are solved by products offered by stratos 
we believe that these products  when combined with superior customer service  provide the potential for improving gross margins and cash flows 
accordingly  we are examining the requirements of our customers and the broader potential customer base where our core competencies could provide value to customers in an enduring and profitable way 
we are also focused on improving customer service through better execution of delivery  support and cycle time  particularly for specialty products to those customers who value and will pay for this service 
we seek to create a customer responsive organization which executes on demand and stands behind its customers strategy 
there is no assurance that these efforts will be successful 
the company s contractual obligations as of april  are as follows payment due by period in thousands less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations total item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is subject to certain market risks  including foreign currency and interest rates 
although certain of our subsidiaries enter into transactions in currencies other than their functional currency  foreign currency exposures arising from these transactions are not material to us 
the primary foreign currency exposure arises from the translation of our net equity investment in our foreign subsidiaries to us dollars 
we generally view as long term our investments in foreign subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the us dollar 
the primary currency to which we are exposed is the pound sterling 
the company does not have exposure to interest rate risk related to its debt obligations because the interest rates are fixed 
the company s market risk is the potential loss of income from the reduction in interest rates from the renewal of short term investments 
the company experienced such reductions in these rates during fiscal and fiscal
