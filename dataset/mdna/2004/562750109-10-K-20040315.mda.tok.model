we also provide services  including design  configuration  implementation and training services  plus customer support services and software enhancement subscriptions 
critical accounting policies and estimates the consolidated financial statements include accounts of both us and our subsidiaries 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related footnotes 
in preparing these financial statements  management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
we do not believe there is a great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported related to the accounting policies described below 
however  application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
revenues and revenue recognition our revenue is derived from i software and hosting fees  which consist of revenue from the licensing and hosting of software and revenue from funded research and development efforts  ii services revenue  which consist of fees from consulting  implementation and training services collectively  professional services  plus customer support services and software enhancement subscriptions  and iii hardware and other revenue  which consists of sales of hardware and reimbursed project expenses 
revenue recognition rules for software companies are very complex 
although we follow very specific and detailed guidelines in measuring revenue  the application of those guidelines requires judgment including i whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements  and if so  whether vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for those elements  ii whether customizations or modifications of the software are significant  and iii whether the software fee is collectible 
for arrangements that require the use of the percentage of completion method  the complexity of the estimation process and issues related to the assumptions  risks and 
table of contents uncertainties inherent with the application of the percentage of completion method of accounting affect the amounts of revenue and related expenses reported in our consolidated financial statements 
a number of internal and external factors can affect our estimates  including labor rates  utilization and efficiency variances and specification and testing requirement changes 
we recognize software fees in accordance with statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition sop  as amended by statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions sop 
under sop  we recognize software license revenue when the following criteria are met a signed contract is obtained  delivery of the product has occurred  the license fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is probable 
sop requires recognition of revenue using the residual method when there is vendor specific objective evidence of the fair values of all undelivered elements in a multiple element arrangement that is not accounted for using long term contract accounting  vendor specific objective evidence of fair value does not exist for one or more of the delivered elements in the arrangement  and all revenue recognition criteria in sop other than the requirement for vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of each delivered element of the arrangement are satisfied 
for those contracts that contain significant customization or modifications  license revenue is recognized under the percentage of completion method 
we estimate the percentage of completion utilizing hours incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated hours to complete the project 
we provide for project losses in their entirety in the period in which they become known 
hosting fees  which consist of fees for the license of our software and maintenance of the software and related hardware  are generally paid in advance and recognized ratably over the term of the hosting arrangement 
we occasionally enter into funded research and development agreements for the enhancement of existing products or for the development of new products 
revenues from these funded development efforts are recognized under the percentage of completion method and included in the software and hosting fees line item in our statement of income 
the costs associated with the funded development efforts are included in the research and development line item in our statement of income 
most of our software arrangements include professional services 
professional services revenues are generally accounted for separately from the software license revenues because the arrangements qualify as service transactions as defined by sop the most significant factors considered in determining whether the revenue should be accounted for separately include the nature of the services ie  consideration of whether the services are essential to the functionality of the licensed product  degree of risk  availability of services from other vendors and timing of payments 
fees from professional services performed by us are generally billed on an hourly basis  and revenue is recognized as the services are performed 
from time to time  we will enter into professional services agreements in which billings are limited to contractual maximums or based upon a fixed fee for portions of or all of the engagement 
revenue related to fixed fee based contracts is recognized on a percent complete basis based on the hours incurred 
project losses are provided for in their entirety in the period in which they become known 
fees from customer support services and software enhancement subscriptions are generally paid in advance and recognized as revenue ratably over the term of the agreement  typically months 
hardware revenue is generated from the resale of a variety of hardware products  developed and manufactured by third parties  which are integrated with and complementary to our software solutions 
these products include computer equipment  radio frequency terminal networks  rfid chip readers  bar code printers and scanners and other peripherals 
we generally purchase hardware from our vendors only after receiving an order from a customer  and revenue is recognized upon shipment by the vendor to the customer 
accounts receivable we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain an allowance for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
additions to the allowance for doubtful accounts generally represent a sales allowance on services revenue  which are recorded to operations as a reduction to services revenue 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
our top five customers in aggregate accounted for  and of total revenue for each of the years ended december    and  respectively 
sales to one customer the significant customer accounted for approximately of total revenue for the year ended december  most of the revenue from the significant customer in arose from purchases of hardware 
no single customer accounted for more than of revenue in or 
table of contents on january   the significant customer for filed for bankruptcy under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code 
as a result of the filing  the uncertainties around the bankruptcy proceedings and the ultimate timing of payment  we recorded an allowance of million in to effectively defer revenues arising in the fourth quarter of from the significant customer  but unpaid at the time of the bankruptcy declaration 
we recorded a recovery of approximately million of the receivable in the fourth quarter of upon receiving the final cash settlement in june  subsequent to the significant customer emerging from bankruptcy  we recovered an additional  of the receivable during the second quarter of the recoveries were recorded as separate revenue line items in the consolidated statements of income and reductions to the allowance for doubtful accounts in the consolidated balance sheets during the respective quarters 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill our business acquisitions have resulted in  and future acquisitions typically will result in  the recording of goodwill  which represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired  as well as capitalized technology and other definite lived intangible assets 
in  statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
became effective and as a result  we ceased amortizing goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives 
in lieu of amortization  we perform annual impairment reviews 
we completed the initial impairment review of our goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives on june  as required by sfas no 
and no impairment losses were recognized 
additionally  we performed annual reviews of our goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment as of december  and  and did not identify any asset impairment as a result of the reviews 
we will continue to test for impairment on an annual basis as of december  or on an interim basis if circumstances change that would indicate the possibility of an impairment 
the impairment review requires an analysis of future projections and assumptions about our operating performance 
should such review indicate the assets are impaired  we would record an expense for the impaired assets 
in august  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
this new statement also supercedes certain aspects of apb  reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual  and infrequently occurring events and transactions  with regard to reporting the effects of a disposal of a segment of a business 
sfas no 
requires that we evaluate long lived assets based on the net future cash flow expected to be generated from the asset on an undiscounted basis whenever significant events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in addition  sfas no 
requires expected future operating losses from discontinued operations to be reported as discontinued operations in the period incurred rather than as of the measurement date as presently required by apb 
in addition  more dispositions may qualify for discontinued operations treatment 
income taxes we provide for the effect of income taxes on our financial position and results of operations in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under this accounting pronouncement  income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and for deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity s financial statements or tax returns 
management must make significant assumptions  judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes and also our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against our net deferred tax asset 
our judgments  assumptions and estimates relative to the current provision for income tax take into account current tax laws  our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities 
changes in tax law or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of current and future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our financial position and results of operations 
our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to the value of our net deferred tax asset take into account predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income 
actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could render our current assumptions  judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes inaccurate  thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations 

table of contents acquisitions on december   we acquired certain assets of logistics

table of contents results of operations overview in fiscal  our primary goal was to expand our position as a leading provider of supply chain execution solutions by delivering integrated warehouse  transportation  trading partner and performance management solutions to our customers to drive revenue and earnings growth 
with the addition and integration of new products resulting from three acquisitions completed during and  as discussed above  along with the synchronized release of new versions of our product suite with enhanced functionality  we were able to accomplish continued revenue growth 
during  we continued to experience effects from a weak spending environment for information technology in the united states and europe  in the form of delayed and cancelled buying decisions by customers for our software  services and hardware  deferrals by customers of service engagements previously scheduled and pressure by our customers and competitors to discount our offerings 
we believe that prolonged continuation of or further deterioration in the current business climates  and the continued delay in capital spending within the united states and or other geographic regions in which we operate  principally the united kingdom and continental europe  could have a material adverse impact on our future operations 
there remains much uncertainty as to the future macro economic and business environmental conditions  making forecasting difficult 
we continue to focus on delivering innovative products and solutions for our customers to drive revenue and earnings growth 
in fiscal  we plan to continue to enhance our software solutions and to continue our global expansion and to further develop our strategic alliances and indirect sales channels 
our success could be limited by several factors  including spending on information technology  the timely release of quality new products and releases  continued market acceptance of our products and the introduction of new products by existing or new competitors 
revenue year ended year ended year ended december  change december  change december  to to software and hosting fees percentage of total revenues services percentage of total revenues hardware and other percentage of total revenues recovery allowance for bankrupt customer total revenue percentage is not meaningful our revenue consists of fees generated from the licensing and hosting of software  fees from professional services  customer support services and software enhancement subscriptions  and sales of complementary radio frequency and computer equipment  which are considered non strategic 
we believe our revenue growth in the last two years is attributable to several factors  including  among others  increased sales of our expanded product suite  geographic expansion  our market leadership positions as to breadth of product offerings and financial stability and a compelling return on investment proposition for our customers 
software and hosting fees 
the increase in software and hosting fees during was due to sales of newer products  hosting fees and funded development  which did not exist in or the increase in was primarily attributable to sales of new products  including our lower cost warehouse management windows product

the increases in services revenue from to and to were principally due to i increases in engagements required to implement the increased amount of software sold and to upgrade existing customers to more current versions of our offerings  and ii renewals of customer support services and software enhancement subscription agreements on a growing installed base 
during the economic downturn  we have experienced some pricing pressures with regard to our services 
we believe that the pricing pressures are attributable to global macro economic conditions and competitive pressures 
hardware and other 
sales of hardware are non strategic and largely dependent upon customer specific desires 
sales of hardware decreased million  or  from approximately million in to approximately million in sales of hardware decreased million  or  from approximately million in to approximately million in the decreases in hardware sales from to and to are attributable to customers desires in the current macro economic environment to buy hardware from other suppliers offering greater discounts  combined with increased sales of our optimization and transportation products  which require less hardware than our core warehouse management products 
as described in the notes to consolidated financial statements  reimbursements for out of pocket expenses are required to be classified as revenue and are included in hardware and other revenue 
for  and  reimbursements by customers for out of pocket expenses were approximately million  million and million  respectively

we have defined technological feasibility as the point in time at which we have a detailed program design or a working model of the related product  depending upon the type of development effort 
for the years ended december  and  we capitalized no research and development costs because the costs between the attainment of technological feasibility for the related software product through the date of general release were insignificant

we have recorded goodwill and other acquisition related intangible assets as part of the purchase accounting associated with various acquisitions  including the acquisitions of logistics 
com in december  returncentral in june and streamsoft in october the increase in the amortization of acquisition related intangibles that have finite lives and are separable from goodwill in was attributable to amortization expense associated with the acquisitions of logistics 
com  returncentral and streamsoft 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 which requires that goodwill and certain intangible assets no longer be amortized to earnings  but instead be tested for impairment at least annually 
the decrease in amortization expense from to was the direct result of the adoption of sfas in process research and development and acquisition related charges
