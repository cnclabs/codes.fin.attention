item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview halifax is a nationwide high availability multi vendor enterprise maintenance service provider for enterprises  including businesses  global service providers  governmental agencies  and other organizations 
halifax has undertaken significant changes to its business in recent years 
after selling the operational outsourcing division in  we began the shift of our business to a predominantly services model 
in august  we completed the acquisition of microserv  inc  which significantly expanded our geographic base  strengthened our nationwide service delivery capabilities  bolstered management depth  and added several prestigious customers 
we offer a growing list of services to businesses  and governmental agencies 
our services are customized to meet the customer s needs ranging from xx service  providing personnel with required security clearances for certain governmental programs  project management services  depot repair and roll out services 
we believe the flexibility offered to our customers enables us to tailor a solution to obtain maximum efficiencies within their budgeting constraints 
in july  we completed a private placement in the amount of million  which strengthened our financial position 
in august  we completed the acquisition of microserv  inc  which significantly expanded our geographic base  strengthened our nationwide service delivery capabilities  bolstered management depth  and added several prestigious customers 
at march   we recorded a deferred tax asset of million 
based upon our historical taxable income over the past three years and estimates of future profitability  management concluded that future income will more than likely be sufficient to realize our deferred tax assets 
the recording of this tax benefit had a significant positive effect on the results of operations and balance sheet 
the industry in which we operate has experienced unfavorable economic conditions and competitive challenges 
our operating results reflect the impact of this challenging environment 
we continue to see significant price competition and customer demand for higher service attainment levels 
in addition  we continue to see significant pressure in the market for state and local government contracts as a result of budget issues  political pressure and other factors beyond our control 
as experienced with the recent loss of our contract with the commonwealth of pennsylvania  longevity and quality of service may have little influence in the decision making process 
services revenues included monthly recurring fixed unit price contracts as well as time and material contracts 
amounts billed in advance of the services period are recorded as unearned revenues and recognized when earned 
the revenues and related expenses associated with product sales are recognized when the products are delivered and accepted by the customer 
revenues related to the fixed price service agreements are recognized ratably over the lives of the agreements 
invoices billed in advance are recognized as revenues when earned 
amounts billed in advance of the services period are recorded as unearned revenues and recognized when earned 
losses on contracts  if any  are recognized in the period in which the losses become determinable 
our future operating results may be affected by a number of factors including uncertainties relative to national economic conditions and terrorism  especially as they affect interest rates  industry factors and our ability to successfully increase our sales of services and effectively manage expenses 
we plan to effectively manage expenses in relation to revenues by directing new business development towards markets that complement or improve our existing service lines 
management must also continue to emphasize operating efficiencies through cost containment strategies  reengineering efforts and improved service delivery techniques 
due to the intense competition in our industry we must continue to expand our service offerings and persist in cost reduction efforts 
we also have to leverage technology to gain efficiencies in our back office 
we have also concentrated on  and will continue to concentrate on cost reduction  particularly within costs of services  selling  marketing and general and administrative expenses 
for fiscal  our priorities include expanding our customer base of private sector clients through our existing global service provider partners  seeking new global service provider partners  winning additional contracts for secure network services in government and intelligence matters  and enhancing the technology we use to deliver cost effective services to our growing customer base 
consolidated results of operations the following discussion and analysis provides information that management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our consolidated results of operations for the fiscal years ended march   and and financial condition as of march  and we operate as a single business segment  whereby we provide high availability maintenance services  technology deployment and integration  and secure network solutions for commercial and government clients 
years ended march  amounts in thousands  except share data results of operations change change revenues cost of services percent of revenues gross margin percent of revenues selling percent of revenues marketing percent of revenues general and administrative percent of revenues total selling  marketing and general administrative   n m   percent of revenues operating income percent of revenues interest expense other income n m n m income before taxes income tax benefit expense   n m n m net income earnings per share basic earnings per share diluted n m not meaningful revenues revenues are generated from the sale of high availability enterprise maintenance services  technology deployment and secure network services consisting of professional services  seat management and deployment services  and product sales and secure network services 
services revenues include monthly recurring fixed unit price contracts as well as time and material contracts 
amounts billed in advance of the services period are recorded as unearned revenues and recognized when earned 
the revenues and related expenses associated with product sales are recognized when the products are delivered and accepted by the customer 
march  amounts in thousands revenues services product held for resale total revenues for fiscal year revenues decreased  or thousand  compared to fiscal year during fiscal year  we experienced an increase in our high availability maintenance services and technology deployment activities  however this was offset by a decrease in our secure network offering 
the decline in secure network services was a result of non recurring services in that did not materialize in product held for resale also increased by thousand during fiscal year to million compared to million in the microserv acquisition completed in august added several marquee accounts to our enterprise maintenance services 
however  these gains were negatively affected by pricing concessions and certain lost contracts 
for fiscal year revenues increased  or million  to million compared to the change in revenues was largely the result of a change in the sales mix of our business from a value added reseller to a services company 
during fiscal year services revenues increased million  or  compared with fiscal a significant portion of this increase in services revenues for was attributable to a million non recurring contract 
this was offset by decline in sales of product held for resale which was million in fiscal compared to million in  a decrease 
the decrease in product sales was principally the result of management s intentional de emphasis of this low margin line of business 
in fiscal year  we expect our services revenues to increase while our product sales revenues will decline due to on going price competition 
we expect the product trends to continue downward with many of the new products being offered at lower prices and with significantly lower margins 
the components of revenues for fiscal year  and were cost of services included within cost of services are direct costs  including fringe benefits  product and part costs  and other costs 
a large part of our service costs are support costs and expenses that include direct labor and infrastructure costs to support our service offerings 
as we continue to expand our source offerings  we anticipate that the direct costs to support these service offerings will continue to increase in fiscal year on long term fixed unit price contracts part costs vary depending upon the call volume received from customers during the period 
many of these costs are volume driven and as volumes increase  these costs as a percentage of revenues increase  generating a negative impact to profit margins 
the variable component of these costs is product and part cost 
product is broken into two categories parts and equipment to support our service base and product held for resale 
part cost is highly variable and is dependent on several factors 
on long term fixed unit price contracts  parts and peripherals are consumed on service calls 
for installation services and seat management services  product may consist of hardware  software  cabling and other materials that are components of the service performed 
product held for resale consists of hardware and software 
cost of services consists of the following components march  amounts in thousands services delivery and support product held for resale total direct costs indirect costs cost of services during fiscal year our cost of services delivery and support decreased by million from million during to million 
the decrease in the cost of services delivery and support was primarily related to reduced costs associated with the non recurring revenues in our secured network services in additional cost reductions were achieved through the integration of microserv and continued cost containment efforts 
during fiscal year  the services delivery and support component of cost of services increased million  or  during fiscal year compared to the increase in service costs was attributable to the expansion of our services to seven days a week  hours a day and costs incurred for a one time non recurring contract 
during fiscal year  we continued to see erosion in gross margins on product held for resale due to the competitively priced product market 
the cost of product held for resale increased thousand to million due to increased revenue compared to fiscal year and the resulting gross margin on product held for resale was thousand  or in fiscal year compared to the cost of product held for resale of million and the resulting gross margin on product held for resale of in fiscal year in fiscal year  there was a decrease in the cost of product held for resale of compared to  primarily as a result of decreased product sales 
total direct cost during fiscal year when compared to fiscal year decreased million  or  from to as result of the decrease in services delivery and support offset by the increases in costs related to product held for resale 
total direct cost for fiscal year ended increased million from fiscal year due to increases in service delivery and support costs as we expanded our service delivery capabilities offset by reduced costs of product held for resale due to reduced hardware revenues 
indirect costs increased thousand from million in fiscal year to million for  a increase 
the increase in indirect costs was attributable to several factors the integration of microserv with associated payroll and occupancy costs  and increases in travel  telecommunications and business insurance 
in addition  we experienced a significant increase in recruiting fees as we increased personnel with required security clearances by in our secured networks group 
during the fiscal year  indirect cost decreased  or thousand  compared to march  the decrease was largely due to overall cost containment  including reducing occupancy cost  consolidation of administrative functions  reduced staffing and higher utilization of our workforce 
gross margin our fiscal year gross margin reflected the economic and competitive challenges we faced 
as a percent of revenues  the gross margin percent was for fiscal years  and  respectively 
however  gross margins decreased thousand  or  from fiscal year as compared to  primarily as a result of reduced revenues discussed above 
as a result of the favorable changes in the mix of our business and continued emphasis on higher margin long term services contracts  we experienced improvement in our gross margin of thousand  or  in fiscal year from million in fiscal year we must continue to grow  persist in our cost reduction efforts and deploy technology to gain operating efficiencies in order to remain competitive 
selling expenses selling expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions  travel costs and related expenses for personnel engaged in sales 
for fiscal  selling expense increased thousand to million from million in the prior year  which was an increase of 
during fiscal year  selling expense increased or thousand when compared to the primary reasons for the increase in and in selling expense were commissions related to new business and increased travel 
marketing expense we created the marketing group in fiscal year to facilitate a nationwide sales campaign 
in doing so  we refined and redirected our sales force and strategy  focusing our direct sales efforts on specific targeted accounts and growing our base of strategic partners to strengthen our indirect sales channel  which has resulted in growth in higher margin service revenues 
marketing expense decreased from thousand in fiscal year to thousand in  an decrease  as a result of various cost containment actions and curtailment of marketing programs 
in fiscal year  marketing expense increased thousand  or  from thousand in to thousand in this increase in was attributable to increased promotional efforts and traveling during general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist of primarily salaries and related expenses for corporate executives  finance  human resources  and investor relations  as well as professional fees  corporate legal expenses  other corporate expenses  information technology  and facilities expense 
general and administrative expense decreased thousand  or  in fiscal year compared to this decrease was a result of cost control efforts  including employment actions such as postponing salary increases  and in certain cases  reducing wage rates for administrative staff 
during fiscal year  general and administrative expense decreased thousand  or  compared to the decrease in general and administrative expense from fiscal year was attributable to decreased professional fees  consulting services  and decreases in business insurance due to general market conditions 
in spite of vigorous cost containment efforts  various factors  such as changes in insurance markets  related costs associated with new securities and exchange commission rules and the american stock exchange regulations compliance mandates may increase general and administrative expenses and may have a negative impact on fiscal year the individual components of selling  marketing and general and administrative costs have changed from year to year but in total have remained relatively flat for fiscal years  and  respectively 
operating income operating income was million for fiscal year compared to million last year  a decrease of or thousand 
the factors discussed above  the economy and competitive challenges are the primary reasons for the decrease in operating income for fiscal year operating income improved from thousand in fiscal year to million in fiscal year the improvement in fiscal year was a result of the change in the revenues mix to higher margin revenues  and the positive effect of cost containment initiatives 
interest expense interest expense decreased from thousand to thousand during fiscal year due to slightly lower monthly borrowing activities compared to fiscal year and lower interest rates 
during fiscal year compared to  interest expense increased from thousand  or  in fiscal year to thousand in fiscal year  due to increased borrowings 
income taxes during the year ended march   we recorded a non recurring income tax benefit of million 
we believe that it is appropriate to record the deferred tax asset based upon our estimates of future profitability  as well as past performance 
the tax benefit consists of the realization of the tax benefits for timing differences for financial reporting and income tax purposes 
the components of the tax benefit are primarily the net operating loss carryforward  allowances for doubtful accounts  inventory obsolesence reserves and depreciation and amortization expense 
note to the consolidated financial statements contains an analysis of our deferred tax assets and the full reversal of our deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
during years ended march  and  respectively  we recorded provisions from income taxes of thousand 
the company had previously provided a valuation allowance of approximately million and million for those years 
net income as a result of income from operations of thousand and the non recurring income tax benefit of million  net income increased from thousand in fiscal year to million in fiscal year earnings per share were  basic  and  diluted for the year ended march  compared to  basic and diluted  for the fiscal year net earnings for fiscal year ended march  was thousand or 
per share  basic and diluted 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization was thousand  thousand and thousand for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
during fiscal year  depreciation and amortization increased thousand of which thousand was the amortization of intangible assets as a result of the microserv acquisition and thousand of increased depreciation as a result of upgrading our information systems and technology 
in we will continue our investment in technology which will increase our operating efficiency 
for the year ended march   the decrease in depreciation and amortization was due to the implementation of statement of financial accounting standard no 
goodwill and other intangible assets which required that goodwill no longer be amortized against earnings  but instead be reviewed periodically for impairment 
in addition  there were reductions in depreciation expense due to an increase in fully depreciated assets and a decrease in capital expenditures for fiscal years ended march  and  respectively 
we continue to focus the majority of our capital spending on technology enhancements that will increase operating efficiencies 
liquidity and capital resources our future operating results may be affected by a number of factors including uncertainties relative to national economic conditions and terrorism  especially as they affect interest rates  industry factors and our ability to successfully increase our sales of services and effectively manage expenses 
we must continue to effectively manage expenses in relation to revenues by directing new business development towards markets that complement or improve our existing service lines 
management also plan continue to emphasize operating efficiencies through cost containment strategies  reengineering efforts and improved service delivery techniques 
halifax serves its customer base by providing high availability enterprise maintenance services  consulting  integration  networking  and installation services 
this industry has been characterized by rapid technological advances that have resulted in frequent introductions of new products  product enhancements and aggressive pricing practices  which also impact pricing of service activities 
our operating results could be adversely affected by industry wide pricing pressures  the loss of a major customer  the ability to recruit  train and retain personnel integral to our operations and the presence of competitors with greater financial and other resources 
also  our operating results could be adversely impacted should our company be unable to achieve the revenues growth necessary to provide profitable operating margins in various operations 
operating results may also be negatively affected due to costs associated with starting a major contract 
many costs associated with starting a new contract  such as hiring additional personnel  training  travel and logistics are expensed as incurred and may also significantly impact cash flow during the startup period 
although we believe our relationship with our bank is satisfactory  there are no assurances that additional funds  if needed  to help fund start up costs related to a major new contract will be forthcoming 
our plan for growth includes intensified marketing efforts  an expanding national sales program  strategic alliances and acquisitions that expand market share 
there can be no assurances these efforts will be successful  or if successful  will be on terms advantageous to us 
liquidity and capital resources amounts in thousands cash balance at march working capital at march net cash provided by used in operating activities net cash used in investment activities net cash used in provided by financing activities at march   we had working capital of million and a current ratio of 
the increase in working capital was attributable to net earnings and the reduction of the valuation allowance on our deferred tax asset 
a summary of future minimum lease payments is set forth below and in note to the consolidated financial statements 
capital expenditures in fiscal year were thousand and in fiscal year were thousand 
we anticipate fiscal year technology requirements to result in capital expenditures totaling approximately thousand 
our company continues to sublease a portion of its headquarters building which reduces its rent expense by approximately thousand annually 
on march   we entered into a new revolving credit agreement with an million maximum amount of available credit 
on august  the loan maximum on the revolving credit agreement was increased to million 
the form of the loan was extended and now has a maturity date of july  all other terms and conditions remain the same 
the loan bears interest at the bank s prime rate plus 
advances under the revolving credit agreement are collateralized by a first priority security interest in all of our assets as defined in the revolving credit agreement 
the amount available to be borrowed under the revolving credit agreement is determined by applying stated percentages to the eligible receivables 
the revolving credit agreement contains a subjective acceleration clause whereby the lender may demand payment under certain circumstances as defined in the agreement 
we were in compliance with all of the covenants on our revolving credit agreement at march  the agreement contains covenants typical of arrangements of this type as well as a covenant that requires that the shareholders deficit not increase above million 
at march   our shareholders equity was million 
our recent results have shown increased profitability on contracts due to a combination of efficiencies gained in the change of mix in our business from the resale of product to more of services orientation  as well as reduced cost achieved through containment measures including reducing occupancy cost  consolidating of administrative functions  reducing staffing and higher utilization of our workforce 
although we expect to remain in compliance with the financial covenant related to shareholders deficit  no assurance can be given 
should shareholders deficit rise above million  we would attempt to work with the bank to arrive at a mutually acceptable resolution 
at june   million was outstanding under the revolving credit agreement 
if our customer base were to remain constant  we expect to have approximately million available on our revolving credit agreement through the next twelve months 
if we were to obtain a significant new contract or contract modifications  our borrowing availability may be less since we are generally required to invest significant initial startup funds which are subsequently billed to customers 
at march  and  million and million  respectively  was available to the company under the terms of the revolving credit agreement 
the revolving credit agreement prohibits the payment of dividends or distributions as well as limits the payment of principal or interest on subordinated debt  and is not paid until we obtain a waiver from the lender 
on august   we acquired of the stock in microserv  inc microserv for approximately million 
the consideration was cash of thousand  notes payable of thousand  and  shares of restricted common stock valued at  or million 
the notes mature on february  the shares were discounted approximately from the quoted market value of per share due to various trading restrictions 
our subordinated debt agreements with the estate of arch c 
scurlock or the estate  formerly research industries  incorporated  an affiliate  totaled million at march  and million at march  principal repayment and interest payable on the subordinated debt agreements have been extended to july  pursuant to the debt agreements  the estate holds thousand face amount of our convertible subordinated debt dated january  and thousand  thousand  thousand and thousand face amounts of our promissory notes 
during fiscal year  in conjunction with the private placement of million and following receipt of a waiver from the bank we made a principal repayment of million on the convertible subordinated debt and an additional thousand payment on the subordinated debt in september in addition  we made payments totaling thousand for interest accrued on the subordinate debt 
at march   interest payable to the estate was thousand 
during the fiscal year ended march   the bank approved  and we made payments of thousand for accrued interest 
our company believes that funds generated from operations  bank borrowings  and investing activities should be sufficient to meet its current operating cash requirements through the next twelve months  although there can be no assurances that all the aforementioned sources of cash can be realized 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including revenue growth  acquisition activity and expansion of our service offerings 
the following are our contractual obligations associated with lease commitments  debt obligations and consulting commitments 
amounts in thousands year ended bank line of other vehicle consulting operating march  credit debt loans commitment leases total thereafter total an affiliate see note to the consolidated financial statements  holds thousand face amount of our convertible subordinated debt dated january  and thousand  thousand  thousand  and thousand face amount of our subordinated notes dated october   october   november  and november   respectively 
these notes are each subordinate to our revolving credit agreement and cannot be paid without the consent of the bank 
the balance of our subordinated notes at march  was million 
in conjunction with the acquisition of microserv  we issued thousand notes to the former microserv shareholders 
the notes bear interest at and mature on february  we have three notes with an automobile manufacturer 
two notes have terms of months and one note has a term of months 
the balances and respective interest rates on the notes at march  were thousand  thousand  and thousand with interest rates of  and  respectively 
we have a consulting advisory service commitment with a former chief executive officer of the company 
from april  through march   we are to pay the former chief executive officer thousand per year for consulting services 
off balance sheet arrangements in conjunction with a government contract  we act as a conduit in a financing transaction on behalf of a thrid party 
we routinely transfer receivables to a third party in connection with equipment leased to end users 
the credit risk passes to the third party at the point of sale of the receivables 
under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities  transfers were accounted for as sales  and as a result  the related receivables have been excluded from the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the amount paid to the company for the receivables by the transferee is approximately equal to the company s carrying value and therefore the gain recognized is not material 
the end user remits its monthly payments directly to an escrow account held by a third party from which payments are made to the transferee and the company  for various services provided to the end users 
the company provides limited monthly servicing whereby the company invoices the end user on behalf of the transferee 
the off balance sheet transactions had no impact on our liquidity or capital resources 
we are not aware of any event  demand or uncertainty that would likely terminate the agreement or have an adverse affect on our operations 
application of critical accounting policies the company s financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles that are generally accepted in the united states 
the methods  estimates  and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements as they affect the updated amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the securities and exchange commission has defined critical accounting policies as policies that involve critical accounting estimates that require i management to make assumptions that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and ii different estimates that could have been reasonably used for the current period  or changes in the estimates that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  which would have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition  changes in financial condition or in results of operations 
based on this definition  our most critical policies include revenue recognition  inventory valuation reserves  allowances for doubtful accounts  which impact cost of sales and gross margin  the assessment of recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets  which impact write offs of goodwill and intangibles  depreciation of property and equipment  income taxes and legal contingencies 
we discuss these policies further below  as well as the estimates and management s judgments involved 
we also have other key accounting policies  such as policies for revenue recognition  including unbilled accounts receivable and deferred revenues  as well as policies governing the estimate of the useful life of our property and equipment 
we base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  to make judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities not readily apparent from other sources 
we believe that the estimates and judgments generally required by these policies are not as difficult or subjective and are less likely to have a material impact on our reported results of operations for a given period 
revenue recognition we recognize service revenues based on contracted fees earned  net of credits and adjustments  as the service is performed 
revenues from long term fixed unit price contracts are recognized monthly as service is performed based upon the number of units covered and the level of service requested 
the pricing in these contracts is fixed as to the unit price but varies based upon the number of units covered and service level requested 
revenues from time and material professional service contracts are recognized as services are delivered 
certain seat management contracts include the delivery and installation of new equipment combined with multi year service agreements 
revenues related to the delivery and installation of equipment under these and certain other contracts are recognized upon the completion of both the delivery and installation 
invoices billed in advance are recognized as revenues when earned 
revenues are a function of the mix of long term services contracts and time and material professional services 
revenues from time and material professional services are difficult to forecast because of wide fluctuations in demand 
the long term contracts are more predictable and  as a result  the revenues stream is less difficult to forecast 
the gross margins on long term contracts vary inversely with the call volume received from customers in any one reporting period 
our expectation is that we will see continued growth in long term contracts  which historically have had higher gross margins  and continued downward pressure on hardware and software margins 
provision for loss contracts  if any  are recognized in the period in which they become determinable 
historically  we have had few loss contracts 
at march   we had no loss contracts 
our gross margin should benefit from revenues growth and continued cost containment strategies implemented 
our gross margin varies based on the level of long term professional services compared to product volume  including the mix of types of product being sold 
inventory valuation reserves we write down inventory and record obsolescence reserves for estimated excess and obsolete inventory equal to the cost of inventory and the estimated fair value based upon anticipated future usage  prior demand  equipment use  current and anticipated contracts and market conditions 
although we strive to ensure the accuracy of our forecast for inventory usage  a significant unanticipated change in technology could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported value 
if actual demand is less than anticipated  or if our prior usage to support our contracts and anticipated future demand changes  we would be required to record additional inventory reserves  which would have a negative impact on our gross margins 
for the last three years  our inventory reserve ranged from to of inventory 
the annual charge for fiscal year is projected to be approximately thousand  or to of inventory 
a change in estimate would have an impact on earnings of approximately thousand 
accounts receivable we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we base our estimates on the aging of our accounts receivable balances and our historical write off experience  net of recoveries 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  additional allowances may be required 
we believe the accounting estimate related to the allowance for doubtful accounts is a critical accounting estimate because changes in it can significantly affect net income and treatment of the allowance requires us to anticipate the economic viability of our customers and requires a degree of judgment 
our estimate of bad debt expense is approximately 
of revenues 
a change in the estimate by would have an impact on earnings of approximately thousand 
over the past three years bad debts expense represented approximately 
to of revenues 
goodwill and other acquired intangibles we have adopted sfas no 
business combinations and sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
accordingly we no longer amortize goodwill  but will continue to amortize other acquisition related costs 
during fiscal year  amortization of acquisition related intangibles was thousand  down from thousand of amortized goodwill and acquisition related intangibles and costs in fiscal year we assign useful lives for long lived assets based on periodic studies of actual asset lives and our intended use for those assets 
we assess the impairment of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate these carrying values may not be recoverable 
any changes in these asset lives would be reported in our statement of operations as soon as any change in estimate is determined 
there have been no material changes in asset lives during the three fiscal years ended march  our impairment review is based on a market approach that uses valuation ratios for publicly traded companies based on the ratio of market price of their stock and or invested capital to various financial parameters 
halifax has been designated as a single reporting unit for financial reporting purposes 
under this method  we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value inclusive of goodwill 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying value there is no impairment and no further analysis is necessary 
if our revenues and cost forecasts are not achieved  we fail to have continued profitability and market acceptance  or the market conditions in the stock market cause the valuation to decline  we may incur charges for impairment of goodwill 
property and equipment we estimate the useful lives of property and equipment in order to determine the amount of depreciation and amortization expense to be recorded during any reporting period 
the majority of our equipment is depreciated over three to ten years 
the estimated useful lives are based on historical experience with similar assets as well as taking into account anticipated technological or other changes 
if technological changes were to occur more rapidly than anticipated or in a different form than anticipated  the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened  resulting in the recognition of increased depreciation and amortization in future periods 
we review for impairment annually or when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable over the remaining lives of the assets 
in assessing impairments  we follow the provisions of sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  utilizing cash flows which take into account management s estimates of future operations 
income taxes and valuation allowance deferred income taxes are provided for the effect of temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities recognized for financial reporting purposes and the amounts recognized for income tax purposes 
we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that  if changed  would result in either an increase or decrease in the provision for income taxes in the period of change 
a valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in assessing the likelihood of realization  management considers estimates of future taxable income  the character of income needed to realize future tax benefits  historical financial results adjusted for non recurring items and all other available evidence 
management believes that based on the weight of the evidence  consistent past profitability and estimates of future profitability that the valuation allowance established in prior years is no longer necessary 
note to the consolidated financial statements contains an analysis of our deferred tax assets 
management will continue to monitor its historical results when adjusted for non recurring items  estimates of future profitability and all other evidence to assess the realizability of its net deferred tax assets based on evolving business conditions 
should management determine it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized  this would have a significant effect on net income 
recent accounting pronouncements in april  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued sfas  rescission of fasb statements no 
 and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
sfas no 
requires the classification of gains and losses from extinguishments of debt as extraordinary items only if they meet certain criteria for such classification in apb no 
 reporting the results of operations  reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual  and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
any gain or loss on extinguishments of debt classified as an extraordinary item in prior periods that does not meet the criteria in accounting principles board or apb no 
must be reclassified 
these provisions are effective for fiscal years beginning after may  additionally  sfas no 
requires sale leaseback accounting for certain lease modifications that have economic effects similar to sale leaseback transactions 
these lease provisions are effective for transactions occurring after may  we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
during the three months ended june  at march   and  we did not record any after tax extraordinary gains on the early extinguishment of debt 
in may  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
this statement establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability or an asset in some circumstances 
many of those instruments were previously classified as equity 
some of the provisions of sfas no 
are consistent with the current definition of liabilities in fasb concepts statement no 
 elements of financial statements 
the remaining provisions of sfas no 
are consistent with the fasb s proposal to revise that definition to encompass certain obligations that a reporting entity can or must settle by issuing its own equity shares  depending on the nature of this relationship established between the holder and the issuer 
sfas no 
is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june   except for mandatorily redeemable financial instruments of nonpublic entities 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation on no 
consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of accounting research bulletin arb no 
fin requires the primary beneficiary to consolidate a variable interest entity vie if it has a variable interest that will absorb a majority of the entity s expected losses if they occur  receive a majority of the entity s expected residual returns if they occur  or both 
fin applies immediately to vies created after january   and to vies in which the entity obtains an interest after that date 
for vies acquired before february   the effective date is april  the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on the company s results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
our other results of operations and other forward looking statements contained herein involve a number of risks and uncertainties  in particular  plans to cultivate new business  the ability to expand our footprint  revenues  pricing  gross margins and costs  capital spending  depreciation and amortization  and potential future impairment of goodwill 
in addition to the factors discussed above  other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include but are not limited to the following business and economic conditions in the areas we serve  possible disruption in commercial activities related to terrorist activities  reduced end user purchases relative to expectations  pricing pressures and excess or obsolete inventory and variations in inventory values 
we believe that we have the enterprise maintenance solutions offerings  facilities  personnel and competitive resources for continued business success 
however  future revenues  costs  margins and profits are influenced by a number of factors  including those discussed above  all of which are difficult to forecast 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates  primarily as a result of bank debt to finance our business 
the floating interest rate exposes us to interest rate risk  with the primary interest rate exposure resulting from changes in the prime rate 
it is assumed in the table below that the prime rate will remain constant in the future 
adverse changes in the interest rates or our inability to refinance our long term obligations may have a material negative impact on our operations
