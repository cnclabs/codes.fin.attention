highlights growth operating revenue net income earnings per share basic diluted assets  period end deposits  period end return on assets return on equity per share data for and all prior years was retroactively adjusted to reflect the for stock split declared during the third quarter in addition  the company changed its method of reporting merchant bankcard processing fees 
during the fourth quarter  the company began netting interchange processing expenses against merchant bankcard income 
previously  the company reported interchange processing expenses as a component of noninterest expense 
as a result  all prior period reported results for noninterest income and noninterest expense have been reclassified to reflect this method of financial reporting to enable consistent presentation of the financial results 
the reporting change had no impact on net income or earnings per share  however  the reclassifications within the line items noninterest income and noninterest expense impacts certain ratios commonly used by investor and others in assessing bank performance 
more details are provided in the discussion of noninterest income section of this report 
the company earned  in compared to  in operating revenue growth of  combined with a significant decrease in the provision for loan losses were key elements to the improvement in earnings when compared to last year 
operating revenue net interest income plus noninterest income 
table of contents growth was driven by a increase in average earning assets resulting in a increase in net interest income and an increase in noninterest income due primarily from growth in revenues from origination of residential mortgages 
the provision for loan losses for was compared to  for the year the large provision for loan losses in was primarily related to problem loans in the hotel motel industry 
assets and deposits at december  showed growth rates of and  respectively over year end core deposits  which are defined as demand deposits  interest checking  money market account  and time deposits taken in locally  constitute of december  outstanding deposits 
demand deposits were  or of total deposits at year end december  during  the company believes the following factors could impact reported financial results the bank is asset sensitive and an increase in market interest rates during will positively impact the bank s net interest margin and increase net interest income 
conversely  a decline in market interest rates will have a negative impact 
the local and regional economy and its effect on loan demand and the credit quality of existing clients with lending relationships 
oregon has been in a recession and while there are early signs of a recovery  unemployment remains high at 
long term interest rates and their impact on residential construction  residential mortgage lending  and refinancing activities of existing homeowners 
the company has benefited from refinancings of existing mortgages fueled by low interest rates  but these started to slow during the last half of increased expenses related to personnel costs and the rising costs of providing employee benefits  plus staffing and other expense related to compliance with documentation of internal control systems required by section of sarbanes oxley section and fdicia 
increased competition as two new banks are scheduled to open in the eugene  oregon market during results of operations net interest income the largest component of the company s earnings is net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income derived from earning assets  principally loans  and the interest expense associated with interest bearing liabilities  principally deposits 
the volume and mix of earning assets and funding sources  market rates of interest  demand for loans  and the availability of deposits affect net interest income 
two tables follow which analyze the change in net interest income for   and table i  average balance  analysis of net interest earnings  provides information with regard to average balances of assets and liabilities  as well as associated dollar amounts of interest income and interest expense  relevant average yields or rates  and net interest income as a percent of average earning assets 
table ii  analysis of changes in interest income and interest expense  shows the increase decrease in the dollar amount of interest income and interest expense and the differences attributable to changes in either volume or rates 
changes not solely due to volume or rate are allocated to rate 
compared to net interest income for was  an increase of  or over net interest income of  for the year  the net interest margin as a percentage of earning assets decreased by basis points  from in to in market interest rates were at a year low for most of short term market rates were relatively stable for most of  with the exception of a basis point drop in short term rates  which lowered the overnight fed funds borrowing rate and the prime lending rate in june as a result of the drop in the prime lending rate in june   the company experienced compression of its net interest margin during the 
table of contents last half of the year 
the net interest margin averaged for the first six months of as compared to for the last six months of during  earning asset yields declined as new loans were booked at low interest rates and existing loans repriced or renewed at lower interest rates  while the company s cost of funds remained relatively stable 
the stability in the company s cost of funds was due to deposits  specifically interest checking  savings  and money market accounts  which are priced at their practical floors in the current interest rate environment 
the high level of liquidity during the last six months of also negatively impacted the company s net interest margin for the year 
during the last six month of  the company had excess funds averaging  which were sold overnight or placed in short term investments 
these short term investments had an average yield of approximately  which lowered earning asset yields in the last half the year  contributing to some of the margin compression 
interest and fees earned on earnings assets during increased by  or over referring to table ii  total interest income and fees improved by  due to increased earnings asset volumes  which was partially offset by a  decline in interest income due to lower yields on earning assets 
average earning assets for were  a increase over average earning asset levels 
nearly all of the growth in earning assets was attributable to loan growth as average loans net of the allowance for loan losses for the year were up  or over referring to table i  earning asset yields declined by basis points  from in to in yields on loans  short term investments  and securities available for sale contributed to the overall decline in earning asset yields during the yield on average loans  which make up of earning asset volumes  were primarily responsible for the decline in earning asset yields during loan yields for were  a decline of basis points from loan yields of recorded during the decline in loan yields is reflective of the basis point decline in market rates in june  which lowered yields on existing loan clients  and new loans booked throughout lower interest rates 
at december   the company had approximately  in variable rate loans or of the total loan portfolio 
approximately  of variable rate loans had active interest rate floors at december  the high level of variable rate loans and the maturity structure of the company s liabilities  make the company asset sensitive  meaning that its loans will reprice faster than liabilities as interest rates change 
an increase in market interest rates improves loan yields faster than the cost of funds  thus increasing the net interest margin and net interest income 
conversely  a decrease in market interest rates lowers loan yields faster than the cost of liabilities creating compression in the net interest margin and reducing net interest income 
interest expense on interest bearing liabilities during decreased by or from referring to table i  interest expense increased by due to increased volumes  which was more than offset by a  decline in interest expense due to lower rates 
table ii shows that average interest bearing liabilities for increased by  or over  which increased interest expense for the year 
most of the increase in volume was attributable to growth in money market and now accounts 
rates paid on interest bearing liabilities fell basis points  from in to in rates on every category of interest bearing liabilities showed a decline in when compared to the company s net interest margin continued to benefit from growth in noninterest bearing deposits 
for the year  average noninterest bearing deposits grew by  or over average noninterest bearing deposits funded of total assets 
at december   total non interest bearing deposits were  and accounted for of total outstanding deposits 
if the current interest rate environment prevails throughout  the company expects the net interest margin to remain stable or decrease slightly from the net interest margin experienced during the last six months of while new loans are expected to be booked at rates lower than the present average yield on the loan portfolio  increased loan fees from construction lending and deposit and alternative funding repricing opportunities are expected to mitigate some of the expected decline in the yield on the loan portfolio 
the addition of construction lenders and increased volume of construction lending is expected to increase loan fees and thus improve yields on earning assets 
in addition  during the first six months of  approximately  of national time deposits with an average rate of will mature and  of fhlb term 
table of contents advances with an average rate of  which will present repricing opportunities for the company  which is expected to lower the cost of interest bearing liabilities 
compared to net interest income for was  an increase of  or over net interest income of  for the year  net interest margin as a percentage of earning assets decreased by basis points from in to in short term market interest rates were relatively stable during with the exception of a basis point decline in november the federal reserve aggressively lowered market interest rates during  with the prime lending rate falling basis points 
during  the company was able to maintain a high yield on its earning assets due to the activation of interest rate floors  while at the same time lowering its cost of funds 
during  the company s cost of funds remained relatively stable  while earning asset yields declined as new loans were booked at low interest rates and existing loans renewed or repriced  which deactivated interest rate floors 
the high level of nonperforming loans during was also a factor in declining loan yields 
this resulted in compression of the net interest margin throughout as evidenced by the margins reported on a quarterly basis of in first quarter  in second quarter  and in both the third and fourth quarter of interest and fees on earning assets declined by  or to  referring to table ii  total interest income and fees improved by  due to increased earning asset volumes  which was offset by a  decline in interest income due to lower yields on earning assets 
average earning assets for were  up  or over all of the growth in earning assets was attributable to loan growth as average loans increased  or 
a decline of  in average securities available for sale offset a portion of the loan growth during referring to table i  earning asset yields declined by basis points from in to in this decline resulted primarily in the drop in loan yields  which were in  down basis points from as new loans and existing loans were priced at lower yields throughout in addition  interest reversed and forgone on nonaccrual loans negatively impacted earning asset yields 
interest reversed and forgone totaled approximately or of earning assets 
at december   the company had approximately  variable rate loans or of the total loan portfolio 
interest expense on interest bearing liabilities decreased by  or 
the cost of interest bearing liabilities was in  down basis points from referring to table ii  the decline in interest expense was entirely due to the decrease in rates paid on interest bearing liabilities  which lowered interest expense by  lower rates on money market accounts  now accounts  and time deposits accounted for  or of the decrease in interest rates 
changes in liability mix and increased volumes offset this decrease by the decline in interest expense due to rates reflects the low market interest rate environment for the entire year in addition  the growth in money market accounts  savings accounts  and non interest bearing accounts allowed the company to minimize dependence on higher rate sources of funding  specifically time deposits 
the company s net interest margin continued to benefit from growth in noninterest bearing deposits 
for the year ended december   average noninterest bearing deposits were  up  or over last year 
average noninterest bearing deposits funded of total assets

the level of the allowance is determined based upon judgments regarding the size and nature of the loan portfolio  historical loss experience  the financial condition of borrowers  the level of nonperforming loans  and current general economic conditions 
additions to the allowance are charged to expense 
loans are charged against the allowance when management believes the collection of principal is unlikely 
the provision for loan losses totaled in   in  and  in the lower provision for reflects a reduction in the level of nonperforming assets throughout the year  recoveries of on a hotel motel loan charged off during  and a general improvement in credit quality of the entire loan portfolio 
the larger provision in reflects growth in the loan portfolio  specifically identified risks in the company s loan portfolio  increased loan losses in  and a general decline in economic conditions during  which specifically affected the hotel motel industry 
loan losses in the hotel motel industry in included  related to two borrowers 
the largest reduction in nonperforming assets during resulted from the foreclosure and ultimate sale of a hotel motel property that was on nonaccrual status during the first six months of the bank foreclosed on this property during the second quarter and transferred the property to other real estate owned 
a loan loss was recorded at the time of the transfer to other real estate owned 
the bank ultimately sold this property during the fourth quarter also  during  the bank operated two other motel properties classified as other real estate owned at december  both of these properties were sold during the current year 
at december   the bank had two properties classified as other real estate owned at a value of the allowance for loan losses at december  was  of loans compared to  of loans and  of loans at years end and  respectively 
the amount 
table of contents includes in specific allowance for impaired loans 
at december   the company had  of impaired loans net of government guarantees consisting of one restructure and performing loan of  and  of nonaccrual loans 
at december   the company had  of impaired loans net of government guarantees with a specific allowance assigned of at year end  the company classified  of loans as impaired with a specific allowance of  net loan charge offs were in compared to  in  and in net charge offs during in the hotel motel industry accounted for  or of total charge offs for the year and related to two borrowers in the hotel motel industry 
management aggressively provided for possible loan losses during and the first quarter of these provisions were based on the levels of impaired and internally classified loans  and anticipated foreclosures 
beginning in the second quarter of and continuing throughout the remainder of the year  the bank resolved the majority of the uncertainties surrounding its impaired loans 
resolutions were reached through foreclosure and sales of collateral as well as planned exits of approximately  of weaker credits  which resulted in an improvement in the overall credit quality of the loan portfolio 
the bank significantly reduced the provision for loan losses during the last three quarters of and expects similarly reduced provisions for the first two quarters of the projected provision in the first two quarters of will be based on current economic and market conditions 
actual results may differ materially from projections 
management believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate for estimated loan losses based on management s assessment of various factors including present past due and impaired loans  past history and loss experience  loan concentrations in specific industries  and current economic conditions 
the bank is presently evaluating and parallel testing a new methodology used to calculate the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
during  the bank transitioned from an eight point risk rating system for rating the credit quality of individual loans to a ten point risk rating system 
using the new ten point risk rating system  the bank is reviewing historical loss rates  internal migration analysis  and national loss rates associated with the new risk rating system that will assign the appropriate level of the loan loss allowance to each risk rated loan category 
the bank expects to implement the new methodology for calculating the allowance for loan losses during the second quarter the bank does not expect the implementation of the new methodology to impact reported financial results for the year noninterest income noninterest income is derived from sources other than fees and interest on earning assets 
the company s primary sources of noninterest income are service charge fees on deposit accounts  merchant bankcard activity  income derived from mortgage banking services  and gains on the sale of loans 
as previously mentioned  during the fourth quarter  the company changed its method of reporting merchant bankcard noninterest income by netting interchange processing expenses against the revenues 
previously  the company reported interchange processing expense as a component of noninterest expense 
prior period reported results for noninterest income and noninterest expense have been reclassified to reflect this method of financial reporting 
for the year  the company reclassified  of interchange processing expense from noninterest expense to noninterest income as an offset to merchant bankcard noninterest income 
in order to report consistent financial information   and  of interchange processing expense was reclassified as an offset to merchant bankcard noninterest income for the years and  respectively 
this reporting change had no impact on net income or earnings per share  however  the reclassifications within the line items noninterest income and noninterest expense impacts certain ratios commonly used by investors and others in assessing bank performance 
most notably affected is the company s efficiency ratio  which measures income generating efficiency 
this ratio is calculated by dividing noninterest expense by operating revenue 
the change in reporting lowered or improved this ratio in  and the efficiency ratio reported using the new method of reporting was   and in   and  respectively  compared to   and under the previous reporting method 

table of contents compared to year to date december  noninterest income was  up or over year the majority of growth in noninterest income was attributable to three categories 
service charges on deposit accounts were up or due to an increase in the number of clients  increased fees on analyzed business accounts  and price increases on nsf od fees that went into effect during april other fee income  principally merchant bankcard processing fees grew by or over during  the company converted to a new third party processor for its merchant bankcard processing 
during the conversion process  revenue growth slowed as processing was temporarily being handled by two different processors  which increased interchange paid processing expense 
merchant bankcard revenues historically have grown to annually  and the company expects this type of growth rate for the year mortgage banking noninterest income and gains on sales of loans totaled  in compared to for  an improvement of or 
revenues from the originations of residential mortgages accounted for of the increase as long term interest rates fell sharply during creating a surge in new home sales and refinancing of existing mortgages 
gains on the sales of loans in were  up from the reported in growth in these noninterest income categories was partially offset by a decline in loan servicing income and a decline in gains on sales of securities 
the decline in loan servicing income was due to an overall decline in the level of sold loans 
in addition  the early payoff of a participated loan resulted in a write down of of a previously recorded servicing asset 
compared to year to date december  noninterest income was  up or over for the year  noninterest income accounted for of total operating revenue net interest income plus noninterest income 
growth in noninterest income for the year was attributable to four categories 
service charges on deposit accounts increased or 
the growth in service charges reflects an increase in new clients and accounts 
in addition  lower earnings credit on analyzed accounts led to higher hard dollar fees as earnings on balances in demand accounts were not sufficient to cover the cost of services provided 
revenues from the company s merchant bankcard division continued to show double digit growth 
merchant bankcard fees for the year were  up or 
this increase was due to growth in the client base and an increase in sales volume 
sales volume for was approximately  compared to  in mortgage banking noninterest income was for the year  an increase of or 
this increase resulted from a significant increase in loan originations as interest rates were at year lows 
during  the company originated  in residential mortgage loans compared to  for the year the other noninterest income category also showed significant growth  as the company entered into new businesses and developed new revenue sources 
the consumer finance division generated compared to for in addition  the company generated in new revenues from production of cd rom statements for clients  a product of investments made in technology during the fourth quarter of finally  more than in revenues were generated in trustee fees as the company used in house attorneys to process loan documents on real estate related loans 
increased income in these categories was offset by declines in three categories 
loan servicing fees were down or reflecting a decline in the servicing portfolio throughout the year gains on sales of loans were down or 
the company sold approximately  in loans during compared to  during finally  gains on sales of securities for were compared to in  a decrease of or 
noninterest expense noninterest expense represents all expenses other than the provision for loan losses and interest costs associated with deposits and other interest bearing liabilities 
it incorporates personnel  premises and equipment  data processing and other operating expenses 
see noninterest income section for impact of change in reporting merchant bankcard noninterest income and its effect on noninterest expense reported in   and 
table of contents compared to year to date december  noninterest expense was  up  or over three categories of expenses accounted for  of the total expense increase for the year 
the increase in salaries and employee benefits was in three general categories 
salaries accounted for of the increase 
however  salaries in reflect one time executive severance expense of excluding this one time expense from  salaries were up or over last year and reflect staff additions during the last half of and the first half of  primarily related to expansion in the portland area market 
commissions paid to residential mortgage and construction lenders were up over due to the higher volume of activity during benefits and taxes in increased by over approximately of the increase was due to incentive based compensation accruals  including the bank s estimated k contribution 
for the year  the bank s incentive based compensation and k match were significantly diminished as key financial goals were not met for the year 
the remainder of the increase in benefits and taxes resulted from increased group insurance costs and payroll taxes 
premises and equipment expense in were up or over expense related to premises accounted for of the increase and reflected increased lease costs of the bank s koin center office opened earlier this year 
in addition  lease costs on the coos bay office of the consumer finance division and increased lease costs on one of the bank s eugene offices contributed to the increase 
equipment expense accounted for of the increase and includes costs related to the portland area market expansion and increased software maintenance expense on the bank s loan processing systems 
the other expense category of noninterest expense was  for  an increase of  or over other real estate expense related to operations and sales of three motel properties during accounted for of the increase in the other expense category 
in addition  repossession and collection expense related to problem loans accounted for of the increase 
most of the remaining increase in the other expense category was in professional services  which was up in compared to professional services includes legal fees  accounting fees  insurance expense  and consulting expenses 
the growth rate in noninterest expense in is expected to significantly decline when compared to salaries and benefits  professional services  occupancy expense  and expense related to other real estate owned are all expected to show much lower growth rates or decline from levels experienced in compared to year to date noninterest expense at december  was  up  or over during the third quarter  the company recorded one time executive severance expense of excluding the one time severance expense  total noninterest expense was up or 
total personnel expense for was up over excluding executive severance expense  personnel expense increased or 
an increase of in employee salaries and commissions paid on residential mortgage originations was offset by a decline in company wide incentive based compensation 
other noninterest expense categories that showed material changes include equipment expense  professional services  and other data processing expense 
equipment expense was up or due to increased depreciation and maintenance costs related to new technology investments made during the fourth quarter professional services were for the year compared to  an increase of or 
this increase reflects higher legal fees during related to the increase in problem loans 
other data processing expense increased or resulting primarily from increased on line banking expense due to the growth in the client base and transaction volume 
liquidity liquidity is the term used to define the company s ability to meet its financial commitments 
the company maintains sufficient liquidity to ensure funds are available for both lending needs and the withdrawal of deposit funds 
the company derives liquidity primarily through core deposit growth  maturity of investment securities  and loan payments 
core deposits include demand  interest checking  money market  savings  and local time deposits 
additional liquidity and funding sources are provided through the sale of loans  sales of securities  access to national cd markets  and both secured and unsecured borrowings 
core deposits at december  were of total deposits  the same percentage as december  because of seasonal construction and economic activity and client payment of various tax obligations  
table of contents the company traditionally experiences a decline in core deposits during the first quarter of the year typically resulting in funding and liquidity pressures 
during the first quarter  the company had loan production of approximately  while core deposits fell by more than  during the same time period 
the company sold approximately  in loans during the first quarter and used alternative funding sources  primarily national market time deposits to fund asset growth in this time period 
in addition  the company has deposit relationships with several large clients  the single largest client representing of total deposits 
the loss of this deposit relationship or other large deposit relationships could cause an adverse effect on short term liquidity 
the company expects to maintain these relationships and believes it has sufficient sources of liquidity to mitigate this concentration 
overnight unsecured borrowing lines have been established at various correspondent banks  the federal home loan bank of seattle and with the federal reserve bank of san francisco 
at year end december   the bank had overnight borrowing lines totaling approximately  consisting of  with the federal home loan bank of seattle   with various correspondent banks  and  with the federal reserve bank of san francisco 
the federal home loan bank borrowing line is limited to the amount of collateral pledged 
at december   the bank had approximately  in commercial real estate loans pledged as collateral pledged for this line 
the  borrowing line with the federal reserve bank of san francisco is also secured 
the  in borrowing lines with correspondent banks are unsecured lines 
at december   the bank had  in borrowings outstanding and approximately  available on established lines 
in addition  the bank is part of the state of oregon community bank time deposit program and at december  had  available from this source 
the bank s loan portfolio also contains approximately  in guaranteed government loans  which can be sold on the secondary market 
capital resources capital is the shareholder s investment in the company 
capital grows through the retention of earnings and the issuance of new stock through the exercise of incentive options 
capital formation allows the company to grow assets and provides flexibility in times of adversity 
banking regulations require the company to maintain minimum levels of capital 
the company manages its capital to maintain a well capitalized designation the fdic s highest rating 
at december   the company s total capital to risk weighted assets was  compared to at december  in september  the company paid a for stock split to shareholders of record at october  all per share data and outstanding shares from prior periods has been restated to present consistent financial information 
the company pays cash dividends on a quarterly basis  typically in march  june  september and december of each year 
the board of directors considers the dividend amount quarterly and takes a broad perspective in its dividend deliberations including a review of recent operating performance  capital levels  and growth projections 
the board also considers dividend payout ratios  dividend yield  and other financial metrics in setting the quarterly dividend 
during  the company has declared and paid cash dividends of per share for the year 
that compares to cash dividends of paid during the company projects that earnings retention and existing capital will be sufficient to fund anticipated asset growth  while maintaining a well capitalized designation from the fdic 
inflation substantially all of the assets and liabilities of the company are monetary 
therefore  inflation has a less significant impact on the company than does fluctuation in market interest rates 
inflation can lead to accelerated growth in noninterest expenses  which impacts net earnings 
during the last two years  inflation  as measured by the consumer price index  has not changed significantly 
the effects of this inflation have not had a material impact on the company 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s results of operations are largely dependent upon its ability to manage market risks 
changes in interest rates can have a significant effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the company does not use derivatives such as forward and futures contracts  options  or interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk 
other types of market risk such as foreign currency exchange rate risk and commodity price risk do not arise in the normal course of the company s business activities 
interest rate risk generally arises when the maturity or repricing structure of the company s assets and liabilities differ significantly 
asset and liability management  which among other things addresses such risk  is the process of developing  testing and implementing strategies that seek to maximize net interest income while maintaining sufficient liquidity 
this process includes monitoring contractual maturity and prepayment expectations together with expected repricing of assets and liabilities under different interest rate scenarios 
generally  the company seeks a structure that insulates net interest income from large deviations attributable to changes in market rates 
interest rate risk is managed through the monitoring of the company s balance sheet by subjecting various asset and liability categories to interest rate shocks and gradual interest rate movements over a one year period of time 
interest rate shocks use an instantaneous adjustment in market rates of large magnitudes on a static balance sheet to determine the effect such a change in interest rates would have on the company s net interest income and capital for the succeeding twelve month period 
such an extreme change in interest rates and the assumption that management would take no steps to restructure the balance sheet does limit the usefulness of this type of analysis 
this type of analysis tends to provide a best case or worst case scenario 
a more reasonable approach utilizes gradual interest rate movements over a one year period of time to determine the effect on the company s net interest income 
the company utilizes the services of the federal home loan bank s asset liability modeling software to determine the effect changes in interest rates have on net interest income 
interest rate shock scenarios are modeled in basis point increments plus or minus in the federal funds rate 
the more realistic forecast assumes a gradual interest rate movement of plus or minus basis points change in the federal funds rate over a one year period of time with rates moving up or down basis points each quarter 
the model used is based on the concept that all rates do not move by the same amount 
although certain assets and liabilities may have similar repricing characteristics  they may not react correspondingly to changes in market interest rates 
in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayment of loans and early withdrawal of time deposits would likely deviate from those previously assumed 
increases in market rates may also affect the ability of certain borrowers to make scheduled principal payments 
the model attempts to account for such limitations by imposing weights on the differences between repricing assets and repricing liabilities within each time segment 
these weights are based on the ratio between the amount of rate change of each category of asset or liability  and the amount of change in the federal funds rate 
certain non maturing liabilities such as checking accounts and money market deposit accounts are allocated among the various repricing time segments to meet local competitive conditions and management s strategies 
during  the model has shown the company is becoming more asset sensitive and projects rising margins in a rising rate environment and declining margins in a falling rate environment 
the projected decline in margins in a falling rate environment is due to the inability of the company to reprice a large portion of its interest bearing core deposits  which are at a practical floor at december  during  assuming no change in the current interest rate environment  the company expects net interest margin to stabilize or decline slightly 
the following tables show the estimated impact of interest rate changes on net interest income 
tables show results of company supplied data for both the rate shock and gradual interest rate scenarios 
the base figure of  used in both analyses represents actual net interest income for the year due to the
