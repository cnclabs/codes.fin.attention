item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this form k 
overview of the markets for our products and services we are a diversified oilfield service company that provides drilling related products and services  completion and workover related products and services and maintenance and safety related products and services 
our customers include major and independent oil and natural gas companies  other oilfield service companies and refining and petrochemical companies 
prices for oil and natural gas are subject to large fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas  market uncertainty and a variety of other factors 
any prolonged increase or decrease in oil and natural gas prices affects the levels of exploration  development and production activity as well as the entire health of the oil and natural gas industry 
demand for our drilling related products and services is directly affected by the level of exploration  development and production activity of  and the corresponding capital spending by  oil and natural gas companies 
demand for our completion and workover related products and services depends more on oil and natural gas production activity  which is less immediately affected by changes in oil and natural gas prices 
demand for our maintenance and safety related products and services is affected by the rate of plant overhauls and maintenance turnarounds as well as the overall health of the refining and petrochemical industries and  to a lesser extent  by the level of oil and natural gas exploration  development and production activity 
drilling related products and services revenue from our drilling related products and services segment constituted approximately of our total consolidated revenue 
approximately of our drilling segment revenue was generated in various international locations which include canada  brazil  europe  north africa and the middle east 
however  the most significant portion of our drilling segment revenues is generated in the united states  including the gulf of mexico 
in july  exploration and development activity levels in the united states peaked and began to decline primarily as a result of lower natural gas prices 
this decline continued through april  at which point the united states drilling rig count levels reached a low of  which was comprised of offshore rigs and land rigs 
as natural gas prices climbed and remained relatively strong  rig count levels began to recover in this increase  however  resulted entirely from an increase in land based rigs 
according to statistics published by baker hughes  the average number of rotary rigs operating in the united states was  and  for  and  respectively 
of these figures  land rigs comprised  and  respectively  and offshore rigs comprised  and  respectively  for the same periods 
the modest recovery in exploration and development activity levels in the united states has impacted our revenue and earnings generated in this market 
although the overall rig count in the united states has increased  the offshore rig count  where we experience our highest operating margins  has yet to respond to the higher levels of natural gas prices and declined slightly from we believe that the overall outlook for natural gas exploration and development activity remains positive as natural gas production continues to decline 
on a longer term basis  this shortfall will tend to reduce the industry s ability to maintain adequate supplies of natural gas in storage and should keep upward pressure on natural gas prices 
however  the extent and timing of a recovery in offshore drilling activity remains difficult to predict 
outside of the united states  the north sea remains our largest drilling segment market 
however  due to the united kingdom tax law imposing a supplementary tax on oil and natural gas profits derived from certain north sea properties  many of our customers reduced drilling activity in this region 
in july  the north sea rotary rig count reached a low of according to statistics published by baker hughes  the number of rotary rigs operating in the north sea declined from an average of in january to an average of in december  after having reached a low of in july we do not expect any marked increase in activity levels in the north sea in the near term 
as offshore drilling has stagnated over the last months  the importance of maintaining market share has become critical 
in response to this market condition  in october  we made a strategic decision to enter the directional drilling business in north america 
as a result of this decision and the growth of the united states land rig count  we have successfully increased the utilization of our mwd and down hole drilling motor fleet 
the increased utilization of our mwd and down hole drilling motor fleet during helped to offset decreases in utilization of our lwd fleet  which is primarily driven by the united states offshore rig count 
additionally  we have been working to commercialize our drs technology and our awr technology  the first new technologies to have been developed independently by pathfinder since it was acquired in march both technologies are currently being tested in live well environments 
commercialization of the drs technology has been prioritized to improve the utilization of our lwd  mwd and directional drilling services as our customers often require that this type of technology be offered by a service company as a prerequisite to submitting a bid for a drilling project or contract 
introduction of our awr technology heralds our next generation of resistivity tools  which allows for advanced resistivity measurements in both high pressure and high temperature well conditions 
both the drs and the awr are expected to be available for commercial service before the end of the second quarter of we see a waiting market for these tools in the gulf of mexico  brazil and north sea 
we believe that the commercialization of these tools will have a meaningful impact on our future results of operations 
completion and workover related products and services this sector is our second largest business segment and provided approximately of our total consolidated revenue 
revenues provided by the completion and workover segment are almost entirely derived from the united states and the gulf of mexico 
although activity levels in the completion and workover of existing oil and natural gas wells are linked to commodity prices  our completion segment is less commodity price sensitive than our drilling segment 
as a result  our completion and workover segment has and continues to provide stability during prolonged downturns in drilling activity 
we have increased our revenue capacity in this segment through capital spending in  and  which  when combined with our acquisitions  has strengthened and further diversified the operations of this segment 
maintenance and safety related products and services our maintenance and safety segment provided approximately of our total consolidated revenue and is focused in and along the gulf coast region of the united states 
although somewhat seasonal in nature  with higher activity levels in the early and latter portion of the year  this segment is primarily dependent upon the maintenance activity levels of refineries and petrochemical plants and  to a lesser extent  on the level of oil and natural gas exploration  development and production activity 
in january  we announced that we were evaluating the possible divestiture of this segment 
the net book value of this segment was approximately million at december  we anticipate that our future operating performance will be enhanced by this divestiture  as we will be able to concentrate our focus on our core business segments 
adverse weather conditions in the third quarter of  we experienced delay in completion and workover jobs due to wet weather in south texas 
however  the impact was minor in comparison to the previous year 
in  our results of operations were negatively impacted by the effects of adverse weather conditions associated with tropical storm isidore  hurricane lili and the related wet weather conditions along the gulf coast 
the impact of these adverse weather conditions began near the end of the third quarter of and continued through the early part of the fourth quarter 
results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenues 
revenues increased by million  or approximately  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was attributable to higher demand for products and services in each of our operating segments  as well as the full year effect of revenue contributions of boyd s bit service  inc boyd s  which was acquired in august and e 
m 
hobbs  lp hobbs  which was acquired in november drilling related products and services revenues increased by million  or approximately  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to the increase in land drilling activity levels in the united states of million due to our entrance into the directional drilling business in north america in october completion and workover related products and services revenues increased by million  or approximately  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was the result of increases in capacity driven by capital expenditures of million  increases in activity levels  higher utilization of our coiled tubing and cased hole wireline fleet and increased demand for our completion fluids  as well as the full year s impact of the boyd s and hobbs acquisitions of million 
maintenance and safety related products and services revenues increased by million  or approximately  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was due primarily to increased sales of our safety products and turnaround related services 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues increased by million  or approximately  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenues  cost of revenues increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the increase in cost of revenues  as a percentage of revenues  was due to the continued effects of softness in pricing  increased insurance costs and the greater contribution to our consolidated revenues from lower margin products and services  primarily from our drilling fluids businesses 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or approximately  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to additional expenses of million related to the operations of boyd s and hobbs  which were acquired during the second half of and increased personnel costs of million related to expansion efforts within our coiled tubing and directional drilling business lines 
we also experienced increased corporate costs to comply with the sarbanes oxley act of and incurred expenses associated with the our move from the nasdaq national market to the new york stock exchange 
as a percentage of revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  research and development expense 
research and development expenses increased by million  or approximately  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was the result of continued research and development spending on our pathfinder technologies  including drs and awr and other research and development initiatives 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased by million  or approximately  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was the result of depreciation associated with our continued capital expenditures  as well as additional depreciation and amortization due to our acquisitions 
interest and other expense 
interest and other expense for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million  or approximately  from million for the year december  this increase was primarily due to the increase in the amounts outstanding under our credit facility 
net income 
net income for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million  or approximately from million reported for the year ended december  year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenues 
revenues decreased by million  or approximately  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease was largely attributable to reduced activity levels within the oil and natural gas industry  including the effects of softness in pricing 
this decrease was partially offset by the million revenue contribution of boyd s  which was acquired in august and hobbs  which was acquired in november and the full year effect of million from coil tubing services  llc cts  which was acquired in may additionally  our results of operations in were negatively impacted by the effects of the adverse weather conditions previously discussed 
revenues from our drilling related products and services decreased by million  or approximately  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily attributable to a reduction in drilling activity  including the effects of softness in pricing and the adverse weather conditions previously discussed 
revenues from our completion and workover related products and services increased by million  or approximately  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  revenue increased as a result of the million revenue contributions of boyd s and hobbs  which were acquired in august and november  respectively  and the full year effect of cts of million  which was acquired in may  but was offset by the effects of lower activity levels  softness in pricing and the adverse weather conditions previously discussed 
revenues from our maintenance and safety related products and services decreased by million  or approximately  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily attributable to a reduction in the amount of turnaround activity in the petrochemical industry 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues decreased by million  or approximately  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenues  cost of revenues increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the increase in cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues was due to the effects of softness in pricing and lower utilization of our equipment and services during a period of reduced drilling and workover activity levels  as well as increased insurance costs 
in addition  our cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues was negatively impacted by our strategy of maintaining an optimal level of staffing and infrastructure to ensure that we are capable of benefiting fully from future increases in industry activity levels  as well as the adverse weather conditions previously discussed 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or approximately  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was attributable to additional expenses related to the operations of boyd s and hobbs  which were acquired in august and november  respectively  the full year effect of cts  which was acquired in may  increases in insurance costs and our strategy of maintaining an optimal level of staffing and infrastructure to ensure that we are capable of benefiting fully from future increases in industry activity levels 
this increase was partially offset by a reduction in sales incentives  bonuses and marketing expenses resulting from the decreased activity levels within the oil and natural gas industry 
as a percentage of revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  research and development expense 
research and development expenses increased by million  or approximately  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was the result of increased research and development spending on our lwd  mwd and related technologies 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased by million  or approximately  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was the result of depreciation associated with our continued capital expenditures  as well as additional depreciation and amortization due to our acquisitions of boyd s and hobbs and the full year effect of cts  which was acquired in may interest and other expense 
interest and other expense for the year ended december  was million  a decrease of million  or approximately  from million for the year december  the decrease was primarily due to an overall reduction of interest rates 
net income 
net income for the year ended december  was million  a decrease of million  or approximately  from million reported for the year ended december  critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates on an on going basis  based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the most significant areas involving management judgment and estimates are described below 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition we provide rental equipment and services to our customers on a day rate basis and recognize the related revenue on a per day basis as the work progresses 
we also provide products to customers and recognize the related revenue as items are shipped from our facilities 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
allowance for doubtful accounts we extend credit to customers and other parties in the normal course of business 
further  we regularly review outstanding receivables and provide for estimated losses through an allowance for doubtful accounts 
in evaluating the level of established reserves  we make judgments regarding our customers ability to make required payments  economic events and other factors 
as the financial condition of these parties change  circumstances develop or additional information becomes available  adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts may be required 
in the event we were to determine that a customer may not be able to make required payments  we would increase the allowance through a charge to income in the period in which that determination is made 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the difference between the book basis and tax basis of our net assets 
in providing for deferred taxes  we consider current tax regulations  estimates of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies 
we believe that our earnings during the periods when the temporary differences become deductible will be sufficient to realize the related future income tax benefits 
in certain cases where projected results indicate that realization is not likely  we have established a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to estimated realizable value 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we estimate future taxable income  considering the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies and the realizability of tax loss carry forwards 
valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes to tax laws  changes to statutory tax rates and future taxable income levels 
in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or a portion of our deferred tax assets in the future  we would reduce such amounts through a charge to income in the period in which that determination is made 
conversely  if we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net carrying amounts  we would decrease the recorded valuation allowance through an increase to income in the period in which that determination is made 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
insurance reserves we maintain insurance coverage for various aspects of our business and operations 
we retain a portion of losses that occur through the use of deductibles and retentions under self insurance programs 
we regularly review estimates of reported and unreported claims and provide for losses through insurance reserves 
as claims develop and additional information becomes available  adjustments to loss reserves may be required 
impairment of long lived assets we assess our long term assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
factors considered important  which could trigger an impairment review  include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and market capitalization relative to net book value 
our determination of impairment of long lived assets  if any  requires estimates of undiscounted future cash flows 
actual impairment charges  if any  are recorded using an estimate of discounted future cash flows 
the determination of future cash flows requires estimates based upon the most recent market and operating data for the applicable asset at the time the estimate is made  and such estimates can change based on market conditions  technological advances in the industry or changes in regulations governing the industry 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized  but are subject to annual impairment testing 
the identification and measurement of goodwill impairment involves the estimation of the fair value of reporting units 
the estimates of fair value of reporting units are based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment  which primarily incorporate management assumptions about expected future cash flows and contemplate other valuation techniques 
future cash flows can be affected by changes in industry or market conditions or the rate and extent to which anticipated synergies or cost savings are realized with newly acquired entities 
although no goodwill impairment has been recorded to date  there can be no assurances that future goodwill impairments will not occur

recent accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of apb no 
fin 
this interpretation provides guidance on the identification of  and financial reporting for  entities over which control is achieved through means other than voting rights  or variable interest entities vies 
fin originally became effective for public entities with vies created before february   at the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period starting after june  in december  the fasb issued fin r  which amended fin to extend its effective date until the first quarter of for all types of entities except special purpose entities 
in addition  fin r also limited the scope of fin to exclude certain joint ventures or other entities that meet the characteristics of businesses 
upon the applicable effective date  fin will become the guidance that determines whether consolidation is required and whether the variable interest accounting model must be used to account for existing and new entities 
as we do not maintain any vies  we do not believe that the adoption of fin will have an impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
this statement establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures  in its statement of financial position  certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
in accordance with the standard  financial instruments that embody obligations for the issuer are required to be classified as liabilities 
sfas is effective for such financial instruments  except for those that apply to mandatorily redeemable non controlling interests  entered into or modified after may   and otherwise was effective for such financial instruments  except for those that apply to mandatorily redeemable non controlling interests  at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  the adoption of sfas did not have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources our primary uses for cash are working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and principal and interest payments on indebtedness 
to the extent our cash requirements for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and principal and interest payments on indebtedness exceed our cash flow from operations  we must fund our cash requirements primarily through debt and equity financing activities 
cash flow working capital was million as of december  and million as of december  net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the increase in working capital was due to increases in activity levels and acquisitions of three companies that were consummated in the fourth quarter of the increase in cash flow from operating activities was principally attributable to higher operating levels across all business segments 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  net cash used in investing activities was principally the result of capital expenditures and acquisitions  offset by lost in hole proceeds 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  changes in net cash provided by financing activities were primarily the result of borrowings and repayments under our credit facility  including those associated with the august amendment to our credit facility in which we added a million term c loan facility as discussed more fully below 
for the year ended december   we made capital expenditures  primarily for rental tool inventory  lwd and mwd tools  wireline equipment and coil tubing units  of million  including expenditures for the replacement of equipment lost in hole 
in addition  we incurred million in research and development expenses for the year ended december  acquisitions during the fourth quarter of  we completed the acquisition of three companies continental directional corp  dutch  inc and hydracoil  inc 
headquartered in nisku  alberta  continental provides directional drilling services in western canada  a market that our directional drilling business did not previously serve 
dutch provides rental tools to drilling  completion and production businesses through its sole location in broussard  louisiana 
the acquisition of hydracoil extends the geographic reach of our cased hole logging and perforating services into the north texas market 
these three companies were acquired for total cash consideration of approximately million and approximately  shares of our common stock  valued at approximately million 
capital resources with the exception of operating leases on real property and automobile leases discussed in note of our consolidated financial statements  we have no off balance sheet debt or other off balance sheet financing arrangements 
we have not entered into any derivative or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the following table aggregates information about our contractual cash obligations in thousands as of december  payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years debt    operating leases     total     in the first quarter of  we obtained an additional revolving loan commitment of million and a supplemental term b loan of million under our credit facility 
during the third quarter of  we amended our credit facility to  among other things  include a million term c loan facility 
as so amended  our credit facility includes the following features a million term a loan facility  of which million was outstanding as of december   that amortizes over five years  matures on october  and requires that we make annual principal repayments ranging from zero in the first year to million in the fifth year  an million term b loan facility  of which million was outstanding as of december   that amortizes over six and one half years  matures on april  and requires that we make annual principal repayments of million in each of the first six years with the outstanding balance due on the maturity date  a million term c loan facility  of which million was outstanding as of december   that amortizes over three and one half years  matures on april  and requires that we make annual principal repayments of million in each of the first three years with the outstanding balance due on the maturity date  and a million revolving credit facility  of which million was outstanding as of december   that may be borrowed  repaid and reborrowed from time to time and matures on october  our credit facility provides that we may request the issuance of letters of credit 
outstanding letters of credit reduce the available amount that we may borrow under our revolving credit facility 
as of december   approximately million in letters of credit had been issued under our credit facility to guarantee payment of claims for commercial insurance purposes 
these letters of credit are issued for a period of one year  with automatic one year extensions 
partial drawings against each letter of credit are permitted 
at our option  amounts borrowed under the credit facility bear interest at either a variable rate equal to the reserve adjusted libor or an alternate base rate  plus  in each case  an applicable margin 
the applicable margin ranges from to in the case of a libor based loan under the revolving loan facility or the term a loan facility  is equal to in the case of a libor based loan under the term b loan facility and is equal to in the case of a libor based loan under the term c loan facility 
for alternate base rate loans  the applicable margin ranges from to under the revolving loan facility and the term a loan facility  is equal to under the term b loan facility and is equal to under the term c loan facility 
the foregoing margins are subject to adjustment based on a debt service coverage ratio and a leverage ratio 
our credit facility is secured by a lien on substantially all of our property and assets  a pledge of all of the capital stock of our material domestic subsidiaries and a pledge of not greater than of the capital stock of each of our foreign subsidiaries 
in addition  our credit facility is guaranteed by all of our material domestic subsidiaries 
the credit facility requires  among other things  that we maintain certain financial ratios and limits the amount of capital expenditures we may make  the amount of debt we may incur outside of the credit facility  the amount of future investments and our ability to pay dividends 
as of december   we were in compliance with these restrictive covenants 
as of december  and  respectively  we had outstanding borrowings under our credit facility of million and million  respectively  of which million and million  respectively  were outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
in connection with the cts acquisition in may  we issued million in convertible subordinated notes to eight individuals as partial consideration for the acquisition of cts 
the notes were paid in full in january future capital requirements we anticipate that acquisitions of complementary companies  assets and product lines will continue to play an important role in our business strategy 
while there are currently no unannounced agreements or ongoing negotiations for the acquisition of any material businesses or assets  such transactions can be effected quickly and may occur at any time 
likewise  we will continue to need to make capital expenditures for tools and equipment and to make research and development expenditures to maintain and improve the quality of our products and services 
we currently estimate that we will make capital expenditures of approximately to million in and will make research and development expenditures of approximately to million in we believe that our internally generated cash flow  combined with access to our credit facility will be sufficient to meet the liquidity requirements necessary to fund our operations  capital expenditure requirements  research and development and debt service requirements for at least the next months 
however  our ability to maintain our credit facility and the sufficiency of our internally generated cash flow can be impacted by economic conditions outside of our control 
the continuation of our acquisition strategy will require substantial capital 
we currently intend to finance future acquisitions through issuances of our equity or debt securities and through borrowings under our credit facility 
using debt to complete acquisitions could substantially limit our operational and financial flexibility and using stock could dilute the ownership interests of our existing shareholders 
the extent to which we will be able or are willing to use our common stock to make acquisitions will depend on its market value from time to time and the willingness of potential sellers to accept it as full or partial payment 
if we are unable to obtain additional capital on acceptable terms  we may be unable to grow through acquisitions 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to market risks 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
we have not entered into derivative or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
our market risk could arise from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rate risk 
we are subject to market risk exposure related to changes in interest rates 
assuming our current level of borrowings  a basis point increase in interest rates under these borrowings would have increased our interest expense by approximately million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  foreign currency exchange risk 
our earnings and financial position are affected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
we currently do not hedge against foreign currency translation risks and we believe that foreign currency exchange risk is unlikely to be significant to our operations 
stock price volatility 
our ability to raise capital at a reasonable cost of capital is  in part  affected by the market price of our stock 
the market price of our stock may be influenced by many factors including variations in our earnings  variations in oil and natural gas prices  the level of exploration  development and production activity of  and the corresponding capital spending by  our customers  investor perceptions of us and other oilfield service companies and the liquidity of the market for our common stock
