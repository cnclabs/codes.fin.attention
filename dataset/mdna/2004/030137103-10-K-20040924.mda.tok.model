general during fiscal years and and the first half of fiscal year  the company experienced a lower compared to fiscal years and but consistent level of business 
the wireless infrastructure market  the company s largest market  and the semiconductor equipment market  another significant market for the company  were adversely impacted by the economic downturn 
at th e beginning of fiscal year  the company was downsizing to maintain its core strengths while continuing to operate with positive cash flow 
during fiscal year  the company began to add personnel in areas such as engineering  manufacturing and sales  and began making other investments designed to improve customer service  enhance existing products  add line extensions and accelerate the development of new products 
management believed that these steps would position the company to take advantage of opportunities and capture additional market share as the economy improved 
during the first two quarters of the current fiscal year  the markets served by the company began to show signs of breaking out of the extended downturn 
in the third and fourth quarter  the company experienced substantial increases in sales and bookings in all the major markets it serves 
booking levels for the second half of fiscal year increased over the comparabl e period of fiscal year the wireless infrastructure and semiconductor equipment markets exhibited the strongest growth 
based on information obtained from selected customers  and subject to the usual uncertainties in forecasting  the company expects a downturn in orders driven by customers inventory rationalization during the early part of fiscal year  followed by a recovery in the latter part of the year driven by continued high manufacturing levels of equipment incorporating the company s products 
the company returned to profitability in the second half of fiscal as a result of higher sales  lower precious metal costs and the effects of operating at higher  more efficient production volumes  partially offset by higher medical expenses 
sales of new products developed by the company contributed to the sales growth 
many of these new products are sold into the same markets as the company s traditional products 
accordingly  as activity increases in these markets  the company expects to realize the benefits of increased sales of traditional products and sales of products that have been introduced during the past three years 
prices have remained relatively stable during most of the economic downturn 
however  as volume from selected wireless infrastructure customers increases  the company expects that price pressure in this market will increase in addition  in order to reduce costs  many customers in the telecommunications market are outsourcing production to contract manufacturers who often attempt t o renegotiate the prices previously agreed to by the customer  creating another source of price pressure 
the company has benefited from lower precious metal costs in the current fiscal year 
as economic conditions continue to improve  the demand for preciou s metals used in the company s manufacturing processes has increased 
recently th e company has seen an increase in the market prices of these metals and has purchased quantities of them to protect against rising prices 
given current levels of demand  additional purchases will be necessary in the near future 
in response to the increased demand  as of june   the company is committed to purchase an additional million of precious metals primarily palladium and silver through the third quarter of fiscal year to protect against shortages and rising prices 
during the fiscal year ended june   the company incurred unusually high medical expenses 
medical expenses for the year were  or approximately  higher than last fiscal year 
in contrast  the company s headcount increased over the past year 
the increase in medical expenses was due primarily to an increase in claims for which the company is self insured 
the company believes that self insurance is a cost effective option for providing employees with health coverage  however  it results in fluctuations in costs from period to period 
the ability to deliver product rapidly remains important to securing orders 
as demand for the company s products increased  the company initially benefited from maintaining a high level of inventory 
the sharp increase in business quickly depleted this inventory and the company relied on higher level s of production to maintain quick turn delivery to its customers 
in response to increased booking and quoting activity  the company began increasing headcount in production and sales as early as the end of fiscal year as bookings an d sales volume sharply increased in the second half of fiscal year  the company rapidly escalated the rate of hiring to increase capacity to keep pace with the increased bookings 
this initially decreased gross margins and increased operating expenses 
however  the company believes that the additions to personnel preserved delivery lead times and improved customer service 
this positioned the company to take advantage of opportunities that arose in the second half of fiscal year and should continue to do so in the coming quarters as demand remains strong and opportunities arise in the markets the company serves 
in response to growing volume  the company has begun renovating the building it purchased three years ago next to its other facilities in huntingto n station  new york 
the company has also purchased the building that houses its microcap r product line in florida which it previously leased 
these actions are designed to improve flexibility for future product expansion 
they will als o result in an increase in capacity which will enable the company to produce certain products in higher volumes 
the combination of increased capital expenditures  increased working capital requirements and unprofitable operations during the economic downturn required the company to draw upon its cash reserves 
in response  the company has secured a million line of credit from general electric capital corporation gecc to help fund future capital expenditures

fiscal year compared with fiscal year net sales for the fiscal year ended june  were  an increase of from the  recorded in the fiscal year ended june  domestic sales increased by to  in fiscal year from  in fiscal year international sales increased by to  in fiscal year from  in fiscal year the increase in sales is due to the improved business climate in a majority of the markets the company serves 
sales growth was particularly significant in the wireless infrastructure and semiconductor equipment markets in the second half of fiscal year bookings have improved significantly from the levels experienced in fiscal year total bookings in fiscal year were  compared to  in fiscal year  representing an increase of approximately 
growth has come from a majority of the markets the company serves  but was particularly strong in the wireless infrastructure and semiconductor equipment markets 
gross margins were of net sales in fiscal year  compared to i n fiscal year the increase in gross margins is attributable to higher sales volume and the economics associated with higher production volumes  partially offset by increased labor and medical expenses and decreased precious metal recovery 
in response to increased booking and quoting activity  the company began increasing headcount in production and sales toward the end of fiscal yea r in order to increase capacity 
the additions to headcount accelerated as bookings and quoting activity increased throughout fiscal year in addition  during fiscal year  the company incurred unusually high medical expenses  the majority of which reduced gross margins 
operating expenses totaled  or of net sales  in fiscal yea r  compared to  or of net sales  in fiscal year the increase in operating expenses in absolute terms compared to the prior fiscal year is attributable to increased sales staff in response to increased booking and quoting activity and increased commissions 
the trend toward customers moving production offshore has continued 
accordingly  a growing portion of the company s sales are to customers in asia and europe 
consequently  the company continues to expand its foreign sales offices in china and europe to better service its customers 
research and development expenses for the fiscal year ended june  increased to  compared to  in the prior fiscal year 
the company has put additional emphasis on enhancements and extensions of its core product lines as well as improving the performance of its existing product s and its manufacturing processes 
the effective income tax rate for fiscal year was approximately  a s compared to for fiscal year the decrease in the effective income tax rate is primarily due to the impact of foreign tax benefits in relation to the level of pre tax income and the reduction of tax reserves due to audit settlements and updated evaluations 
as a result of the foregoing  the company reported a net income of  or per common share and per common share assuming dilution  for fiscal year  compared to a net loss of  or pe r common and diluted share  for fiscal year fiscal year compared with fiscal year net sales for the fiscal year ended june  were  a decrease of from the  recorded in the fiscal year ended june  domestic sales decreased by to  in fiscal year from  in fiscal year international sales increased by to  in fiscal year from  in fiscal year although overall sales remained at levels comparable to the prior year  there was an increase in sales of larger case size capacitors and eia case capacitors and a decline in sales of thin film products 
the increase in foreign sales is indicative of the company s customers migrating production overseas  penetratio n into the asian market and improved sales in europe 
orders have improved significantly from the lows experienced in the second quarter of fiscal year total bookings in fiscal year were  compared to  in fiscal year  representing an increase of approximately 
growth has come from the military and wireless infrastructure markets  offset partially by a decrease in orders from the medical electronics market 
gross margins were of net sales in fiscal year  compared to i n fiscal year the increase in gross margins is attributable in part to cost reduction measures implemented by the company in fiscal year in response t o the industry downturn and increased precious metal recovery  as well as the lac k of inventory write downs to net realizable value and a loss on the sale of palladium a precious metal used in the manufacture of certain core products both of which occurred in fiscal year in june  the company sold a portion of its palladium inventory to align inventory levels with anticipated demand 
operating expenses totaled  or of net sales  in fiscal yea r  compared to  or of net sales  in fiscal year the decrease in operating expenses from the prior fiscal year is attributable to decreased staff as a result of the cost reduction measures discussed above  lower severance costs and other restructuring costs  and decreased research and development spending 
operating expenses also decreased as a percentage of sale s for the same reasons 
net interest expense was  in fiscal year  compared to net interest expense of  in fiscal year the decrease in net interest expense is attributable primarily to the retiring of all outstanding bank debt in the first quarter of fiscal year the effective income tax benefit rate for fiscal year was approximately  as compared to for fiscal year the increase in the effective income tax rate is primarily due to the impact of foreign tax benefit s in relation to the low level of pre tax loss 
as a result of the foregoing  the company reported a net loss of  or per common and diluted share  for fiscal year  compared to a ne t loss of  or per common and diluted share  for fiscal year liquidity and capital resources june  march  june  cash and investments  working capital  quarter ended operating cash flow  capital expenditures  depreciation and amortization  current ratio quick ratio the company s financial position at june  remains strong as evidenced by working capital of  compared to working capital of  at june  the company s current ratio and quick ratio at june  remain strong although lower than june  the decline in the current and quick ratios is primarily due to higher percentage growth in accounts payable and accrued expense compared to current assets  and to capital expenditures  primarily due to bonus and commission accruals and timing of payments against accounts payable 
cash and investments decreased to  at june   compared to  at june  the decrease in cash and investments is primarily the result of capital expenditures and cash used for working capital to support increased levels of business 
accounts receivable increased by  to  at june  compared to  at june  the increase is primarily due to increased sales revenue and  to a lesser extent  t o certain large customers negotiating extended payment terms 
inventories increased by  to  at june   compared to  at june  primarily as a result of precious metal purchases during the year 
these purchases were made in anticipation of future production requirements and potential price increases 
the company continues to maintain high finished goods inventory levels to keep customer lead times to a minimum and maintain good customer service 
accounts payable increased by  to  at june  compared to  at june  due in part to increased purchasing activity to keep pace with higher production levels and in part to capital expenditures 
accrued expenses increased by  to  at june  compared to  at june   due to the timing of payments relating to vacation pay and payroll taxes as well as increased commission accruals as the result of increased bookings and sales and increased bonus accruals as a result of improved profits 
the company leases its facility in jacksonville  florida from a partnershi p controlled by the company s president  chief executive officer and principal stockholder under a capital lease 
the rental payments under this lease have been adjusted several times  most recently as of september  primarily to reflect certain additions to the facility and market value adjustments as required by the terms of the lease based upon independent appraisals

there can be no assurance that theses negotiations will result in the company obtaining a new credit facility or that  if obtained  the bank will approve any request by the company for an advance thereunder 
capital expenditures for the fiscal year ended june   totaled  including expenditures for buildings  machinery and equipment and planned leasehold improvements 
the company intends to use cash on hand  cash generated through operations and available credit to finance budgeted capital expenditures  primarily for equipment acquisition  of approximately  in fiscal year aggregate contractual obligations as of june  mature as follows payments due by period in s less than after contractual obligations total year y ears years years bank debt capital lease obligations    operating leases   purchase obligations   total contractual obligations    the company committed to purchase an additional  of precious metals primarily palladium and silver over the next twelve months to protect against shortages and rising prices 
the company has benefited from lower precious metal costs during the last fiscal year 
however  as economic conditions improve  the demand for the precious metals the company uses in its manufacturing processes is increasing throughout the electronics industry and other industries 
as a result  the company has seen a rise in the market prices of these metals 
the company routinely enters into binding and non binding purchase obligations in the ordinary course of business  primarily covering anticipated purchases of inventory and equipment 
the terms of these commitments generally do not extend beyond six months 
none of these obligations are individually significant 
the company does not expect that these commitments will materially adversely affect its liquidity in the foreseeable future 
critical accounting policies the securities and exchange commission sec has issued disclosure guidance for critical accounting policies 
the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require the application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and ma y change in subsequent periods 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to its consolidated financial statements contained in item financial statements and supplementary data of this report 
the company believes that the following accounting policies require the application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments allowances for doubtful accounts receivable the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and adjusts credit limits based upon payment history and a customer s current creditworthiness  as determined by its review of the customer s current credit information 
the company continuously monitors collections and payments from it s customers and maintains an allowance for estimated credit losses based upon its historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that the company has identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within the company s expectations and the allowances established  the company cannot guarantee that it will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that i t has in the past 
should the financial position of its customers deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to pay amounts due  the company s revised estimate of such losses and any actual losses in excess of previous estimates may negatively impact its operating results 
sales returns and allowances in the ordinary course of business  the company accepts returns of product s sold for various reasons and grants sales allowances to customers 
while the company engages in extensive product quality control programs and processes  it s level of sales returns is affected by  among other things  the quality of its manufacturing processes 
the company maintains an allowance for sales returns and allowances based upon historical returns and allowances granted 
while such returns and allowances have historically been within the company s expectations actual return and allowance rates in the future may differ from current estimates  which could negatively impact its operating results 
inventory valuation the company values inventory at the lower of aggregate cost first in  first out or market 
when the cost of inventory is determined by management to be in excess of its market value  such inventory is written down to its estimated net realizable value 
this requires the company to make estimates and assumptions about several factors eg  future sales quantities and selling prices  and percentage complete and failure rates for work in process based upon historical experience and its projections for future periods 
changes in factors such as the level of order bookings  the product mix of order bookings and the company s manufacturing processes could have a material impact on the company s assessment of the net realizable value of inventory in the future 
valuation of deferred tax assets the company regularly evaluates its ability to recover the reported amount of its deferred income taxes considering several factors  including its estimat e of the likelihood of the company generating sufficient taxable income in future years during the period over which temporary differences reverse 
presently  th e company believes that it is more likely than not that it will realize the benefits of its deferred tax assets based primarily on its history of taxable income and projections for taxable income in the future 
in the event that actual results differ from its estimates or the company adjusts these estimates in future periods  the company may need to establish a valuation allowance against a portion or all of its deferred tax assets  which could materially impact its financial position or results of operations in future periods 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets the company assesses the recoverability of long lived assets whenever the company determines that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
its assessment is primarily based upon its estimate of future cash flows associated with these assets 
the company believes that the carrying amount of its long lived assets is recoverable 
however  should its operating results deteriorate  or anticipated new product launches not occur or not attain the commercial acceptance that the company anticipates  the company may determine that some portion of its long lived assets are impaired 
such determination could result in non cash charges to income that could materially affect its financial position or results of operations for that period 
inflation the company does not expect the effects of inflation to have a significant impact on its liquidity or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company has identified four market risks relative to its business foreign currency exchange rate risk  commodity price risk  security price risk and interest rate risk 
the company has managed its market risk exposures in order to minimize their potential impact on its consolidated financial conditio n and results of operations 
specifically a foreign currency exchange rate risk 
with the exception of sales by the company s wholly owned subsidiary in sweden which are denominate d in krona  all transactions are  and are anticipated to be  denominated in us dollars 
fluctuations in exchange rates could impact revenues with an offsetting impact on costs and expenses 
the impact on net earnings at the present time would not be material 
b commodity price risk 
the company uses certain precious metals in the manufacturing of its products primarily palladium  gold and silver  and is therefore subject to certain commodity price risks 
the compan y believes that  based upon its current levels of production and inventories of precious metals  it will need to buy additional quantities of precious metals during the next year 
the price of precious metals have begun to rise due to the higher demand coming from the electronics industry and other industries 
consequently  the company has purchased a quantity of these metals to protect against rising prices and has committed to purchasing additional amounts of palladium and silver over the next year in order to lock in current market prices 
if the market price of silver or palladium were to decrease  the company would be required to purchase the palladium or silver at above market prices 
should the company need to buy gold during the next year it will do so at the prevailing market price 
c security price risk 
the company s current portfolio of marketable securities consists of us treasury notes and other government securities with varying maturities of up to three years 
the company believes it can effectively manage any exposure resulting from declining prices by holding any securities which decline substantiall y in value until maturity 
d interest rate risk 
the company earns interest income on cash and investment balances and pays interest on debt incurred 
in light of the company s existing cash  results of operations  the terms of its debt obligations and projected capital needs  it does not believe tha t a significant change in interest rates would have a significant impac t on its consolidated financial position
