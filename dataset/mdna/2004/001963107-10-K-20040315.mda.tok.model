item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview asv designs  manufactures and sells rubber tracked  all purpose crawlers and related accessories and attachments 
asv also manufactures rubber tracked undercarriages  which are a primary component on caterpillar s multi terrain loaders 
asv s products are able to traverse nearly any terrain with minimal damage to the ground  making it effective in industries such as construction  landscaping and agriculture 
asv distributes its products through an independent dealer network in the united states  canada  australia  new zealand and portugal 
the undercarriages sold to caterpillar are incorporated by caterpillar in their multi terrain loader products and sold exclusively through the caterpillar dealer network  primarily in north america 
asv experienced a significant increase in sales in due to several reasons as explained below o the company believes there is a greater acceptance of rubber track machines in the marketplace as users experience the benefits that a rubber track machine can provide over a standard wheeled machine 
o the number of companies entering into the rubber track machine market has increased in the last few years  thereby contributing to the increased awareness and market acceptance of the products 
o asv has increased its number of product offerings over the past few years  such that it has become easier to attract prospective dealers to carry the r series posi track product line 
o caterpillar has increased the number of mtl models it offers to its dealers  from two models in to five in in addition  the number of caterpillar dealers that are able to carry the mtl product line has increased from pilot dealers in to all north american dealers approximately in o the current low interest rate environment has provided for easier financing by end users 
o recent tax legislation has provided increased depreciation allowances allowing end users to depreciate a greater portion of machine purchases in the first year of ownership  thereby potentially reducing the cost of machine ownership in the first year of operation 
critical accounting policies the following discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations is based upon its financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and expenses  and related disclosures 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to accounts receivable  inventories and warranty obligations 
by their nature  these estimates and judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience  observance of trends in the industry  information provided by customers and other outside sources and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable 
revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the company generally obtains oral or written purchase authorizations from customers for a specified amount of product at a specified price and considers delivery to have occurred at the time of shipment 
asv maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of asv s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  cost being determined on the first in  first out method 
adjustments to slow moving and obsolete inventories to the lower of cost or market are provided based on historical experience and current product demand 
the company does not believe its inventories are subject to rapid obsolescence 
the company evaluates the adequacy of the inventories carrying value quarterly 
warranties 
asv provides for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while asv engages in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers  asv s warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from asv s estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability may be required 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain statements of earnings data as a percentage of net sales year ended december  net sales gross profit selling  general administrative expense research development operating income net earnings net sales 
for the year ended december   net sales totaled million  a increase over net sales for the year ended december  due to several factors 
first  the company had increased shipments of undercarriages to caterpillar for use on caterpillar s mtl product line 
shipments increased as caterpillar had more models available to sell during five compared with two 
in addition  during  caterpillar was unable to sell two models of its mtls due to production issues unrelated to asv s undercarriages 
these production issues were resolved in and these two models were placed back into production  which resulted in increased sales of these models by caterpillar in second  asv introduced a new model to its r series product line  the rc  in the first quarter of this model replaced the model posi track and the rc experienced three times the unit volume in that the had in also  the company believes the addition of the rc posi track has aided the sales of the company s other models  the rc and rc  as the increased number of product offerings has attracted an increased number of dealers that wish to carry the company s products 
also contributing to the increased sales in was the increase in the sale of service parts  as the number of machines and mtl undercarriages continues to increase 
for the year ended december   net sales totaled million  an decrease over net sales for the year ended december  due to several offsetting factors 
first  the company had no machine sales of the private label version of the rc all surface loader under its alliance with polaris  the asl  in  which had accounted for million of sales in second  the company had decreased sales of its and series posi tracks  due to the introduction of additional mtl models in and the continued softness in the overall construction equipment sales market 
partially offsetting these decreases were increased mtl undercarriage sales of million  as asv began supplying undercarriages for two additional mtl models that were introduced by caterpillar in the company also experienced increased sales of million from its r series product line due to the introduction of the rc and r products in the first quarter of in addition  sales of service parts increased in as the number of machines and undercarriages in the field continued to increase 
gross profit 
gross profit for the year ended december  was million  or of net sales  compared with million  or of net sales for the increase in gross profit was due to a combination of increased sales in as discussed above and an increase in the gross profit percentage 
the increase in gross profit percentage was due to two primary factors 
first  the increased sales of asv branded machines  which generally carry a higher gross profit percentage than mtl undercarriages  help increase the gross profit percentage in second  the company s mix of mtl undercarriages sold in contained a greater number of higher margin undercarriages than was sold in in  the company primarily sold one model of mtl undercarriage to caterpillar  which had the lowest gross profit percentage of the mtl undercarriages 
for the year ended december   gross profit was million  or of net sales  compared with million  or of net sales  for the decrease in gross profit was due primarily to the decreased sales for the increase in the gross profit percentage was due to the following offsetting factors 
first  as discussed above  the company had no polaris asl sales in  which carry a lower gross profit than the company s other products  thereby causing an increase in the gross profit percentage for compared to second  the company had increased sales of service parts in  which generally carry a higher gross profit than finished goods 
offsetting these increases  the company sold a greater concentration of lower margin mtl undercarriages in as compared to as caterpillar was not able to produce its two larger mtl models for the majority of due to a production issue unrelated to asv s undercarriage 
in addition  the company experienced fewer sales of its higher margin model posi track as discussed above 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december  the increase was due primarily to several factors 
first  commissions to asv s sales force increased in due to the increased sales 
second  in the second quarter of  selling  general and administrative expenses were lower than historical levels due primarily to the reversal of a portion of a remarketing reserve during the second quarter of the company had previously established a remarketing reserve of  for any expected costs associated with remarketing existing machines at one customer s locations  some of which were ultimately returned to company 
asv had originally anticipated these machines would be remarketed to other dealers  but instead chose to have certain of these machines returned to asv for use in its new rental program which began in the second quarter of as these machines were returned to asv and reflected as sales returns with a corresponding decrease in gross profit of approximately  a portion of the remarketing reserve was no longer needed 
the company reversed the portion of the remarketing reserve that related to the returned machines  which decreased selling  general and administrative expenses by approximately  third  payroll taxes increased in due to the exercise of non qualified stock options by employees which required the payment of the employer portion of payroll taxes by the company 
in  there were no non qualified stock options exercised due to the lower price of the company s common stock 
for the year ended december   selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to million compared with million for the year ended december  the decreased level of expenses was due to the following two items 
first  in  the company established a remarketing reserve of  as discussed above 
the company reversed the portion of the remarketing reserve that related to the returned machines  which decreased selling  general and administrative expenses by approximately  in second  the company had decreased commissions to caterpillar as the number of commissionable products sold to caterpillar dealers decreased in research and development 
research and development expenses decreased to  for the year ended december  compared with  for the year ended december  the decrease was due to the completion of the development  testing and integration of the fifth undercarriages used in caterpillar s mtl product line in in  asv incurred research and development expenses of million related to the undercarriages used in caterpillar s mtl product line 
for the year ended december   research and development expenses decreased  to  compared with  for the year ended december  this decrease was due primarily to the completion of the development  testing and integration of the fifth undercarriage used in caterpillar s mtl product line in the third quarter of the company anticipates its research and development expenses will be in the range of to of net sales in the future and will be focused on improvements to its existing products and extensions of its product lines 
other income expense 
interest expense remained relatively unchanged in compared with as debt levels and interest rates were similar in and other income for the year ended december  decreased to  compared with  for the year ended december  the decrease was due to lower interest income from lower interest rates available for the company s cash equivalents and a reduction in royalty revenues received from one of the company s vendors as the royalty agreement expired in for the year ended december   interest expense decreased to approximately  compared with approximately  for the year ended december  the decrease was due to the company refinancing approximately  of its long term debt from to for a five year term in december other income was approximately  for  compared with approximately  for the decrease in was due primarily to lower interest income from lower interest rates and decreased short term investments as the company used these investments to fund operations in net earnings 
net earnings increased for the year ended december  to million  compared with million for the year ended december  the increase was due to the more than doubling of net sales in  combined with an increased gross profit percentage  offset in part by slightly higher operating expenses  lower non operating income and a higher effective income tax rate 
for the year ended december   net earnings increased to approximately  compared with approximately  in the increase in net earnings was due to lower operating expenses and an increased gross profit percentage  offset in part by decreased sales and an increased effective income tax rate

included in this figure was the significant increase in net earnings the company experienced in due to a increase in sales 
the company also recorded a tax benefit from the exercise of stock options and a warrant of approximately million in this was due to a large increase in the exercise of employee stock options  a result of the increase in the price of the company s common stock in the company was also able to reduce its inventories by million  the majority of which resulted from increased sales of the company s rc product in in addition  used equipment levels decreased million as a result of the company holding its first used equipment auction in april the company used million of cash to invest in property  plant and equipment 
financing activities generated an additional million as the company received million of net proceeds from the exercise of stock options and a warrant in for  the company anticipates sales in the range of million  with earnings expected to be in the range of 
per share on a diluted basis 
the company anticipates its sales of mtl undercarriages to caterpillar could exceed million 
the company s payment terms from caterpillar are generally net days 
table of contractual commitments the following table represents the company s contractual obligations at december  payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt capital lease obligation  operating leases purchase obligations   financing guarantee purchase obligations represent the total value of all open purchase orders for the purchase of raw materials and components used in the manufacture of the company s products as of december  financing guarantee is described in note l to the financial statements filed in connection with this annual report on form k 
caterpillar revenue recognition gross profit the company recognizes as sales its cost for the mtl undercarriages  as defined in the alliance agreement between the company and caterpillar  plus a portion of the anticipated gross profit that caterpillar expects to recognize upon sale of the mtls to caterpillar dealers  when the company ships undercarriages to caterpillar 
on january   the company s portion of the anticipated gross profit that caterpillar expects to recognize upon sale of the mtls to caterpillar dealers will be reduced by for two of the three undercarriages the company currently sells to caterpillar 
on january   the company s portion of the anticipated gross profit that caterpillar expects to recognize upon sale of the mtls to caterpillar dealers will be reduced by for the other undercarriage the company currently sells to caterpillar 
the company believes these revisions will not cause its overall gross profit percentage generated on the sale of mtl undercarriages in to fall below the overall gross profit percentage it generated on the sale of mtl undercarriages for the year ended december  the mtl undercarriages are not a commissionable product under the company s commercial alliance agreement with caterpillar
