overview novavax is a fully integrated specialty biopharmaceutical company focused on the research  development and commercialization of products utilizing our proprietary drug delivery and vaccine technologies for large and growing markets  concentrating on the areas of women s health and infectious diseases 
we currently market  sell and distribute a line of prescription pharmaceutical and prenatal vitamins through our sales force  have recently completed the build out of a manufacturing facility for our newly approved product  are conducting research and development on preventative vaccines and proteins  are developing new products using our drug delivery technology and are expanding our management team to meet our strategic objectives 
our micellar nanoparticle technology involves the use of patented oil and water emulsions that we believe can be used as vehicles for the topical delivery of a wide variety of drugs and other therapeutic products  including hormones 
we believe that our technology represents the first time that ethanol soluble hormones  such as estrogen and testosterone  have been encapsulated and delivered 
in october  we received our first commercial product approval utilizing our micellar nanoparticle technology 
estrasorb  the first topical emulsion for estrogen therapy  was approved by the food and drug administration for the treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms hot flashes associated with menopause 
the approval of estrasorb was a major milestone for novavax that has presented us with numerous current and future opportunities and challenges 
to successfully launch estrasorb and continue to develop future products using our drug delivery vehicle  we will need to focus our efforts and financial resources on the development of marketing plans and programs to effectively compete in the highly competitive estrogen therapy market the expansion and training of our current sales force the manufacturing of products at commercial quantities and at acceptable gross margins the identification and development of future product candidates  and the the recruitment of management and key personnel we believe the approval of estrasorb will provide us access to capital and human resources which previously were more difficult to obtain 
following the approval of estrasorb we raised approximately million in november through the public offering of  shares of common stock 
we may decide  or be required  to obtain additional financing  depending on the initial success of estrasorb  our marketing programs and our strategic objectives  and our success in identifying product development candidates 
in addition  over the past few months we have added key senior management personnel in the areas of sales  marketing  human resources and vaccine development and we will continue to expand our senior management team as well as add key personnel 
in preparation for the launch of estrasorb  we have developed the initial marketing strategies and programs with king pharmaceuticals  inc  our marketing partner  and we will be expanding our sales force from to approximately employees in the next few months 
we will also be dedicating significant financial and human resources to create awareness about estrasorb and our unique drug delivery system 
in  we entered into an agreement with cardinal health  inc to lease a  square foot facility within its existing facility in philadelphia  pa 
we have recently completed the build out of this facility to our specifications and have installed the manufacturing equipment to accommodate commercial production of estrasorb 
we have substantially completed the validation of the facility and equipment and are manufacturing bulk product as well as packaging the product 
this facility was designed to be able to produce commercial quantities that we believe could meet our marketing requirements for the next to years 
however  due to the costs associated with maintaining a facility at full capacity  until our production requirements reach a certain level our initial gross margins will be lower than industry averages 
we believe we can significantly lower our costs of goods and improve our margins as we increase production quantities 
in addition  we have already begun to design alternative packaging solutions to streamline production and lower costs of production 
while the majority of our efforts will be placed on the successful launch of estrasorb and the development of future products  we will continue to support and market our existing line of women s health products and look for opportunities to expand our products though the acquisition or further development of our prenatal vitamin line 
in august and september we also received a grant and a contract from the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases which could total up to million in revenues for the design and development of a new series of human immunodeficiency virus candidates for preclinical and clinical studies 
the contract and grant cover four to five year periods and are the largest awards we have received to date 
to meet the requirements of the contracts over their terms  we will need to enhance and expand the capabilities of our current lab facilities which  when completed  will allow us to qualify for other grants and contracts in the vaccine area 
critical accounting policies and changes to accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we base our estimates on historical and anticipated results and trends and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  including assumptions as to future events 
these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
by their nature  estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
actual results that differ from our estimates could have a significant adverse effect on our operating results and financial position 
we believe that the following significant accounting policies and assumptions may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity than others 
for further discussion of our accounting policies see footnote summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements attached as an exhibit to this annual report on form k 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with the provisions of staff accounting bulletin no 
for our product sales  revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred to our distributor  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we recognize these sales net of allowances for returns  rebates and chargebacks 
a large part of our product sales are to distributors who resell the products to their customers 
we provide rebates to members of certain buying groups who purchase from our distributors  to distributors that sell to their customers at prices determined under a contract between us and the customer that administer various programs such as the federal medicaid and medicare programs 
rebate amounts are usually based upon the volume of purchases or by reference to a specific price for a product 
we estimate the amount of the rebate that will be paid  and record the liability as a reduction of revenue when we record our sale of the products 
settlement of the rebate generally occurs from three to months after sale 
we regularly analyze the historical rebate trends and make adjustments to recorded reserves for changes in trends and terms of rebate programs 
in a similar manner  we estimate amounts for returns based on historical trends and adjust those reserves as product returns occur 
the shipping and handling costs we incur are included in cost of sales in the accompanying statements of operations 
for up front payments and licensing fees related to our contract research or technology  we defer and recognize revenue as earned over the life of the related agreement 
milestone payments are recognized as revenue upon achievement of contract specified events and when there are no remaining performance obligations 
revenues earned under current research contracts are recognized per the contracts terms and conditions for invoicing of costs incurred and defined milestones 
in  revenue earned under research contracts was recognized on the percentage completion method whereby revenue was recognized in proportion to the estimated percentage to complete the contract 
during the fourth quarter of  we reassessed the remaining costs and progress on four contracts 
based on this review we determined that estimated costs to complete had been underestimated throughout the year 
we reevaluated the estimated costs to complete on all contracts and the effect of this reevaluation was an  reduction to revenue   of which related to two of the contracts  with no corresponding reduction in expenses 
the impact of this adjustment affects previously disclosed revenues in our quarterly reports 
we have shown the quarterly effects of these adjustments in item herein 
research and development costs research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
we will continue to incur research and development costs as we expand our product development activities in our women s health and vaccine programs 
our research and development costs have included  and will continue to include  expenses for internal development personnel  supplies and facilities  clinical trials  regulatory compliance and reviews  validation of processes and start up costs to establish commercial manufacturing capabilities 
at the time our new product candidates are approved by the fda and we begin commercial manufacturing  we will be allocating costs at our manufacturing location to inventory or as research and development costs  depending on whether we are operating at or near our potential capacity 
in  we will be allocating our costs to manufacture estrasorb to inventory 
as a result  our research and development costs will decrease and our inventory and cost of sales will increase 
depreciation and amortization depreciation of furniture  fixtures and equipment is provided under the straight line method over the estimated useful lives  generally to years 
amortization of leasehold improvements is provided over the estimated useful lives of the improvements or the term of the lease  whichever is shorter 
in we substantially completed the build out and validation of our new manufacturing facility in philadelphia 
in addition  we have purchased  validated and installed manufacturing equipment in preparation for the commercial launch of estrasrob in the total investment in the facility and equipment is approximately million 
we will begin recognizing amortization or depreciation on these assets when manufacturing for commercialization begins in early at that time  the yearly amortization and depreciation expense is estimated to be from to million per year 
goodwill and intangibles assets goodwill and intangible assets principally result from business acquisitions  such as the million of goodwill we recognized for our acquisition of fielding pharmaceuticals in december assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their fair values  the excess of the purchase price over the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
intangible assets other than goodwill are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives  ranging from to years 
the company periodically evaluates the periods of amortization to determine whether later events and circumstances warrant revised estimates of useful lives 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  under these rules  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are subject to impairment tests annually or more frequently should indicators of impairment arise 
other intangible assets continued to be amortized over their useful life beginning in the first quarter of the company utilizes a discounted cash flow analysis  which includes profitability information  estimated future operating results  trends and other information in assessing whether the value of indefinite lived intangible assets can be recovered 
under sfas no 
 goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value 
in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 
 the company tested its goodwill for impairment as of january  and determined that no impairment was present 
in the fourth quarters of and  the company performed the required annual impairment test on the carrying amount of its goodwill  which indicated the company s estimated fair value of goodwill exceeded it carrying value  therefore  no impairment was identified at december  or if the appraisal had determined that the goodwill was impaired  the write down would have increased our net loss by a comparable amount 
accounting for co promotion agreement under the terms of our co promotion agreement with king we will be responsible for manufacturing  receiving orders  invoicing and distribution of estrasorb 
thus  we will record all of the product sales  returns and allowances and cost of sales for estrasorb 
the resultant gross margin will be shared equally with king  subject to a limitation on cost of goods sold  and the payment to king will be recorded as a selling and marketing expense on our statement of operations 
under the co promotion agreement  both parties will share equally in approved marketing expenses for the product 
all direct marketing expenses will be recorded by us  net of king s fifty percent reimbursement 
stock options we apply the principles of apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  in accounting for stock options issued to our employees which generally does not require that options granted to employees be expensed 
had we applied the fair value principles of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  for our employee options  our net loss for the years ended december   and would have increased to approximately million  million and million  respectively  as compared to approximately million  million and million  respectively 
the financial accounting standards board has indicated it will likely require that companies expense employee options in the future  but it has not yet finalized the timing or methods for such a change 
guarantee in april  we executed a conditional guaranty of a brokerage margin account for a director  in the amount of  prior to demanding payment from the company  the brokerage firm must first make demand for payment to the director and then liquidate the account 
thereafter  if there remains a shortfall  they may demand payment from the company 
as of december  and  the company has not recorded any liability on its balance sheet related to this guarantee as we believe the possibility of required payment by the company to be unlikely 
results of operations for fiscal years  and revenues change from change from revenues vitamins gynodiol avc line other total product sales contract research milestone and licensing fees revenues for the fiscal year ended december  were million compared to million in and million in this represents a year to year decrease of million  or  and million  or  for the years ending december  and  respectively 
of the million total revenue decrease from to  a decline in product sales accounted for million of that shortage 
the product sales decrease was attributable to an overall decline in our prenatal vitamin lines due to generic competition offset by slightly higher sales from the gynodiol product line and the fourth quarter introduction of our new prenatal vitamins  novanatal and novastart 
milestone revenue decreased by approximately million  primarily due to a one time recognition of million on a milestone payment in contract research revenue increased million from million in to million in the revenue decrease from to relates to a decline in product sales from million in to million in  a decrease of million  a decline in contract research revenue from million in to million in  a decline of million  and a decline in milestone and license fee revenue from million in to million in  a decrease of million 
product sales were negatively impacted in primarily due to an decline in sales for our prenatal vitamin line as a result of increasing competitive pressure from generic alternatives  as well as declines in avc cream and gynodiol sales in due to first year sales promotions following our acquisition of these products in the reduction in contract research revenues was due to a one time payment for a contract in and a change in accounting for contract research revenues in from the percentage of completion method to recognition upon completion of all contract terms 
the reduction in milestone and license fee revenues was primarily due to the one time recognition of a million milestone received from king in for the timely filing of the nda for estrasorb 
net losses change from change from net loss net loss per share weighted shares outstanding net loss for was million  or per share  compared to million  or per share for  and million  or per share in the decreased loss of million from to related primarily to the million reduction of sales and marketing expenses that was incurred in principally for the anticipated product launch of estrasorb  
million reductions in general and administrative expenses for similar reasons  million reductions in research and development  as described below  offset by revenue reductions of million  as previously discussed 
the increased loss of million from to related primarily to reduced product sales of million  a reduction in contract research revenues of million  a decrease in milestone revenues of million as previously described  increases in selling and marketing expenses of million in preparation of the anticipated approval and product launch of estrasorb  and an increase of million in research and development expenses for manufacturing start up activities 
operating costs and expenses change from change from operating costs and expenses cost of sales research and development selling and marketing general and administrative cost of sales cost of sales was million in  compared to million in and million in the year to year decreases  in both and  were primarily due to decreases in product sales for the same periods 
as a percentage of sales  cost of sales decreased to in from and increased to from in  due to product mix and sampling protocols which changed per the product mix year to year 
research and development expenses research and development expenses were million in  compared to million for  and million for the decrease of million  or  from to was primarily attributable to decreased spending in our vaccines programs  offset slightly by increased spending on manufacturing start up costs related to preparing our manufacturing facility for commercial production of estrasorb 
the increase from to of million  or  was primarily due to increases in manufacturing start up costs as we prepared for the manufacturing of estrasorb  offset by decreases in for clinical trial and nda preparation costs when compared to the manufacturing start up costs relate primarily to facility lease expenses  validation services  product stability testing and personnel costs 
reconciliation of significant research and development projects the following table reconciles the direct and indirect costs tracked and incurred to date for our major projects to our total research and development expense 
project estrasorb androsorb infectious disease vaccines allocated project costs other unallocated costs total estimated cost and time to complete major projects the expenditures that will be necessary to execute our business plan are subject to numerous uncertainties  which may adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources 
as of december   our proprietary product candidates were in early stages of development 
due to the inherent nature of product development  future market demand for products and factors outside of our control  such as clinical results and regulatory approvals  we are unable to estimate the completion dates and the estimated total costs for those product candidates 
the duration and the cost of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of differences arising during clinical trial protocol  including  among others  the following number of patients that ultimately participate in the trial  duration of the patient follow up that seems appropriate in view of the results  number of clinical sites included in the trials  and length of time required to enroll suitable patient subjects 
in addition  we test our potential products in numerous preclinical studies to identify  among other things  the daily dosage amounts 
we may conduct multiple clinical trials to cover a variety of indications for each product candidate 
as we obtain results for our trials we may elect to discontinue clinical trials for certain product candidates or indications 
we further believe that it is not possible to predict the length of regulatory approval time 
factors that are outside our control could significantly delay the approval and marketability of our product candidates 
as a result of the uncertainties discussed above  among others  the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects are difficult to estimate and are subject to numerous variations 
our inability to complete our research and development projects in a timely manner could significantly increase our capital requirements and could adversely impact our liquidity 
these uncertainties could force us to seek additional  external sources of financing from time to time in order to continue with our business strategy 
for more discussion of the risk and uncertainties and our liquidity  see risks and uncertainties and liquidity and capital resources 
selling and marketing expenses selling and marketing expenses were million in  million in and million in the costs variances on a year to year basis are primarily the result of the variations in marketing expenses associated with the anticipated product launch for estrasorb 
of these total selling and marketing costs  marketing costs represented million  million and million for the years ending   and  respectively  which accounts for the yearly fluctuations 
in anticipation of fda approval for estrasorb occurring in  the company began incurring costs associated with actively developing marketing materials and programs for the product launch 
later  the company withdrew its application 
this decision  and the related decision to defer marketing estrasorb until we received approval  resulted in the variances in marketing costs 
since receiving approval in october  we have accelerated our marketing programs and we expect to incur increasing costs for our launch of estrasorb 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses were million is  compared to million in and million in the reduction of million in over was due to major reductions in administrative and executive personnel and other expenses in the second half of  resulting from the delay in the approval of estrasorb 
these reductions continued through the third quarter of  at which time we began rehiring in anticipation of the estrasorb approval 
the reduction from to of million was primarily due to the accounting change for goodwill amortization  as described above in goodwill and intangible assets  offset by increases in administrative and executive personnel to support our growth for anticipated initiation of commercialization activities for estrasorb and increases in legal costs related to patent filings and research contract reviews 
interest income expense change from change from interest income expense interest income interest expense net interest expense was million in  million in  and million in our interest expenses relate primarily to the promissory notes with king  which increased from million in to million in net interest expenses remained relatively unchanged from to the increase from to of million was due to the issuance of an additional million note to king  and to a lesser extent overall lower cash balances in liquidity and capital resources our capital requirements depend on numerous factors  including but not limited to the marketing and manufacturing costs related to the launch of estrasorb  the commitments and progress of our research and development programs  the progress of preclinical and clinical testing  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the costs of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  competing technological and market developments  and changes in our development of commercialization activities and arrangements 
we plan to have multiple products in various stages of product development and we believe our research and development as well as selling  marketing and general administrative expenses and capital requirements will continue to increase 
future activities  including the development of sales and marketing programs  the expansion of commercial scale manufacturing capabilities and clinical development  are subject to our ability to raise funds through debt or equity financing  or collaborative arrangements with industry partners 
in addition to product and contract research revenues of million from through december   we have financed our operations primarily from in millions total proceeds from notes with king proceeds from king for licensing and milestone payments private placement of  shares of common stock public offering of  shares of common stock proceeds for exercise of stock options and warrants cash and cash equivalents were million at december   an increase of million from the december  balance of million 
the increase during the year was primarily due to the net proceeds from two sales of common stock totaling million 
in february  we completed the private placement of  shares of common stock at per share for net proceeds of million  and in november we completed the sale of  shares of common stock at per share for net proceeds of million 
these two financing activities were offset by million of cash used for operating activities and million used for capital expenditures in cash used for operating activities in decreased by million from million used in of the million used for operating activities  we used approximately million to fund the activities in our research and development operations  which included clinical trials for estrasorb  preparing our manufacturing operations for commercial production and vaccine contract research 
the million for capital expenditures in  which was a decrease of million from the million used in  was primarily for manufacturing equipment and the validation of our manufacturing equipment and facility in philadelphia 
working capital was million at december  compared to million at december  the increase of million in working capital was primarily due to the cash flow activities described above 
as noted in the overview  we received fda approval for estrasorb in october we currently anticipate that the commercial launch of estrasorb will occur in the second quarter of during  we will be incurring substantial costs to support the selling  marketing and manufacturing expenses associated with the initial year of commercial production  recruiting and retaining personnel and developing marketing programs necessary for the launch of estrasorb 
we will not receive any receipts from potential product sales of estrasorb until a few months after the initial shipments  and our sales for estrasorb and subsequent cash receipts will probably not offset the expenses noted above 
in addition to the costs related to estrasorb  we will incur increasing costs in to build our senior management team and to develop our other product candidates that will be using our drug delivery technology 
the company will continue to pursue raising capital through the public or private sale of securities of the company 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to raise additional financing or that if such financing is available  that the terms of the financing will be satisfactory to the company 
if we are unable to raise additional capital  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of  or eliminate one or more of our product research and development programs  downsize our sales force  reduce or defer our marketing expenses  or reduce general and administrative infrastructure 
based on our assessment of the availability of capital and the above described actions  in the absence of new financing  we believe we will have adequate resources to meet our obligations as they become due 
contractual obligations and commitments the following table summarizes our current obligations and commitments less than after commitments obligations total year years years years convertible notes operating leases financing leases manufacturing facility lease total commitments obligations item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily through its investments in cash equivalents 
the company s investment policy requires investments in short term  low risk instruments 
at december   the company had million in cash and cash equivalents 
if interest rates fall  floating rate securities will generate less interest income 
the company does not believe that it is exposed to any material interest rate risk as a result of its investments in cash equivalents 
at december   the company has total debt of million  most of which bears interest at fixed interest rates 
thus the company does not believe that it is exposed to any material interest rate risk as a result of its borrowing activities
