the replacement of the bonds with funding through lines of credit provided us with a significant interest expense reduction as the lines of credit had a lower interest rate 
depreciation and amortization per weighted average gla decreased slightly from per square foot in the period to per square foot in the period due to a lower mix of tenant finishing allowances included in buildings and improvements which are depreciated over shorter lives ie over lives generally ranging from to years as opposed to other construction costs which are depreciated over lives ranging from to years

construction of an additional  square foot expansion of the center was completed during the third quarter and opened occupied 
the cost of the expansion was approximately million 
the sevierville center now totals approximately  square feet 
in may  we completed the sale of our  square foot property located in martinsburg  west virginia

the results of the charter oak portfolio have been included in the consolidated financial statements since december  the acquisition of the charter oak portfolio solidifies our position in the outlet industry 
in addition  the centers acquired provide an excellent geographic fit  a diversified tenant portfolio and are in line with our strategy of creating an increased presence in high end resort locations 
we will have joint control with blackstone over major decisions 
if blackstone does not receive an annual minimum cash return of on their invested capital during any of the first three years and in any year thereafter  blackstone shall gain the right to become the sole managing member of the joint venture with complete authority to act for the joint venture  including the ability to dispose of one or more of the joint venture properties to a third party 
based on current available cash flows from the properties  we do not believe there is a significant risk of default under this provision 
we will provide operating  management  leasing and marketing services to the properties and will earn an annual management and leasing fee equal to per square foot of gross leasable area 
we may also earn an additional annual incentive fee of up to approximately  if certain annual increases in the net operating income are met on an annual basis 
these fees are payable prior to  and are not subordinate to  any member distributions that may be required 
blackstone shall have the right to terminate the management agreement for the joint venture if it does not receive its minimum cash return as described above 
after an initial month lock up period  either party can enter into an agreement for the sale of the charter oak portfolio  subject to a right of first offer of the other party to acquire the entire portfolio

blackstone will then receive an additional annual preferred cash distribution 
we will then receive a distribution equal to our invested capital and an additional annual preferred cash distribution

twmb associates  llc in september  we established the twmb associates  llc twmb  a joint venture in which we have a ownership interest with rosen warren myrtle beach llc rosen warren as our venture partner  to construct and operate a tanger outlet center in myrtle beach  south carolina 
the company and rosen warren each contributed million in cash for a total initial equity in twmb of million 
in june the first phase opened leased at a cost of approximately million with approximately  square feet and brand name outlet tenants 
during  we completed our  square foot second phase 
the second phase cost approximately million 
the company and rosen warren each contributed approximately million each toward the second phase which contains additional brand name outlet tenants 
in addition  twmb is currently underway with a  square foot third phase expansion of the myrtle beach center with an estimated cost of million 
twmb expects to complete the expansion with stores commencing operations during the summer of the company and rosen warren each made capital contributions during the fourth quarter of of million for the third phase 
upon completion of this third phase in  twmb s myrtle beach center will total  square feet 
at december   commitments for construction of the third phase expansion amounted to million 
commitments for construction represent only those costs contractually required to be paid by twmb 
in conjunction with the construction of the center  twmb closed on a construction loan in the amount of million with bank of america  na agent and southtrust bank due in september as of december  the construction loan had a balance of million 
in august of  twmb entered into an interest rate swap agreement with bank of america  na effective through august with a notional amount of million 
under this agreement  twmb receives a floating interest rate based on the day libor index and pays a fixed interest rate of 
this swap effectively changes the payment of interest on million of variable rate debt to fixed rate debt for the contract period at a rate of 
all debt incurred by this unconsolidated joint venture is collateralized by its property as well as joint and several guarantees by rosen warren and the company 
either partner in twmb has the right to initiate the sale or purchase of the other party s interest at certain times 
if such action is initiated  one member would determine the fair market value purchase price of the venture and the other would determine whether they would take the role of seller or purchaser 
the members roles in this transaction would be determined by the tossing of a coin  commonly known as a russian roulette provision 
if either rosen warren or we enact this provision and depending on our role in the transaction as either seller or purchaser  we could potentially incur a cash outflow for the purchase of rosen warren s interest 
however  we do not expect this event to occur in the near future based on the positive results and expectations of developing and operating an outlet center in the myrtle beach area 
deer park enterprise  llc during the third quarter of  we established a wholly owned subsidiary  tanger deer park  llc tanger deer park 
in september  tanger deer park entered into a joint venture agreement with two other members to create deer park enterprise  llc deer park 
all members in the joint venture have an equal ownership interest of 
deer park was formed for the purpose of  but not limited to  developing a site located in deer park  new york with approximately  square feet planned at total buildout 
we expect the site will contain both outlet and big box retail tenants 
each of the three members made an equity contribution of million 
in conjunction with the real estate purchase  deer park closed on a loan in the amount of million with fleet bank due in october and a purchase money mortgage note with the seller in the amount of million 
deer park s fleet loan incurs interest at a floating interest rate equal to libor plus and is collateralized by the property as well as joint and several guarantees by all three parties 
the purchase money mortgage note bears no interest 
however  interest has been imputed for financial statement purposes at a rate which approximates fair value 
in october  deer park entered into a sale leaseback transaction for the above mentioned real estate located in deer park  new york 
the agreement consists of the sale of the property to deer park for million which is being leased back to the seller under a month operating lease agreement 
under the provisions of fasb statement no 
accounting for costs and initial rental operations of real estate projects  current rents received from this project  net of applicable expenses  are treated as incidental revenues and will be recognized as a reduction in the basis of the assets  as opposed to rental revenues over the life of the lease  until such time that the current project is demolished and the intended assets are constructed 
any developments or expansions that we  or a joint venture that we are involved in  have planned or anticipated may not be started or completed as scheduled  or may not result in accretive net income or funds from operations 
in addition  we regularly evaluate acquisition or disposition proposals and engage from time to time in negotiations for acquisitions or dispositions of properties 
we may also enter into letters of intent for the purchase or sale of properties 
any prospective acquisition or disposition that is being evaluated or which is subject to a letter of intent may not be consummated  or if consummated  may not result in an increase in net income or funds from operations 
preferred share redemption on june   we redeemed all of our outstanding series a cumulative convertible redeemable preferred shares the preferred shares held by the preferred stock depositary in the form of depositary shares  each representing th of a preferred share 
the redemption price was per preferred share per depositary share  plus accrued and unpaid dividends  if any  to  but not including  the redemption date 
in total   of the depositary shares were converted into  common shares and we redeemed the remaining  depositary shares for per share  plus accrued and unpaid dividends 
we funded the redemption  totaling approximately  from cash flows from operations 
financing arrangements during  we purchased  at a premium  million of our outstanding senior  unsecured public notes that mature in october the purchases were funded by amounts available under our unsecured lines of credit 
these purchases bring the total amount of these notes purchased in the last three years to million 
we currently have authority from our board of directors to purchase an additional million of our outstanding senior  unsecured public notes and may  from time to time  do so at management s discretion 
at december   approximately of our outstanding long term debt represented unsecured borrowings and approximately of the gross book value of our real estate portfolio was unencumbered 
the average interest rate  including loan cost amortization  on average debt outstanding for the years ended december  and was and  respectively 
we intend to retain the ability to raise additional capital  including public debt or equity  to pursue attractive investment opportunities that may arise and to otherwise act in a manner that we believe to be in our shareholders best interests 
prior to the and common share offerings  we had established a shelf registration to allow us to issue up to million in either all debt or all equity or any combination thereof 
in september  we completed a public offering of  common shares at a price of per share  receiving net proceeds of approximately million 
we used the net proceeds  together with other available funds  to acquire one outlet center in howell  michigan  to reduce the outstanding balance on our lines of credit and for general corporate purposes 
in december  we completed a public offering of  common shares at a price of per share  receiving net proceeds of approximately million 
the net proceeds were used together with other available funds to finance our portion of the equity required to acquire the charter oak portfolio of outlet shopping centers and for general corporate purposes 
in addition in january  the underwriters of the december offering exercised in full their over allotment option to purchase an additional  common shares at the offering price of per share 
we received net proceeds of approximately million from the exercise of the over allotment 
to generate capital to reinvest into other attractive investment opportunities  we may also consider the use of additional operational and developmental joint ventures  selling certain properties that do not meet our long term investment criteria as well as outparcels on existing properties 
we maintain unsecured  revolving lines of credit that provide for unsecured borrowings up to million at december   an increase of million in capacity from december  during  we extended the maturity of all lines of credit to june  based on cash provided by operations  existing credit facilities  ongoing negotiations with certain financial institutions and our ability to sell debt or equity subject to market conditions  we believe that we have access to the necessary financing to fund the planned capital expenditures during we anticipate that adequate cash will be available to fund our operating and administrative expenses  regular debt service obligations  and the payment of dividends in accordance with real estate investment trust reit requirements in both the short and long term 
although we receive most of our rental payments on a monthly basis  distributions to shareholders are made quarterly and interest payments on the senior  unsecured notes are made semi annually 
amounts accumulated for such payments will be used in the interim to reduce the outstanding borrowings under the existing lines of credit or invested in short term money market or other suitable instruments 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table details our contractual obligations over the next five years and thereafter as of december  in thousands contractual obligations thereafter debt       operating leases       our debt agreements require the maintenance of certain ratios  including debt service coverage and leverage  and limit the payment of dividends such that dividends and distributions will not exceed funds from operations  as defined in the agreements  for the prior fiscal year on an annual basis or of funds from operations on a cumulative basis 
we have historically been and currently are in compliance with all of our debt covenants 
we expect to remain in compliance with all our existing debt covenants  however  should circumstances arise that would cause us to be in default  the various lenders would have the ability to accelerate the maturity on our outstanding debt 
we operate in a manner intended to enable us to qualify as a reit under the internal revenue code the code 
a reit which distributes at least of its taxable income to its shareholders each year and which meets certain other conditions is not taxed on that portion of its taxable income which is distributed to its shareholders 
based on our taxable income to shareholders  we were required to distribute approximately million in order to maintain our reit status as described above 
we distributed approximately  to common shareholders based on our current dividend level  which significantly exceeds our required distributions 
if events were to occur that would cause our dividend to be reduced  we believe we still have an adequate margin regarding required dividend payments based on our historic dividend and taxable income levels to maintain our reit status 
the following table details our commercial commitments as of december  in thousands commercial commitments lines of credit  unconsolidated joint venture construction commitments  unconsolidated joint venture guarantees  we currently maintain four unsecured  revolving credit facilities with major national banking institutions  totaling million 
as of december  amounts outstanding under these credit facilities totaled million 
all four credit facilities expire in june we are party to a joint and several guarantee with respect to the million construction loan obtained by twmb 
we are also party to a joint and several guarantee with respect to the million loan obtained by deer park 
we are only responsible for a guarantee equal to our ownership interest percentage of one third 
see joint ventures section above for further discussion of the guarantees 
related party transactions as noted above in unconsolidated joint ventures  we are a owner of the twmb joint venture 
twmb pays us management  leasing and development fees for services provided to the joint venture 
during and  we recognized approximately  and  in management fees   and  in leasing fees and  and  in development fees 
market risk we are exposed to various market risks  including changes in interest rates 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
to manage our exposure to interest rate changes  we negotiate long term fixed rate debt instruments and from time to time enter into interest rate swap agreements 
the swaps involve the exchange of fixed and variable interest rate payments based on a contractual principal amount and time period 
payments or receipts on the agreements are recorded as adjustments to interest expense 
at december   twmb had an interest rate swap agreement effective through august with a notional amount of million 
under this agreement  twmb receives a floating interest rate based on the day libor index and pays a fixed interest rate of 
this swap effectively changes the payment of interest on million of variable rate construction debt to fixed debt for the contract period at a rate of 
the fair value of the interest rate swap agreement represents the estimated receipts or payments that would be made to terminate the agreement 
at december   twmb would have paid approximately  to terminate the agreement 
a decrease in the day libor index would increase the amount paid by twmb by  to approximately  the fair value is based on dealer quotes  considering current interest rates and remaining term to maturity 
twmb does not intend to terminate the interest rate swap agreement prior to its maturity 
the fair value of this derivative is currently recorded as a liability in twmb s balance sheet  however  if held to maturity  the value of the swap will be zero at that time 
the fair market value of long term fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk 
generally  the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
the estimated fair value of our total long term debt at december  was million while the recorded value was million  respectively 
a increase from prevailing interest rates at december  would result in a decrease in fair value of total long term debt by approximately million 
fair values were determined from quoted market prices  where available  using current interest rates considering credit ratings and the remaining terms to maturity 
critical accounting policies we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
principles of consolidation the consolidated financial statements include our accounts  our wholly owned subsidiaries  as well as the operating partnership and its subsidiaries 
intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 
investments in real estate joint ventures that represent non controlling ownership interests are accounted for using the equity method of accounting 
under the provisions of fin  we are considered the primary beneficiary of our joint venture  coroc 
therefore  the results of operations and financial position of coroc are included in our consolidated financial statements 
in january of  the fasb issued fin which clarifies the application of existing accounting pronouncements to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
the provisions of fin are effective immediately for all variable interests in variable interest entities created after january   and we will apply its provisions to any variable interests in variable interest entities existing as of january  as of march  and thereafter 
certain of the disclosure requirements apply to all financial statements issued after january   regardless of when the variable interest entity was established 
we have evaluated deer park  which was created after january  note and have determined that under the current facts and circumstances we will not be required to consolidate this entity under the provisions of fin we are in the process of evaluating twmb associates  llc twmb  a joint venture in which we have a ownership interest with rosen warren myrtle beach llc rosen warren as our venture partner  which was created prior to january  note in order to determine whether the entity is a variable interest entity and whether we are considered to be the primary beneficiary or whether we hold a significant variable interest 
twmb is a joint venture arrangement where it is possible that we may be required to consolidate or disclose additional information about our interest in twmb in the future

business combinations fas  we allocate the purchase price based on the fair value of land  building  tenant improvements  debt and deferred lease costs and other intangibles  such as the value of leases with above or below market rents  origination costs associated with the in place leases  and the value of in place leases and tenant relationships  if any 
we depreciate the amount allocated to building  deferred lease costs and other intangible assets over their estimated useful lives  which generally range from three to years 
the values of the above and below market leases are amortized and recorded as either an increase in the case of below market leases or a decrease in the case of above market leases to rental income over the remaining term of the associated lease 
the value associated with in place leases and tenant relationships is amortized over the expected term of the relationship  which includes an estimated probability of the lease renewal and its estimated term 
if a tenant vacates its space prior to the contractual termination of the lease and no rental payments are being made on the lease  any unamortized balance of the related deferred lease costs will be written off 
the tenant improvements and origination costs are amortized as an expense over the remaining life of the lease or charged against earnings if the lease is terminated prior to its contractual expiration date 
we assess fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and capitalization rates and available market information 
if we do not allocate appropriately to the separate components of rental property  deferred lease costs and other intangibles or if we do not estimate correctly the total value of the property or the useful lives of the assets  our computation of depreciation expense may be significantly understated or overstated 
cost capitalization we capitalize all fees and costs incurred to initiate operating leases  including certain general and overhead costs  as deferred charges 
the amount of general and overhead costs we capitalized is based on our estimate of the amount of costs directly related to executing these leases 
we amortize these costs to expense over the estimated average minimum lease term 
we capitalize all costs incurred for the construction and development of properties  including certain general and overhead costs 
the amount of general and overhead costs we capitalize is based on our estimate of the amount of costs directly related to the construction or development of these assets 
direct costs to acquire assets are capitalized once the acquisition becomes probable 
if we incorrectly estimate the amount of costs to capitalize  our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
impairment of long lived assets rental property held and used by us is reviewed for impairment in the event that facts and circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in such an event  we compare the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset to the asset s carrying amount  and if less  recognize an impairment loss in an amount by which the carrying amount exceeds its fair value 
if we do not recognize impairments at appropriate times and in appropriate amounts  our consolidated balance sheet may overstate the value of our long lived assets 
we believe that no impairment existed at december  revenue recognition base rentals are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the lease 
substantially all leases contain provisions which provide additional rents based on tenants sales volume percentage rentals and reimbursement of the tenants share of advertising and promotion  common area maintenance  insurance and real estate tax expenses 
percentage rentals are recognized when specified targets that trigger the contingent rent are met 
expense reimbursements are recognized in the period the applicable expenses are incurred 
payments received from the early termination of leases are recognized as revenue over the remaining lease term  as adjusted to reflect the early termination date 
funds from operations funds from operations ffo  represents income before extraordinary items and gains losses on sale or disposal of depreciable operating properties  plus depreciation and amortization uniquely significant to real estate and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
ffo is intended to exclude gaap historical cost depreciation of real estate  which assumes that the value of real estate assets diminish ratably over time 
historically  however  real estate values have risen or fallen with market conditions 
because ffo excludes depreciation and amortization unique to real estate  gains and losses from property dispositions and extraordinary items  it provides a performance measure that  when compared year over year  reflects the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates  rental rates  operating costs  development activities and interest costs  providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income 
we present ffo because we consider it an important supplemental measure of our operating performance and believe it is frequently used by securities analysts  investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of reits  any of which present ffo when reporting their results 
ffo is widely used by us and others in our industry to evaluate and price potential acquisition candidates 
the national association of real estate investment trusts  inc  of which we are a member  has encouraged its member companies to report their ffo as a supplemental  industry wide standard measure of reit operating performance 
in addition  our employment agreements with certain members of management base bonus compensation on our ffo performance 
ffo has significant limitations as an analytical tool  and you should not consider it in isolation  or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap 
some of these limitations are o ffo does not reflect our cash expenditures  or future requirements  for capital expenditures or contractual commitments  o ffo does not reflect changes in  or cash requirements for  our working capital needs  o although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges  the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future  and ffo does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements  o ffo may reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from matters which may not be indicative of our ongoing operations  and o other companies in our industry may calculate ffo differently than we do  limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure 
because of these limitations  ffo should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or our dividend paying capacity 
we compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our gaap results and using ffo only supplementally 
see the statements of cash flow included in our consolidated financial statements

new accounting pronouncements in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity fas  effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  the fasb initiated its liabilities and equity project in response to concerns regarding the current balance sheet classifications of certain financial instruments 
the standard specifies that instruments within its scope  which include mandatorily redeemable financial instruments  obligations to repurchase the issuer s equity shares by transferring assets  and certain obligations to issue a variable number of shares  represent obligations of the issuer and  therefore  the issuer must classify them as liabilities 
we adopted this statement effective july   and it had no impact on our results of operations or financial position 
economic conditions and outlook the majority of our leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the impact of inflation 
such provisions include clauses for the escalation of base rent and clauses enabling us to receive percentage rentals based on tenants gross sales above predetermined levels  which we believe often are lower than traditional retail industry standards which generally increase as prices rise 
most of the leases require the tenant to pay their share of property operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes  insurance and advertising and promotion  thereby reducing exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
while factory outlet stores continue to be a profitable and fundamental distribution channel for brand name manufacturers  some retail formats are more successful than others 
as typical in the retail industry  certain tenants have closed  or will close  certain stores by terminating their lease prior to its natural expiration or as a result of filing for protection under bankruptcy laws 
during  we have approximately  square feet or of our portfolio coming up for renewal 
if we were unable to successfully renew or release a significant amount of this space on favorable economic terms  the loss in rent could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we renewed of the  square feet that came up for renewal in with the existing tenants at an average base rental rate approximately equal to the expiring rate 
we also re tenanted  square feet during at a increase in the average base rental rate 
existing tenants sales have remained stable and renewals by existing tenants have remained strong 
the existing tenants have already renewed approximately  or  of the square feet scheduled to expire in as of february  in addition  we continue to attract and retain additional tenants 
our factory outlet centers typically include well known  national  brand name companies 
by maintaining a broad base of creditworthy tenants and a geographically diverse portfolio of properties located across the united states  we reduce our operating and leasing risks 
no one tenant including affiliates accounts for more than of our combined base and percentage rental revenues 
accordingly  we do not expect any material adverse impact on our results of operation and financial condition as a result of leases to be renewed or stores to be released 
as of december   occupancy at our portfolio of centers in which we have an ownership interest decreased from to compared to december  due to the acquired properties having a lower occupancy rate   than our original tanger portfolio   just prior to the acquisition 
consistent with our long term strategy of re merchandising centers  we will continue to hold space off the market until an appropriate tenant is identified 
while we believe this strategy will add value to our centers in the long term  it may reduce our average occupancy rates in the near term
