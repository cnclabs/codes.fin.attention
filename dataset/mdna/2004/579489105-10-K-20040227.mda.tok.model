item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview during  the company published newspapers in four regions of the country minnesota  california  the carolinas and the northwest alaska and washington 
the company s newspapers range from large dailies serving metropolitan areas to non daily newspapers serving small communities 
the company supplements its newspaper publishing with an array of niche products and direct marketing initiatives  including direct mail 
the company also operates leading local websites in each of its daily newspaper markets offering users information  comprehensive news  advertising  e commerce and other services 
the company also owns and operates nando media  an interactive media operation that provides newspapers with content  publishing tools and software development 
the company s primary source of revenue is advertising 
while percentages vary from year to year  and from newspaper to newspaper  local retail advertising carried as a part of newspapers run of press or rop advertising or in advertising inserts placed in newspapers preprint advertising  contributes roughly of advertising revenues at the company s newspapers 
recent trends have been for certain national or regional retailers to use greater preprint advertising and less rop advertising  although that trend shifts from time to time 
nonetheless  rop advertising still makes up the majority of retail advertising 
classified advertising  primarily in automotive  employment and real estate categories  contributes about and national advertising from national telecommunications  financial  automotive manufacturers and certain other industries contributes about of such advertising 
online advertising  direct marketing and other advertising make up the remainder of the company s advertising revenues 
circulation revenues generally contribute from to of the company s newspaper revenues  depending upon the size and locale of the newspaper 
most newspapers are delivered by independent contractors and circulation revenues are recorded net of direct delivery costs 
see results of operations  which follow for a discussion of the company s revenue performance and contribution by categories in  and critical accounting policies the accompanying discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
however  future events are subject to change and 
table of contents the best estimates and judgments routinely require adjustment 
the most significant areas involving estimates and assumptions are revenue recognition  allowance for uncollectible accounts  amortization and or impairment of intangibles  pension and post retirement expenses  insurance reserves  incentive compensation  environmental reserves  the company s tax provision and depreciation of fixed assets 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  in particular  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition advertising revenues are recorded when advertisements are placed in the newspaper and circulation revenues are recorded as newspapers are delivered over the subscription term 
circulation revenues are recorded net of direct delivery costs 
other revenue is recognized when the related product or service has been delivered 
revenues are recorded net of estimated incentive offerings including special pricing agreements  promotions and other volume based incentives 
revisions to these estimates are charged to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
allowance for uncollectible accounts the company maintains an allowance account for estimated losses resulting from the risk its customers will not make required payments 
generally  the company uses the aging of accounts receivable to establish allowances for losses on accounts receivable 
however  if the financial condition of a customer deteriorates  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances are reserved 
goodwill and intangible impairment in assessing the recoverability of the company s goodwill and other intangibles  the company must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
the company analyzes its goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment 
no material impairment loss was recorded in fiscal  or pension and post retirement benefits the company has significant pension and post retirement benefit costs and credits that are developed from actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including salary rate increases  discount rates and expected return on plan assets 
the company is required to consider current market conditions  including changes in interest rates  in establishing these assumptions 
changes in the related pension and post retirement benefit costs or credits may occur in the future because of changes resulting from fluctuations in the company s employee headcount and or changes in the various assumptions 
the company used a discount rate of  assumed salary rate increases of to and an assumed long term return on assets of to calculate its retirement expenses in fiscal see note to the consolidated financial statements for a more in depth discussion of the company s policies in setting its key assumptions related to these obligations 
tax provision the company s tax provision is based upon its estimated taxable income and includes assumptions and estimates it anticipates formalizing on its tax returns when subsequently prepared and are based upon existing tax laws 
deferred taxes are provided for temporary differences between assets and liabilities reported for financial accounting and income tax reporting purposes 

table of contents self insurance the company is self insured for workers compensation in california and alaska  and for the majority of its group health insurance costs 
the company relies on claims experience and the advice of consulting actuaries and administrators in determining an adequate provision for self insurance claims 
recent events and trends recent divestiture and acquisition on june   the company sold the assets of the newspaper network tnn  a national sales and marketing company fiscal revenues of million 
the associated press purchased tnn s ad processing operations and  separately  vertis  inc purchased tnn s sales and marketing assets 
total consideration from the sales was million including the assumption of liabilities 
the company has reclassified the assets and liabilities of tnn as held for sale in its consolidated balance sheet as of december  the revenues and operating results of tnn are included in discontinued operations in the company s consolidated statement of income in  and  as is the gain on its sale in on january   the company purchased the assets of the merced sun star  a daily newspaper in merced  california and five non daily newspapers merced group for million in cash from pacific sierra publishing  inc the merced sun star has five day circulation of  and weekend circulation of  and the merced group had revenues in its fiscal ending march of million 
the results for the merced group are not reflected in the company s financial statements prior to january  operating revenues while total advertising revenues grew in fiscal  classified advertising continued to decline  particularly in the employment category 
employment advertising  which reached million in  declined to million by the end of employment advertising revenues declined an additional to million in fiscal  but the rate of decline slowed from the second quarter of through the end of the year  with the fourth quarter declining from fiscal fourth quarter 
while print employment revenues have declined  the company s online revenues and particularly the employment category have experienced strong growth 
when print and online employment advertising are combined  employment advertising declined only for all of fiscal also  the declines in employment advertising were offset by advertising revenue growth in other categories in please see the revenue discussions below under results of operations 
operating costs newsprint prices were higher than prior year levels beginning in the second quarter of  resulting in higher newsprint expense for the year 
an increase in newsprint prices was implemented in the fourth quarter of and was followed by three additional increases in all other things being equal  a hypothetical per metric ton change in newsprint prices 
table of contents affects earnings per share by three cents annually 
the company s newsprint suppliers have announced a per metric ton price increase for february  however  at this time it is uncertain when the price increase will be effective or whether it will be in the amount indicated by the announcement 
the eventual timing and amount of any further changes in newsprint pricing is dependent on global demand and supply for newsprint 
the impact of newsprint price increases on the company s expenses is discussed under results of operations below 
the company s fringe benefit costs increased over fiscal due primarily to higher retirement and medical costs  and are expected to continue to increase in fiscal in addition  historically low long term interest rates caused the company to use a discount rate to calculate its pension and post retirement expenses in fiscal compared to a rate used in fiscal this is the primary factor in driving up retirement expenses 
continued low interest rates have resulted in the company using a discount rate of to value its year end pension obligations and to calculate its pension expense 
in addition  with an economic recovery anticipated by many analysts over the next several years  the company believes it is prudent to increase its assumed rate of salary increase from to used in to to in for its pension plans 
these factors will increase the company s pension expense in fiscal compared to see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company has contributed million to its pension plans in fiscal  and earnings on this contribution will partially offset these increases 
nonetheless  the company expects its pension and post retirement expense to increase between million to million in fiscal medical costs also rose in  and are expected to increase in fiscal between million and million 
results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal the company reported net income from continuing operations of million  or per share  compared to the fiscal year earnings from continuing operations of million  or per share 
total fiscal earnings from continuing operations included a pre tax charge of million to write down a certain internet investment 
net income including the discontinued operation was million in fiscal  or per share  compared to million  or per share  in fiscal revenues revenues from continuing operations in fiscal year increased to billion with advertising revenues up to million and circulation revenues down to million 

table of contents the following table summarizes the company s revenue by category in in thousands change advertising revenues retail national classified automotive employment real estate other total classified other total advertising circulation other total revenues while the company reviews and evaluates the operations of each individual newspaper  for purposes of organization and ease of understanding  the following table summarizes fiscal revenues at its newspaper operations by region with year over year changes minnesota california carolinas northwest revenues change revenues change revenues change revenues change revenues advertising circulation other total retail advertising grew million over fiscal due primarily to growth in preprinted advertising inserts placed into the newspapers  which was up million or 
much of this growth was from the company s three daily bee newspapers in california million and from the star tribune in minneapolis million 

table of contents national advertising increased million reflecting strong advertising from telecommunication companies at most newspapers  and banking and automotive advertising at the sacramento bee 
in fact  million of the increase in national advertising was at the sacramento bee  and the california newspapers as a group contributed million of the increase 
classified advertising declined million  due primarily to a million decline in employment advertising  offset somewhat by strong advertising growth of million in classified real estate advertising 
automotive and other classified advertising declined million with only the california newspapers showing growth in these areas 
the decline in automotive is partially due to difficult comparisons to strong growth in this category in employment advertising was down at all newspapers as this industry wide trend of lower employment advertising continued  especially at larger metropolitan newspapers 
the star tribune in minnesota and the sacramento bee recorded most of these declines by virtue of being the company s two largest newspapers 
the news observer in raleigh  nc  had significant losses of employment advertising over the last few years  however  it was one of the company s first newspapers to show an improving trend in the second half of fiscal employment revenue declined million at the star tribune  million at the sacramento bee  and  at the news observer 
real estate advertising was strong at all newspapers except for those in the carolina region  where they declined nominally due to local market conditions 
the increase in real estate advertising at the company s other newspapers reflects the national trend in this category 
other advertising revenues increased million and primarily consisted of direct marketing and internet advertising revenues  two of the fastest growing revenue sources at the company s newspapers 
direct marketing revenues increased million with much of the growth coming from the company s california newspapers million where the three bee newspapers have combined to offer direct mail programs to advertisers 
online advertising grew million or with strong growth at all newspapers  but with particularly strong growth at the sacramento bee up million and the star tribune up million 
circulation revenues declined nominally as increases at some newspapers were offset by declines at others 
each newspaper pursues its own mix of rate changes and promotional programs 
the most significant declines in circulation revenues were at the star tribune  which reflected changes in the sales mix between single copy and home delivery and promotional programs  and at the island packet and the beaufort gazette  where reclassifications of certain delivery costs to a contra revenue account decreased net circulation revenues 
other revenues declined million with much of the decline in the northwest newspapers million due to lower commercial printing revenues and at nando media  due to the company s decision to discontinue the sale of news and information content to third parties 

table of contents operating expense total operating expenses from continuing operations increased by in fiscal due primarily to higher newsprint  retirement and medical costs 
compensation costs were up reflecting salary increases and higher fringe benefit costs 
salaries increased reflecting merit increases which were offset somewhat by a decline in head count 
however  fringe benefit costs rose by  largely due to million in additional retirement and medical costs 
newsprint and supplement expense was up for fiscal  with newsprint prices up and consumption down 
other operating expenses increased due primarily to higher postage costs associated with the company s direct mail programs and to the write off of certain software fixed assets 
depreciation and amortization costs declined million  or  primarily reflecting lower capital expenditures over the last several years and the expiration of useful lives of certain assets 
non operating expenses income net interest expense was million for the fiscal year this is a decline from the fiscal year as the company benefited from lower interest rates  the expiration of two interest rate swaps and debt repayment from free cash flow 
the company also recorded  as its share of ponderay s income for the fiscal year compared to million of loss in the fiscal year the additional income from ponderay primarily reflects the favorable impact of higher newsprint prices 
the company recorded losses on the writedown of an internet investment of million in fiscal as it determined that the carrying value of the investment was permanently impaired 
also  in fiscal the company purchased a significant portion of the assets of an internet company in which it had previously invested  and as a result of the asset purchase  the company was required to write down its investment  recording a loss of million 
income taxes the company s effective income tax rate was for the fiscal year compared to for fiscal year the lower effective tax rate in primarily relates to successful resolution of certain state tax positions the company took in connection with past acquisitions 
fiscal compared to fiscal net income in the fiscal year was million  up  or per share compared to the fiscal year earnings from continuing operations of million  or per share 
this increase largely reflects the adoption in fiscal of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  which eliminated goodwill amortization 
fiscal earnings included a pre tax charge of million to write down the value of certain real property as discussed below 
the fiscal year earnings from continuing operations would have been per share if sfas no 
had been in place during that year 
see the discussion under operating expenses and income tax provision 
table of contents below  and note to the consolidated financial statements for an explanation of the impact of sfas no 
on the company s year to date expenses and financial position 
operating revenues net net revenues in the fiscal year remained virtually flat at billion  with advertising revenues up to million  and circulation revenues down to million

table of contents retail advertising revenues increased million from fiscal as growth in preprint advertising increased million  but was partially offset by declines in rop advertising of million 
this change reflects an industry wide trend toward advertising in preprinted inserts in lieu of rop advertising 
much of the retail growth came from the sacramento bee  up million  and the news observer in raleigh  nc  up million 
both newspapers had new mall openings in their markets during with the attendant grand opening advertising 
retail was generally weak at other newspapers as effects from the economic recession impacted advertisers 
national advertising was down million in fiscal compared to and declined at virtually all of the company s newspapers as national advertisers had not yet seen recovery in their businesses from the economic recession that began in  and therefore  kept advertising at lower levels 
classified advertising increased million  however  employment advertising was down million  or  from levels 
the decline in employment advertising was primarily offset by strong advertising in automotive  up million  and real estate  up million 
employment advertising was down significantly at the company s three largest newspapers the star tribune  million  the sacramento bee million  and the news observer in raleigh  nc million  but was generally down at all newspapers reflecting the industry wide trend of recent years 
the gains in automotive were largely the result of zero percent financing programs in at automotive dealers  while low interest rates fueled growth in real estate activity which was reflected in greater advertising in the company s newspapers 
other advertising revenues increased million  largely reflecting a l 
million decline in direct marketing revenues  offset by a million increase in online advertising 
the star tribune reorganized its direct marketing program to focus on more profitable projects  which improved profitability  but resulted in a million revenue decline  while the sacramento bee expanded its direct mail programs  generating a revenue increase of million 
the increase in online advertising was generally spread throughout the company s newspapers  except at the news observer  where lower online employment advertising pulled down total online advertising revenues slightly 
circulation revenues declined million and were down at most newspapers only the carolinas newspapers showed increases in circulation revenues due primarily to the reclassification of certain circulation bad debts to a contra revenue account 
this reclassification reflected uncollected revenues for newspapers distributed free to home delivery subscribers in an effort to regain subscriptions after their initial expiration date known as grace period deliveries 
this reclassification had no effect on earnings as it reduced both revenues and expenses 

table of contents other revenues declined million  with most of the decline coming from the news tribune in tacoma  wa where management declined to continue commercial printing for a large customer 
by declining to renew the printing contract  the news tribune was able to forego significant capital expenditures for press equipment that would have been required but  in management s view  offered no long term strategic benefit to the newspaper 
operating expenses total operating expenses from continuing operations decreased to million in fiscal depreciation and amortization decreased million in large part due to the adoption of sfas no 
 which eliminated the amortization of goodwill 
expenses excluding depreciation and amortization declined despite an increase in compensation  which was up  reflecting merit increases  incentive compensation increases and higher fringe benefit costs 
much of the decline in the expenses excluding depreciation and amortization was due to lower newsprint costs 
newsprint and supplements declined by with newsprint prices down and newsprint consumption down 
other operating expenses were down 
excluding a million charge to write down certain real property  other operating expenses were down  reflecting company wide cost controls 
the million charge reflected the company s decision to retain certain real property it had previously held for sale  and accordingly  wrote down the property value to its historical carrying value in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
non operating expenses income net interest expense was million for fiscal year this is a decrease from fiscal year as the company continued to benefit from lower interest rates and debt repayment from the company s cash flow 
the company also recorded million as its share of ponderay s loss in the fiscal year compared to  of income in the fiscal year the company recorded a loss on the writedown of an internet investment of million in fiscal after it purchased a significant portion of the assets of an internet company in which it had previously invested  and applied purchase accounting to the fair market value of the assets at the time of purchase 
in  the company recorded a loss of million related to four internet investments whose values were determined to be permanently impaired 
income taxes the company s effective income tax rate was versus in fiscal year this decrease results primarily from the company s adoption of sfas no 
which eliminated the non tax deductible amortization of goodwill 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources the company s cash and cash equivalents were million at december   versus million at the end of fiscal the company generated million of cash from operating activities in fiscal and has generated an aggregate of million over the 
table of contents last three years 
the major non operating uses of cash over the three year period have been to repay debt  to purchase property  plant and equipment  make pension contributions and to pay dividends 
in fiscal  the company repaid million of bank debt and has repaid million over the last three years 
the company paid million in dividends in fiscal  while proceeds from issuing class a stock under employee stock plans totaled million 
see the company s statement of cash flows on page in fiscal  the company made a voluntary contribution of million to its defined benefit pension plans 
in early fiscal it made additional voluntary contributions totaling million in order to reduce the unfunded liability of its qualified pension plans  which totaled million at december   and to help reduce pension expense with the earnings on the contributions 
given the anticipated increase in its pension obligations in resulting from pension expense  and depending on the return on pension assets and the interest rate environment  management considered the million contribution to be prudent 
the company may be required to  or may voluntarily opt to  make additional contributions to its pension plans in future years  but does not currently anticipate any additional contributions in fiscal the company expended a total of million in fiscal for capital projects and equipment from continuing operations to improve productivity  keep pace with new technology and maintain existing operations 
capital expenditures over the last three years from continuing operations have totaled million and planned expenditures in fiscal are estimated to be million at existing facilities 
the company has purchase obligations through totaling million primarily for capital expenditures see the table of contractual obligations below 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements and the table of contractual obligations and commitments below for a discussion of the company s commitments to ponderay 
a syndicate of banks and financial institutions provided the bank debt financing for the acquisition of the star tribune company under a bank credit agreement credit agreement 
at december   the company s bank debt totaled million and includes term loans consisting of tranche a of million bearing interest at the london interbank offered rate libor plus basis points  payable in increasing quarterly installments through march   and tranche b of million bearing interest at libor plus basis points and payable in semi annual installments through september  a revolving credit line of up to million  of which million was outstanding at december   bears interest at libor plus basis points and is payable by march  interest rates applicable to debt drawn down at december   ranged from to 
the terms of the credit agreement include certain operating and financial restrictions  such as limits on the company s ability to incur additional debt  create liens  sell assets  engage in mergers  make investments and pay dividends 
the debt is unsecured and is pre payable without penalty 

table of contents with the addition of a million letter of credit on january   the company currently has outstanding letters of credit totaling million securing estimated obligations stemming from workers compensation claims and other contingent claims 
the company had million of available credit under its current credit agreement at december  however  the company drew down million on its revolving credit line recently to make pension contributions  complete the merced acquisition and to repay tranche a debt  and has subsequently repaid a portion of this drawdown 
hence  its available credit at february  was million 
the company s revolving line of credit and tranche a debt both mature before the end of its first quarter of fiscal the company expects that most of its cash generated from operations in the foreseeable future will be used to repay debt 
management believes that the company s operating cash flow and its access to credit facilities are adequate to meet its liquidity needs  including currently planned capital expenditures  pension contributions and future investments 
in the company expects to re finance its existing debt facilities subject to market conditions being favorable 
the company has approximately million of unamortized loan origination fees related to its current credit facilities currently expensing  quarterly 
the balance of these fees will be written off when the re financing occurs 
the company does not have  nor does it intend to enter into  derivative contracts for trading purposes 
the company has not attempted to hedge fluctuations in the normal purchases of goods and services used to conduct its business operations 
currently there is no intent to hedge or enter into contracts with embedded derivatives for the purchase of newsprint  ink  and other inventories  leases of equipment and facilities  or business insurance contracts 
the company utilizes interest rate protection agreements swaps to help maintain the overall interest rate risk parameters set by management 
none of these agreements were entered into for trading purposes 
the swap instruments were entered into to match the significant terms of the underlying debt in an effort to provide highly effective hedges 
the company currently has one interest rate swap agreement designated as a cash flow hedge specifically designed to hedge interest rate fluctuations on million of its variable rate bank debt through june the effect of this agreement is to fix the libor interest rate exposure at approximately on that portion of the company s term loans

table of contents risk factors that could affect operating results forward looking information this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements regarding the company s actual and expected financial performance and operations 
these statements are based upon our current expectations and knowledge of factors impacting our business  including  without limitation  statements about return on pension plan assets and assumed salary increases  newsprint costs  amortization expense  use of derivative instruments  prepayment of debt  capital expenditures  sufficiency of capital resources and possible acquisitions 
such statements are subject to risks  trends and uncertainties 
forward looking statements are generally preceded by  followed by or are a part of sentences that include the words believes  expects  anticipates  estimates  or similar expressions 
for those statements  we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward looking statements contained in the private securities litigation reform act of you should understand that the following important factors  in addition to those discussed elsewhere in this document and in the documents which we incorporate by reference  could affect the future results of mcclatchy  and could cause those future results to differ materially from those expressed in our forward looking statements general economic  market or business conditions  especially in any of the markets where we operate newspapers  geo political uncertainties including the risk of war  changes in newsprint prices and or printing and distribution costs from anticipated levels  changes in interest rates  changes in pension assets and liabilities  increased competition from newspapers or other forms of media in our principal markets  increased consolidation among major retailers in our newspaper markets or other events depressing the level of advertising  changes in our ability to negotiate and obtain favorable terms under collective bargaining arrangements with our employees  competitive actions by other companies  difficulties in servicing our debt obligations  other occurrences leading to decreased circulation and diminished revenues from both display and classified advertising  and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
additional information regarding certain risks newsprint is the major component of our cost of raw materials 
newsprint accounted for of mcclatchy s operating expenses in fiscal accordingly  our earnings are sensitive to changes in newsprint prices 
we have not attempted to hedge fluctuations in the normal purchases of newsprint or enter into contracts with embedded derivatives for the purchase of newsprint 
if the price of newsprint increases materially  our operating results could be adversely affected 
for a discussion of the impact of a change in newsprint prices on the company s earnings per share  please see the newsprint discussion above at recent events and trends 
if our newsprint suppliers experience labor unrest  transportation difficulties or other supply disruptions  our ability to produce and deliver newspapers could be impaired and or the cost of the newsprint could increase  both of which would negatively affect our operating results 
if mcclatchy experiences labor unrest  our ability to produce and deliver newspapers would be impaired 
the results of future labor negotiations could harm our operating results 
our newspapers have not endured a labor strike since however  we cannot ensure that a strike will not occur at one or more of our newspapers in the future 
as of december   
table of contents approximately a quarter of our full and part time employees were represented by unions including at the star tribune and at the sacramento bee  the company s two largest newspapers 
most of the company s union represented employees are currently working under labor agreements  which expire at various times 
mcclatchy faces collective bargaining upon the expirations of these labor agreements 
even if our newspapers do not suffer a labor strike  the company s operating results could be harmed if the results of labor negotiations restrict our ability to maximize the efficiency of its newspaper operations 
changes in the regulatory and technological environment are bringing about consolidation of media companies and convergence among various forms of media 
these changes are expected to continue or accelerate as a result of anticipated loosening of regulatory constraints by the federal communications commission 
the company faces competition with larger and more diversified entities for circulation and advertising revenues and further industry consolidation will likely increase this competition 
such consolidation could also affect the company s opportunities to make acquisitions 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in addition to normal business risks discussed above  the company utilizes interest rate protection agreements swaps to help maintain the overall interest rate risk parameters set by management 
none of these agreements was entered into for trading purposes 
the company has one interest rate swap agreement totaling million designated as a cash flow hedge specifically designed to hedge the variability in the expected cash flows that are attributable to interest rate fluctuations on million of its variable rate bank debt through june the effect of this agreement is to fix the london interbank offered rate libor interest rate exposure on these borrowings at approximately on that portion of the company s term loans 
all things being equal  a hypothetical basis point change in libor for a fiscal year would have a per share increase or decrease in the company s annual results of operations 
it would also impact the fair values of its market risk sensitive financial instrument but would not materially affect the company s financial position taken as a whole
