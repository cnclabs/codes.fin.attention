the restatement had no effect on reported total assets  net income  earnings applicable to common stock  cash flows from operations or liquidity 
overview middlesex water company has operated as a water utility in new jersey since  and in delaware  through our wholly owned subsidiary  tidewater  since we are in the business of collecting  treating  distributing and selling water for domestic  commercial  municipal  industrial and fire protection purposes 
we also operate a new jersey municipal water and wastewater system under contract and provide wastewater services in new jersey and delaware through our subsidiaries 
we are regulated as to rates charged to customers for water and wastewater services in new jersey and for water services in delaware  as to the quality of water service we provide and as to certain other matters 
only our usa  usa pa and white marsh subsidiaries are not regulated utilities 
our new jersey water utility system the middlesex system provides water services to approximately  retail customers  primarily in central new jersey 
the middlesex system also provides water service under contract to municipalities in central new jersey with a total population of approximately  in partnership with our subsidiary  usa pa  we operate the water supply system and wastewater system for the city of perth amboy  new jersey 
our other new jersey subsidiaries  pinelands water and pinelands wastewater  provide water and wastewater services to residents in southampton township  new jersey 
our delaware subsidiaries  tidewater and southern shores  provide water services to approximately  retail customers in new castle  kent and sussex counties  delaware 
our other delaware subsidiary  white marsh  services an additional  customers in kent and sussex counties 
the majority of our revenue is generated from retail and contract water services to customers in our service areas 
we record water service revenue as such service is rendered and include estimates for amounts unbilled at the end of the period for services provided after the last billing cycle 
fixed service charges are billed in advance by our subsidiary  tidewater  and are recognized in revenue as the service is provided 
our ability to increase operating income and net income is based significantly on three factors weather  adequate and timely rate increases  and customer growth 
these factors are evident in the discussions below which compare our results of operations from prior years 
cool  wet weather led to lower revenues and earnings in rate increases for middlesex and many of our subsidiaries increased revenues and net income in and customer growth in our delaware service territories has increased revenues greater than the cost to serve these new customers 
results of operations in compared to operating revenues for the year rose million or over the same period in customer growth of in delaware provided additional facility charges and connection fees of million 
higher base rates in our delaware service territories provided million of the increase 
though we anticipate continued growth in the number of customers and increased water consumption among our delaware systems  such growth and increased consumption cannot be guaranteed 
additionally  weather conditions may adversely impact future consumption despite anticipated growth in the number of customers 
for example  for the year ended december   cool wet weather in the mid atlantic region pushed tidewater s consumption revenue down by million and middlesex consumption revenue down by million 
despite such adverse weather conditions  revenues from our operations and maintenance contracts rose million due to scheduled increases in fixed fees under the city of perth amboy contract 
new wastewater operations in delaware provided million in additional revenues 
our new meter services venture provided million in additional revenues 
all other operations accounted for million of the higher revenues 
operating expenses increased by million or 
costs related to main breaks resulting from severe winter weather conditions in the first quarter of contributed to additional expenses of million 
there were also higher sewer disposal fees and security costs for usa pa that helped increase costs by million 
an increase in our delaware employee base  general wage increases and higher costs associated with employee medical and retirement benefits pushed up costs by million 
in new jersey  payroll costs  employee benefits and legal fees pushed up costs by million 
non regulated operations of meter installations and wastewater  which began in  contributed million of the overall expense increase 
water treatment  source of supply and pumping costs increased by million combined 
going forward we anticipate an increase in new jersey s electric generation costs due to deregulation of electricity and an increase of at least in the cost of untreated water purchased under a new contract with the new jersey water supply authority 
these increasing costs  in addition to higher business insurance and security costs prompted us to file for a base rate increase with the bpu for middlesex and a base rate increase for pinelands 
we cannot predict whether the bpu will approve  deny or reduce the amount of our requests  however  despite the outcome  we will continue to seek rate increases in the future where increased operating costs and capital investment necessitate such action 
depreciation expense for increased by million  or  due to a higher level of utility plant in service 
allowance for funds used during construction rose for the year as tidewater s capital program now includes larger projects with longer construction schedules 
as our investment in utility plant increases  we continue to seek timely rate relief either through base rate filings as discussed above or through other means such as the distribution system improvement charge dsic in delaware 
the dsic is a separate rate mechanism that allows for cost recovery of certain capital improvement costs incurred in between base rate filings 
delaware regulated water utilities are allowed to apply for a dsic every six months with the maximum increase limited to in any twelve month period and a overall limitation 
the psc approved an increase in tidewater s dsic to of base rates from  effective january  in addition  because tidewater continues to make significant capital additions and improvements to its new and existing systems  it believes it will be necessary to file for a base rate increase by early spring that increase request  which is expected to be in excess of  is due to the million of additional utility plant placed in service or to be placed in service since the last rate case 
other taxes increased by million generally due to higher payroll related taxes and real estate taxes in both new jersey and delaware 
lower federal income taxes of million over last year are attributable to the reduced operating results for as compared to other income decreased by million as interest rates fell on short term cash balance investments 
interest expense increased by million due to a higher level of overall debt outstanding as compared to last year 
net income decreased to million from million and basic and diluted earnings per share decreased by to due to lower earnings 
results of operations in compared to operating revenues increased million or over the prior year 
higher base rates in new jersey and delaware provided million of the increase 
a full year of ownership of the bayview and southern shores systems generated additional revenue of million 
service fees from our operation and maintenance contracts rose million due to an increase in fixed fees for sewer disposal under the city of perth amboy contract 
consumption revenues decreased by million 
drought restrictions in new jersey caused decreased usage in the amount of million 
the continued double digit growth of our tidewater customer base offset million of the lower consumption revenues 
operating expenses increased million for the year 
operation and maintenance expenses accounted for million of the increase 
there were higher sewer costs of million for usa pa 
general wage increases  higher costs associated with employee medical and retirement benefits and an increase in our delaware employee base  pushed up operation and maintenance costs by million 
approximately million was due to the inclusion of expenses of southern shores for the entire year 
increases in business insurances  audit fees and stock exchange filing fees amounted to million 
a favorable decrease in water production and treatment costs of million was due to drought related consumption decreases in our new jersey operations 
other taxes increased by million due to higher revenue related taxes in new jersey  increased real estate taxes and payroll taxes in both new jersey and delaware 
higher federal income taxes of million over were attributable to favorable operating results over that year 
depreciation expense decreased by million  or  due to the full recovery of our investment in transportation equipment  which we depreciate at a higher rate than our mains and appurtenances 
allowance for funds used during construction rose million for the year as the capital programs of middlesex water company and tidewater now include larger projects with longer construction periods 
other income was lower by million due mostly to the recognition of a one time gain reported in by a small investor owned water utility in southern delaware  in which we own a interest 
even though there was a higher level of long term and short term debt outstanding compared to  lower interest rates on short term debt and the million refinancing of long term debt at a lower rate helped to keep the interest expense increase to or million 
net income rose to million from million and basic and diluted earnings per share rose from to per share due to higher earnings 
outlook our revenues should continue to increase in as we expect customer growth in delaware and our pursuit of non regulated opportunities in delaware and elsewhere to continue 
the level of revenues and earnings will be impacted by the ultimate outcome of the new jersey base rate cases currently under review by the bpu and the anticipated base rate filing in delaware for tidewater 
revenues and earnings will also be influenced by weather 
changes in these factors as well as our projected capital program are the primary factors that will determine the need for future rate increase filings 
we continue to explore viable plans to streamline operations and reduce costs  particularly in delaware  where customer growth continues to exceed industry averages 
part of the challenge is that our delaware operations are a combination of over stand alone production and distribution systems serving communities 
our strategy is for continued growth through acquisitions  internal expansion  public private partnerships and rate relief 
we will continue to pursue opportunities in both the regulated and non regulated sectors that are financially sound  complement existing operations and increase shareholder value 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows from operations are largely based on three factors weather  adequate and timely rate increases  and customer growth 
the effect of those factors on net income is discussed in results of operations 
for  net cash flow from operations of million  which increased over due to lower working capital requirements  and proceeds from prior year financings allowed us to fund approximately of our utility plant expenditures 
net proceeds from issuing long term debt were used to fund the balance of those expenditures 
as shown in the following table  we expect our capital expenditures in and to increase over these increases are attributable to a major pipeline installation in the middlesex system and continued customer growth and service improvement requirements in our tidewater systems in delaware  where we spent million on utility plant in millions of dollars delaware systems raw water line renew program scheduled upgrades to existing systems total under our capital program for  we plan to expend million for water system additions and improvements for our delaware systems  which include the construction of two elevated tanks  a sludge removal plant and the creation of several new wells and interconnections 
the two year  million project to construct the second raw water line to middlesex primary water treatment plant is expected to begin in we expect to spend million for the renew program  which is our program to clean and cement line unlined mains in the middlesex system 
there remains a total of approximately miles of unlined mains in the mile middlesex system 
in  miles of unlined mains were cleaned and cement lined 
the capital program also includes million for scheduled upgrades to our existing systems in new jersey 
the scheduled upgrades consist of million for mains  million for service lines  million for meters  million for hydrants  million for computer systems and million for various other items 
to pay for our capital program in  we will utilize internally generated funds and funds available under existing new jersey environmental infrastructure trust loans currently  million and delaware state revolving fund loans currently  million  which provide low cost financing for projects that meet certain water quality and system improvement benchmarks 
if necessary  we will also utilize short term borrowings through million of available lines of credit with three commercial banks 
as of december   we had million outstanding against the lines of credit 
we have filed with the united states securities and exchange commission sec a registration statement on form s covering the offering of  shares of our common stock 
we anticipate the registration statement will be declared effective in march  after the filing with the sec of this annual report on form k for the year ended december  there can be no assurance that the registration statement will be declared effective in march or at any later time 
if the offering is completed  we expect to use the net proceeds to repay our outstanding short term borrowings 
going forward into through  we currently project that we will be required to expend approximately million for capital projects 
plans to finance those projects are underway as we expect to receive approval to borrow up to million under the new jersey environmental infrastructure trust program in november of we anticipate that some of the capital projects in delaware will be eligible for the delaware state revolving fund program in that state and we are pursuing those opportunities 
we also expect to use internally generated funds and proceeds from the sale of common stock through the dividend reinvestment and common stock purchase plan 
increases in certain operating costs will impact our liquidity and capital resources 
as described in our results of operations discussion  we have filed for rate relief for middlesex and the pinelands companies 
there is no certainty  however  that the bpu will approve any or all of the requested increase 
we also plan to file for a base rate increase for tidewater by early spring 
contractual obligations the table below presents our known contractual obligations for the periods specified 
the purchased water amounts include the effect of the new agreement with the new jersey water supply authority effective january  payment due by period millions of dollars less than more than total year years years years long term debt purchased water contracts wastewater operations total guarantees usa pa operates the city of perth amboy s perth amboy water and wastewater systems under a service contract agreement through june  the agreement was effected under new jersey s water supply public private contracting act and the new jersey wastewater public private contracting act 
under the agreement  usa pa receives a fixed fee and a variable fee based on increased system billing 
scheduled fixed fee payments began at million in the first year and will increase over the term of the contract to million 
in connection with the agreement  perth amboy  through the middlesex county improvement authority  issued approximately million in three series of bonds 
middlesex guaranteed one of those series of bonds  which are designated the series c serial bonds  in the principal amount of approximately million 
perth amboy guaranteed the two other series of bonds 
the series c serial bonds have various maturity dates with the final maturity date on september  as of december   approximately million of the series c serial bonds remained outstanding 
we are obligated to perform under the guarantee in the event notice is received from the series c serial bonds trustee of an impending debt service deficiency 
if middlesex funds any debt service obligations as guarantor  there is a provision in the agreement that requires perth amboy to reimburse us 
there are other provisions in the agreement that we believe make it unlikely that we will be required to perform under the guarantee  such as scheduled annual rate increases for the water and wastewater services as well as rate increases due to unforeseen circumstances 
in the event revenues from customers could not satisfy the reimbursement requirements  perth amboy has ad valorem taxing powers  which could be used to raise the needed amount 
critical accounting policies and estimates the application of accounting policies and standards often requires the use of estimates  assumptions and judgments 
changes in these variables may lead to significantly different financial statement results 
our critical accounting policies are set forth below 
regulatory accounting we maintain our books and records in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
middlesex and certain of its subsidiaries  which account for of operating revenues and of total assets  are subject to regulation in the state in which they operate 
those companies are required to maintain their accounts in accordance with regulatory authorities rules and guidelines  which may differ from other authoritative accounting pronouncements 
in those instances  the company follows the guidance provided in the financial accounting standards board fasb  statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we defer costs and obligations if it is probable that these items will be recognized for rate making purposes in future rates 
accordingly  we have recorded costs and obligations  which will be amortized over various future periods 
any change in the assessment of the probability of rate making treatment will require us to change the accounting treatment of the deferred item 
we do not believe any of the deferred items we have recorded will be treated differently by the regulators in the future 
revenues revenues from metered customers include amounts billed on a cycle basis and unbilled amounts estimated from the last meter reading date to the end of the accounting period 
the estimated unbilled amounts are determined by utilizing factors which include historical consumption usage and current climate conditions 
differences between estimated revenues and actual billings are recorded in a subsequent period 
revenues from unmetered customers are billed at a fixed tariff rate in advance at the beginning of each service period and are recognized in revenue ratably over the service period 
revenues from the city of perth amboy management contract are comprised of fixed and variable fees 
fixed fees  which have been set for the life of the contract  are billed monthly and recorded as earned 
variable fees  which are based on billings and other factors and are not significant  are recorded upon approval of the amount by the city 
pension plan we maintain a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan which covers substantially all employees with more than  hours of service 
the discount rate utilized for determining future pension obligations has decreased from at december  to at december  to at december  lowering the discount rate by would have increased the net periodic pension cost by million in lowering the expected long term rate of return on the pension plans by from to would have increased the net periodic pension cost in by approximately million 
future actual pension income will depend on future investment performance  changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the population participating in the pension plans

the company collects the estimated removal costs of utility plant in rates through depreciation in accordance with regulatory treatment 
at december   the company reclassified the estimated removal costs of million from accumulated depreciation to a regulatory liability 
at december   million was reclassified from accumulated depreciation to removal costs for utility plant retirement obligations 
this reclassification had no impact on the company s results of operations 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk the company is subject to the risk of fluctuating interest rates in the normal course of business 
our policy is to manage interest rates through the use of fixed rate long term debt and  to a lesser extent  short term debt 
the company s interest rate risk related to existing fixed rate  long term debt is not material due to the term of the majority of our first mortgage bonds  which have final maturity dates ranging from to over the next twelve months  approximately million of the current portion of ten existing long term debt instruments will mature 
combining this amount with the million in short term debt outstanding at december   and applying a hypothetical change in the rate of interest charged by on those borrowings  would not have a material effect on our earnings
