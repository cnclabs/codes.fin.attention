item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview corning had three significant priorities in to protect our financial health  to restore profitability  and to invest in our future 
we have made significant progress towards all three in financial health we have improved our balance sheet in by substantially decreasing our debt from billion at the beginning of the year to billion 
we reduced debt by using cash on hand and by completing equity offerings of million shares of our common stock for proceeds of million in the third quarter and million shares of our common stock for proceeds of million in the second quarter 
these actions improved our debt to capital ratio from at the end of to at the end of we have billion in cash and cash equivalents and short term investments  access to a billion revolving credit facility and access to the capital markets 
our major source of funding for and beyond will be our existing balance of cash and short term investments 
from time to time  we may also issue debt or equity securities to raise additional cash to fund a portion of our capital expenditures related to our growth businesses 
we believe we have sufficient liquidity for the next several years to fund operations  restructuring liabilities  the asbestos settlement  research and development expenditures  capital expenditures and scheduled debt repayments 
profitability on an overall basis  we believe that our results reflect positive developments including significant growth in our display technologies business  stabilization in our telecommunications segment  and exiting our photonics and conventional video components product lines 
we incurred a net loss of million  or per share in compared to a net loss of billion  or per share  in  and a net loss of billion  or per share  in the improvements were driven primarily by a reduction in restructuring  impairment and other charges and credits to million million after tax and minority interest in compared to billion billion after tax in and billion billion after tax in our million net loss in included the following 
a charge of million million after tax related to the pending asbestos settlement of current and future tort claims in connection with a proposed reorganization plan for our pcc equity affiliate  
a net gain on repurchases of debt of million million after tax  and 
an after tax charge in equity earnings of million related to an asset impairment charge recorded by samsung corning  a owned equity venture which manufactures glass funnels and panels for conventional television 
sales in the telecommunications segment have stabilized  remaining relatively flat from the third quarter of to the fourth quarter we have been able to reduce the loss in the telecommunications segment in by closing plants and reducing costs 
demand for many of our products  particularly in photonics  remained soft 
in july  we completed the sale of certain photonics assets to avanex  and in december  our final shipment of pump lasers for sale to avanex was completed 
sales and earnings in our technologies segment improved primarily due to the results of our display technologies business 
sales of this business grew from million in the first quarter of to million in the fourth quarter of offsetting the improvement in the display technologies business  the market for conventional televisions declined 
as a result  we agreed with our partner to shutdown cav  a consolidated venture that manufactured conventional video components products 
in addition  demand for high purity fused silica and calcium fluoride products was lower than we had anticipated 
therefore  we decided to consolidate the operations of our semiconductor materials products in the fourth quarter of to make our infrastructure more flexible for the cyclical nature of this market 
investing in our future we remain committed to investing in innovation  and we are investing in a wide variety of technologies including liquid crystal displays  diesel filters and substrates  and the optical fiber  cable  and hardware and equipment that will enable fiber to the premises 
although our spending in research  development and engineering has declined  as a percentage of sales it remains above historic levels 
we have also continued to invest in capital spending in the technologies segment 
capital spending in and approximated million and million  respectively  the majority of which was to expand capacity for liquid crystal display glass and for new capacity for diesel substrates and filters 
as a result of market expansion  in we expect our consolidated capital spending to approximate million to million  of which million to million will be to expand capacity for liquid crystal display glass production

consolidated net sales for were billion  a decrease of  or billion  from sales of billion 
the sales decline was most pronounced in the telecommunications segment where significantly lower demand and price declines for our optical fiber and cable and photonic technologies products caused sales to decrease in this segment by  or billion year to year 
sales in the technologies segment for decreased  or million  compared to gross margin as a percentage of net sales  gross margin improved eight points in compared to the improvement was driven by lower depreciation and other fixed costs resulting from the restructuring actions  primarily in the telecommunications segment 
gross margin improved in both segments  however  the gains achieved in the technologies segment were partially offset by a million write down of inventory related to the exit of cav 
as a percentage of net sales  gross margin decreased from to in compared to gross margin was impacted by lower sales volumes in the telecommunications segment which were insufficient to cover fixed manufacturing costs 
downward pricing pressure also negatively impacted gross margins  primarily in the optical fiber and cable products 
these negative trends were offset by significant fixed cost reductions as manufacturing capacity was shutdown 
gross margin in the technologies segment decreased approximately two points from selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative sg a expenses decreased  or million  in compared to and as a percentage of sales improved four points in the same period

restructuring  impairment and other charges and credits corning recorded significant net charges in  and these charges are summarized in the following table in millions for the years ended december  impairment of goodwill  restructuring actions  impairment of long lived assets other than goodwill photonic technologies conventional video components total restructuring  impairment and other charges   impairment of goodwill annual assessment due to market conditions in the telecommunications and semiconductor industries  we performed goodwill impairment tests for our telecommunications and specialty materials reporting units in the fourth quarter of the results of our impairment tests indicated that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its book value 
although an impairment charge was not required in  it is possible that future impairment charges may be required if our expected future cash flow estimates are not realized 
management must exercise judgment in assessing the recoverability of goodwill 
see critical accounting estimates for related discussion 
we believe the telecommunication industry is currently depressed but will ultimately recover 
we do not expect growth in this segment in the short term  but believe that growth will return to this segment by our view that the industry will recover is based on the fact that bandwidth demand continues to grow  and the belief that a combination of public policy changes  consolidation and recovery of industry players  and the advancement of profitable broadband business models will drive recovery in the future 
we believe the specialty materials reporting unit decrease in sales in was primarily due to the cyclical nature of the semiconductor market 
we expect increased volume growth beginning in charge in the fourth quarter of  we conducted our annual impairment tests and concluded that an impairment charge of million million after tax was necessary to reduce the carrying value of goodwill in the telecommunications reporting unit to its estimated fair value of billion 
the decrease in fair value at the end of from that measured in the initial benchmark assessment on january  primarily reflected the following 
a delay in the timing of the expected recovery from late  or early to  
a reduction in the short term cash flow expectations of the fiber and cable business and a lower base from which the expected recovery will occur  and 
a reduction in the short and long term cash flow expectations of the photonic technologies product line 
we retained valuation specialists to assist in the valuation of our tangible and identifiable intangible assets for the purpose of determining the implied fair value of goodwill at december  charge during the first half of  we experienced a significant decrease in the rate of growth of our telecommunications segment  primarily in the photonics technologies product line due to a dramatic decline in infrastructure spending in the telecommunications industry  and determined that there were events of impairment within photonics 
we determined that our goodwill related to photonics was not recoverable under sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  which was the governing accounting principles generally accepted in the us gaap guidance at that time 
as a result  we recorded a charge of billion to impair a significant portion of goodwill  of which billion related to the pirelli transaction and billion related to goodwill resulting from the acquisition of netoptix corporation 
restructuring actions restructuring actions corning recorded net charges of million million credit after tax and minority interest in major actions approved and initiated in included the following 
the shutdown of cav  which was a manufacturer of glass panel and funnels for use in conventional tube televisions within the technologies segment  
the sale and exit of our photonics products within the telecommunications segment  and 
the shutdown of two of our specialty materials manufacturing facilities  which are within the technologies segment 
restructuring charges the restructuring charges of million included million of employee separation costs including special termination and curtailment losses related to pension and postretirement health care plans and million in other exit costs principally lease termination and contract cancellation payments  offset by an million credit related to previous restructuring actions 
these credits were primarily the result of revised cost estimates of existing restructuring plans and a decision to not exit two small cabling sites 
the charge entailed the elimination of approximately  hourly and salaried positions including involuntary separation  early retirement and social programs 
in addition  we recorded a million foreign deferred tax benefit adjustment related to restructuring charges recorded in this credit is reflected in the consolidated statement of operations under  benefit for income taxes 
impairment of plant and equipment to be shutdown or disposed corning recorded a net credit of million in this included million of charges to impair plant and equipment related to facilities to be shutdown or disposed  which comprised million for the north brookfield semiconductor materials plant closure  million related to a cabling plant  million related to the final exit of photonics  and million of other various costs 
the impairment charges were determined based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeded the fair market value of the asset 
the charge was more than offset by million in credits related to previous restructuring actions 
these credits were primarily the result of our decision not to exit two of the previous cabling sites marked for shutdown in as well as proceeds on asset disposals exceeding assumed salvage values 
impairment of cost investments in the first quarter  we recorded a million charge for other than temporary declines in certain cost investments in the telecommunications segment 
in the third quarter  we sold these investments for million in cash  which was million more than previously expected 
we reported this gain as a credit to restructuring actions 
loss on sale of photonics we recorded a loss of million in the third quarter when we completed the sale of certain photonic technologies assets to avanex 
in exchange for our photonics assets and million in cash  we received million restricted shares of avanex common stock  which we valued at approximately million 
these shares are restricted from sale for approximately one year at which point the restrictions are lifted at intervals beginning july and ending october as the shares become unrestricted  we will mark to market the shares through other comprehensive income as available for sale securities 
the avanex restricted shares are reflected as a cost investment and recorded under investments in our consolidated balance sheet 
approximately employees of the photonic technologies products became employees of avanex in the third quarter 
the loss on sale included a million reduction of our goodwill 
see notes restructuring actions and investments of the consolidated financial statements for further detail 
in addition to these restructuring action costs  we also incurred the following charges in our consolidated statement of operations related to the exit of photonics 
an increase to the deferred tax valuation allowance by million as we do not expect to realize certain deferred tax assets in italy  which is reflected in the consolidated statement of operations under  benefit for income taxes  and 
a million impairment charge for equity investments that were abandoned as part of the exit from photonics  which is reflected in the consolidated statement of operations under  equity in earnings of associated companies  net of impairments 
accelerated depreciation we recorded million of accelerated depreciation as a result of our decision to shutdown our semiconductor materials manufacturing facility in charleston  south carolina by march  we will record an additional million in the first quarter of while the plant continues operating

we recorded total charges of billion million after tax and minority interest over the second  third and fourth quarters 
actions approved and initiated in included the following 
permanent closing of our optical fiber manufacturing facilities in noble park  victoria  australia  and neustadt bei coburg  germany 
we also mothballed our optical fiber manufacturing facility in concord  north carolina and transferred certain capabilities to our wilmington  north carolina facility  
reductions in capacity and employment in our cabling and hardware and equipment locations worldwide to reduce costs  
permanent closure of our photonic technologies thin film filter manufacturing facility in marlborough  massachusetts  
permanent abandonment of certain construction projects that had been stopped in in the fiber and cable business within the telecommunications segment  
closure of minor manufacturing facilities  primarily in the telecommunications segment  
closure and consolidation of research facilities  
elimination of positions worldwide through voluntary and involuntary programs  and 
divestiture of a portion of the controls and connectors product line in the telecommunications segment

restructuring actions in july and october of  we announced a series of restructuring actions in response to significant deteriorating business conditions which began initially in our telecommunications segment  but eventually spread to our other businesses as the year progressed 
the following actions were approved and undertaken in 
closure of seven major manufacturing facilities and the consolidation of several smaller facilities in the telecommunications and technologies segments  
discontinuation of our initiative in corning microarray technology products  part of our life sciences products  and 
elimination of approximately  positions affecting all operating segments  but especially impacting the photonic technologies  hardware and equipment and the optical fiber and cable products 
this action included a selective voluntary early retirement program for certain employees along with involuntary separations 
these actions resulted in a pre tax charge totaling million million after tax for the year ended december  approximately one third of the total charge was expected to be paid in cash

impairment of long lived assets other than goodwill given our restructuring actions and the market conditions facing our businesses  at various times throughout to  we performed evaluations of the recoverability of our long lived assets 
in each case that an impairment evaluation was required  we developed operating cash flow projections for each strategic alternative and made assessments as to the probability of each outcome 
if our projections indicated that our long lived assets were not recoverable through future cash flows  we were then required to estimate the fair value of the long lived assets  which were limited to property  plant and equipment  using the expected cash flow approach as a measure of fair value 
impairment charge in april  we announced that we had agreed with our partner to shutdown cav and wrote down its assets to their estimated salvage values 
this resulted in an impairment charge of million million after tax and minority interest 
subsequent to our decision to exit  cav signed a definitive agreement to sell tangible assets to henan anyang cpt glass bulb group  electronic glass co  ltd 
henan anyang  located in china  for amounts exceeding estimated salvage values 
upon the receipt of million in cash  we recognized a million credit in restructuring 
we expect the sale to be completed in the first half of at which time we anticipate recognizing an additional gain of approximately million million after tax and minority interest 
impairment charges photonic technologies in  the telecommunications market underwent a dramatic decline in demand for its products as major buyers of network equipment in this industry reduced their capital spending 
this negative trend was expected to continue into the foreseeable future 
as a result of our impairment evaluation  the photonics assets were written down to estimated salvage value  as this amount was our best estimate of fair value 
this resulted in a million million after tax write down of the long lived assets including million related to patents 
conventional video components in  the market was impacted by a decline in demand for conventional television glass and a dramatic increase in the importation of television glass  tubes and sets from asia 
these trends were expected to continue into the foreseeable future 
as a result of our impairment evaluation  cav s assets were written down to their estimated fair values 
this resulted in a million million after tax and minority interest write down of the assets 
impairment charges photonic technologies in  the telecommunications market s dramatic decline began 
we performed an asset impairment evaluation of our photonics product line and incurred a charge of million to write down intangible assets to their estimated fair values 
asbestos settlement on march   we announced that we had reached agreement with the representatives of asbestos claimants for the settlement of all current and future non premises asbestos claims against us and pcc  which might arise from pcc products or operations 
the agreement is expected to be incorporated into a settlement fund as part of a reorganization plan for pcc 
the plan will be submitted to the federal bankruptcy court in pittsburgh for approval  and is subject to a number of contingencies  including a favorable vote by of the asbestos claimants voting on the pcc reorganization plan 
we will make our contributions to the settlement trust under the agreement after the plan is approved  becomes effective and is no longer subject to appeal 
we expect the approval process to be complete in when the plan becomes effective  our settlement will require the contribution of our equity interest in pcc  our one half equity interest in pce  and million shares of our common stock 
the common stock will be marked to market each quarter until it is contributed to the settlement trust  thus resulting in adjustments to income and the settlement liability as appropriate 
we will also make cash payments with a current value of million over six years beginning in june which we will accelerate  as needed  to maximize the related tax benefits 
in addition  we will assign insurance policy proceeds from our primary insurance and a portion of our excess insurance as part of the settlement 
we recorded an initial charge of million in the first quarter of to reflect the terms of the settlement and additional charges of million to reflect the mark to market of our common stock through december  total charges of million million after tax were incurred for the twelve months ended december  this charge was previously reported as a nonoperating charge in our quarterly reports on form q 
effective with this annual report on form k  we have reclassified this charge to operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 
the carrying value of our investment in pce and the fair value of million shares of our common stock  totaling million  have been reflected in current liabilities 
the remaining million  representing the net present value of the cash payments  discounted at  is recorded in noncurrent liabilities 
see legal proceedings for a history of this matter 
operating loss we incurred an operating loss of million in which was significantly lower than the loss of billion and the operating loss of billion 
our loss in included the asbestos settlement charges 
losses in all three years included restructuring  impairment and other charges and credits as described above 
our results for were also impacted by an operating charge of million to write down excess and obsolete inventory  a million charge related to the release of restrictions on shares of corning common stock and a million charge to write down an investment in intellectual property 
gain on repurchases and retirement of debt  net during the years ended december  and  we repurchased and retired a significant portion of our zero coupon convertible debentures due november  in  we repurchased and retired  debentures with an accreted value of billion for cash of approximately billion through open market purchases and a public tender offer and recorded a net gain of million 
we also issued million shares of common stock from treasury in exchange for  debentures with an accreted value of million  and recognized a charge of million reflecting the fair value of the incremental shares issued beyond those required by the terms of the debentures 
the increase in equity due to the issuance of shares from treasury stock was million 
the following table summarizes the activity related to our zero coupon convertible debentures dollars in millions for the years ended december  bonds repurchased or exchanged for equity   book value  fair value  pre tax gain after tax gain net of the write off of unamortized issuance and deal costs 
in addition to our zero coupon debentures  we repurchased and retired  euro notes due with a book value of million euros for cash of million euros including accrued interest or million 
we recorded a loss of million on the transaction 
benefit for income taxes our provision benefit for income taxes and the related effective benefit rates for continuing operations were as follows in millions for the years ended december  provision benefit for income taxes effective benefit rate our effective tax rate was impacted by our restructuring  impairment and other charges and credits and our gains on repurchases and retirements of debt 
excluding these items  our rate was in  in and in sfas no  accounting for income taxes sfas no 
 requires that a valuation allowance be established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
a review of all available positive and negative evidence needs to be considered  including a company s current  past and future predicted performance  the market environment of the industries in which the company operates  the utilization of past tax credits  length of carryback and carryforward periods  and existing contracts or sales backlog that will result in future profits 
at december   we have recorded gross deferred tax assets of approximately billion with a valuation allowance of million  and offset by deferred tax liabilities of million 
the valuation allowance is primarily attributable to the uncertainty regarding the realization of specific foreign and state tax benefits  net operating losses and tax credits 
the net deferred tax assets of approximately billion consist of a combination of domestic us federal  state and local and foreign tax benefits for a items which have been recognized for financial reporting purposes  but which will be reported on tax returns to be filed in the future  and b loss and tax credit carryforwards 
as explained further below  we have performed the required assessment of positive and negative evidence regarding the realization of the net deferred tax assets in accordance with sfas no 
this assessment included the evaluation of scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  estimates of projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies 
although realization is not assured  based on our assessment  we have concluded that it is more likely than not that such assets  net of the existing valuation allowance  will be realized 
net domestic deferred tax assets are approximately billion at december  approximately million of these net deferred tax assets relate to loss and tax credit carryforwards that expire through the remaining net deferred tax assets comprise the following deductible temporary differences other postretirement benefits of million  which will reverse over the next to years  restructuring and other liabilities of million  which will reverse over the next years  research and development expenditures of million  which will reverse over the next years  and other miscellaneous items of million  which will reverse  on average  over the next years 
approximately of our net domestic deferred tax assets will be realized through net operating loss carryback claims to be filed over the next three to five years  which will generate cash refunds during such period 
we expect the remaining net domestic deferred tax assets to be realized from future earnings 
however  in the event future earnings are insufficient  approximately of our net domestic deferred tax assets could be realized through a tax planning strategy involving the sale of a non strategic appreciated asset 
realization of the remaining of our net domestic deferred tax assets is solely dependent on our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income during carryforward periods of approximately years 
the minimum amount of domestic future income that would have to be generated to realize this portion of our deferred tax assets is billion over at least years 
currently  we are generating domestic losses 
however  our forecast of domestic income indicates it is more likely than not that the future results of operations in the us will generate sufficient taxable income to realize this portion of our deferred tax assets 
specifically  we expect to incur significantly lower domestic losses in and to return to profitability in the us in key assumptions embedded in these near term forecasts follow our us losses will decrease as a result of the exit of the photonics technologies business and cav 
we expect to see improved earnings trends in our telecommunications segment which is primarily in the us this includes a lower loss in and a return to profitability in this trend is partially being driven by the realization of lower operating costs as a result of prior years restructuring actions 
in addition  we are forecasting revenue to be flat or down slightly in but significantly higher in due to an expected recovery in the telecommunications industry in our specialty materials semiconductor business will generate higher earnings in as a result of a recovery in the semiconductor equipment industry and lower operating costs as a result of the fourth quarter restructuring actions  which will be completed by the end of the first quarter of our display business will continue its rapid growth 
although this business is largely based in asia  domestic earnings of this business have increased in and are expected to continue to increase over the next several years  in part due to an increase in us royalty income 
we will continue to sustain modest growth in our remaining domestic businesses and  except for the restructuring actions announced prior to december   we do not expect to incur any significant additional restructuring or impairment charges 
our forecast of domestic income is based on assumptions about and current trends in our operating segments  and there can be no assurance that such results will be achieved 
we review such forecasts in comparison with actual results and expected trends quarterly for purpose of our recoverability assessment 
as a result of this review  if we determine that we will not return to profitability in the us in or if sufficient future taxable income may not be generated to fully realize the net deferred tax assets  we will increase the valuation allowance by a charge to income tax expense in an amount equal to the portion of the deferred tax assets that are realizable solely through projected future taxable income 
if we record such a valuation allowance  we will also cease to recognize additional tax benefits on any losses in the us equity in earnings of associated companies  net of impairments equity earnings nearly doubled to million in the increase was due to the following 
the resumption of the recognition of equity earnings from dow corning in added million to equity earnings in in  we fully impaired our investment in dow corning upon its entry into bankruptcy proceedings and did not recognize equity earnings from the second quarter of through the end of we began recognizing equity earnings in the first quarter of when we concluded that dow corning s emergence from bankruptcy protection was probable based on the bankruptcy court s findings on december  see legal proceedings for a history of this matter 

our owned samsung corning precision  a south korean manufacturer of liquid crystal display glass  increased its net income by compared to  resulting in equity earnings million higher than earnings in were million 

these positive results were negatively impacted by samsung corning  which recorded a significant asset impairment charge in the fourth quarter of our portion of that charge was million after tax  which resulted in a net equity loss of million 
equity earnings in were million  a decline of from  primarily due to the impairment of an equity investment in the second quarter of for million and a million reduction in equity earnings in the fourth quarter  caused by restructuring and impairment charges recorded by samsung corning micro optics  a owned manufacturer of photonics components

restructuring and impairment charges included a million loss on the sale of photonics technologies assets to avanex and million for restructuring charges offset by credits of million  resulting in net credits of million 
all of the telecommunications products reported a loss in  however  the losses were significantly lower than those incurred in the prior year 
the decrease in the loss over the prior year was primarily due to much lower restructuring and impairment charges and cost savings resulting from these actions 
the following discussion of products in the telecommunications segment excludes the restructuring and impairment charges and credits to provide clarity on the underlying business trends 
optical fiber and cable sales declined  or million compared to the decrease was primarily due to pricing pressure  particularly in fiber  but was partially offset by strong demand in japan and china  primarily in the first quarter 
sales volume increased almost in compared to due primarily to having the full year results of the chinese fiber and cable entities acquired from lucent in the fourth quarter of volumes for our other fiber and cable facilities were up slightly in compared to the loss for was significantly less than due to significant cost reduction 
hardware and equipment sales were relatively flat compared to  decreasing  or million 
the sales decrease was primarily due to the overall lack of capital spending by our customers impacting the entire telecommunications industry 
the loss for significantly decreased from the prior year due to cost reductions achieved from the restructuring actions and other cost reduction initiatives 
photonic technologies on july   we completed the sale of a significant portion of the photonic technologies assets to avanex 
see restructuring  impairment and other charges and credits and note restructuring actions to the consolidated financial statements 
sales declined  or million  compared to due to lower sales volume in the early part of the year as well as our exit of photonics technologies in the loss in was more than less than the prior year loss due to cost savings resulting from restructuring actions taken in as well as the exit of this business in controls and connectors sales decreased  or million in  compared to the prior year 
the sales decline for the year was primarily due to the sale of the appliance controls group in may and the lack of capital spending in the telecommunications industry 
the controls and connectors product line incurred a small loss in  however  the loss decreased significantly  compared to the prior year  primarily due to cost savings from restructuring actions taken in vs 
this segment incurred significant restructuring and impairment charges in and the and charges are described in detail in restructuring  impairment and other charges and credits 
the restructuring activities were undertaken to reduce the operating cost structure due to continued market declines 
more than half of the charge related to the impairment of fixed assets  primarily in the fiber and cable business 
a significant portion of the asset impairments in this business represented the closure of two fiber plants and permanent abandonment of certain construction projects 
the balance of the charge represented impairments of cost based investments  primarily in the photonic technologies business  and severance and benefits for retirees and separated personnel in all businesses 
in addition  the segment incurred a million charge for the impairment of goodwill and a million charge for long lived asset impairments in photonic technologies 
the impairment charge incurred in the second quarter of relates to goodwill and certain acquired intangible assets from acquisitions in the photonic technologies business 
these charges are described in notes impairment of goodwill and impairment of other long lived assets to the consolidated financial statements 
sales in the segment declined  or  million  compared to as each product in the segment experienced a significant decline in volume with the largest declines in optical fiber and cable and photonic technologies 
the segment incurred losses of billion in  compared to a net loss of billion in the loss was primarily due to the significant decrease in sales volume and restructuring and impairment charges 
each product line reported a loss in the trend between years reflected lower restructuring and impairment charges 
excluding these restructuring and impairment charges  the segment net loss was million compared to a loss of million in the increase in the loss in reflected reduced sales volumes and lower prices in each product line offset by cost reductions resulting from restructuring actions 
the following discussion of products in the telecommunications segment excludes the restructuring and impairment charges and credits to provide clarity on the underlying business trends 
optical fiber and cable sales declined  or  million compared to the decrease was primarily due to a sales volume decline of more than for the year as well as double digit price declines 
excluding restructuring and impairment charges  the optical fiber and cable product line incurred a significant loss in  compared to profits in the prior year  primarily due to significantly lower sales volume  declining prices and unfavorable product mix 
as discussed in restructuring actions  the optical fiber and cable product line undertook significant restructuring actions in the fourth quarter of these actions included permanent closure of two international fiber manufacturing plants and the mothballing of the concord  north carolina facility 
we believe that the concord facility can be returned to productive capacity within six to nine months of a decision to do so and construction in progress at the concord facility can be completed efficiently 
we believe the concord and wilmington plants will provide sufficient capacity for the foreseeable future 
hardware and equipment sales decreased  or million  compared to the sales decreases were primarily due to the overall lack of spending impacting the entire telecommunications industry 
excluding restructuring charges  the product line incurred a loss driven by lower volumes and pricing pressure in  compared to a near breakeven performance in photonic technologies sales declined  or million  compared to  primarily due to lower sales volume as network buildouts in the telecommunications industry declined resulting in much lower demand for photonic products 
the business incurred a significant loss for primarily due to dramatically lower sales volumes 
however  the losses decreased more than  compared to the losses incurred in  which included inventory writedowns of million 
the results in reflected cost reductions resulting from restructuring actions taken in and during the second quarter of  we favorably resolved an open issue from the second quarter of with a major customer  resulting in the recognition of revenue of million and pre tax income of million 
this revenue was recognized in part on shipment of inventory previously reserved 
in addition  we settled an open matter with a significant vendor in resulting in the reversal of a vendor reserve of million that was recorded as part of the charge in the second quarter of controls and connectors sales decreased  or million  compared to  due to the sale of the appliance controls group in may and reduced capital spending in the telecommunications industry 
due to lower sales volumes  a loss was incurred for the year compared to earnings in outlook the global telecommunications market downturn that began in continued into  however  we believe that conditions have begun to stabilize 
we ultimately expect a recovery in  and we believe will be comparable to we expect sales to be flat to down slightly compared to although we expect to see volumes in our hardware and equipment and fiber and cable businesses to increase  we will continue to experience pricing pressure  but at a lower level than in we expect a loss in  however  we believe it will be significantly less than  primarily due to the exit of the photonic technologies product line and lower operating expenses reflecting cost savings from restructuring actions taken in and technologies the technologies segment manufactures specialized products with unique properties for customer applications utilizing glass  glass ceramic and polymer technologies 
its primary products include liquid crystal display glass for flat panel displays  ceramic substrates for automobile and diesel applications  scientific laboratory products  high purity fused silica and other advanced materials used for the manufacture of integrated circuits and glass panels and funnels for televisions and cathode ray tubes 
in april  we announced that we had reached agreement with our partner to shutdown cav

sales in the technologies segment increased  or million  compared to increased sales in display technologies and environmental technologies were partially offset by much lower sales in conventional video components that we exited and lower sales in other technologies products 
segment earnings for were down compared to the prior year 
improved operating performance from display technologies and environmental technologies were partially offset by the shutdown of cav and decreased earnings in the semiconductor materials product line

the following discussion of products in the technologies segment excludes the restructuring and impairment charges and credits to provide clarity on the underlying business trends 
display technologies sales increased  or million  compared to the increase was primarily due to volume gains of approximately  as penetration of liquid crystal display panels in the desktop market increased  and favorable exchange rates 
earnings doubled in compared to the prior year due to the increase in volume and significant gains in equity earnings from samsung corning precision over the prior year 
in july  we announced an million expansion of our liquid crystal display glass manufacturing facility in taiwan 
the three phased project is expected to be completed by the end of with production to begin in the second quarter of in february  we announced a million expansion of our liquid crystal display glass manufacturing facility in japan and taiwan 
this expansion will occur over and environmental technologies sales increased  or million  compared to the increased sales were primarily due to increased us auto production driven by financing incentives  favorable mix of premium products  favorable exchange rates and higher sales for diesel products 
earnings decreased more than compared to the prior year due to a decrease in equity earnings from cormetech  a us designer and manufacturer of industrial catalysts  and higher development spending for the diesel product line 
life sciences sales were flat in  compared to  primarily due to weak sales in europe and a general softness in the market 
earnings were flat compared to the prior year  primarily due to improved manufacturing efficiencies and a gain on the disposition of a minor product line that was more than offset by higher development spending 
conventional video components sales decreased  or million  compared to the sales declines are due to loss of volume  price declines and our decision to exit cav 
as discussed earlier  we ceased operations in the second quarter of see restructuring  impairment and other charges and credits and note restructuring actions to the consolidated financial statements 
the loss increased compared to the prior year  primarily due to decreased sales volume  continued competitive pricing pressures and equity losses from samsung corning 
although samsung corning generates cash  we expect that our equity earnings from this venture will be lower than historical levels going forward 
further  it is possible that future equity results may include operating losses or significant restructuring or fixed asset impairment charges recorded by samsung corning 
our investment in samsung corning was million at december  other technologies products sales in our other technologies businesses  including semiconductor materials and ophthalmic products  decreased  or million  compared to the decrease was primarily due to lower sales volume of high purity fused silica products  as capital spending in the semiconductor equipment industry remained at relatively low levels  and the exit of the lighting product line in september the losses from other technologies products more than tripled  compared to the prior year 
the losses were primarily due to significantly lower sales volume and increased spending in development and engineering for calcium fluoride products 
due to the cyclicality of the semiconductor equipment market  we are consolidating the semiconductor materials manufacturing facilities to attain greater flexibility than we have in our current cost structure 
as a result  we recorded impairment and restructuring charges and accelerated depreciation as discussed in restructuring actions and note restructuring actions to the consolidated financial statements 
vs 
sales in the technologies segment during decreased  or million  compared to  as increased sales in display technologies  environmental technologies and life sciences were offset by much lower sales in the mature conventional video components product line  decreased demand for semiconductor materials and the impact of corning s exit of its lighting products line in segment earnings increased  or million  compared to  as improved operating performance in display technologies and life sciences and stronger equity earnings were partially offset by restructuring and impairment charges and decreased earnings in the semiconductor materials and conventional video components products 
the restructuring costs recorded in this segment consisted entirely of severance and benefits for retired and separated employees in several businesses

the following discussion of products in the technologies segment excludes the restructuring and impairment charges and credits to provide clarity on the underlying business trends 
display technologies sales increased  or million  compared to the increase was primarily due to higher sales volume as penetration in the desktop market increased 
the prior year s sales were negatively impacted by an inventory correction in the industry in the first quarter of volume gains of over for were partially offset by price declines of on a constant currency basis 
earnings increased over in  compared to  primarily due to volume gains and a more than improvement in equity earnings from samsung corning precision 
environmental technologies sales increased  or million  compared to  primarily due to increased us auto production driven by financing incentives and strong growth in europe and japan 
earnings improved  compared to  as a significant increase in equity earnings from cormetech  a us designer and manufacturer of industrial catalysts  was partially offset by price declines and increased manufacturing and development costs related to new products 
life sciences sales increased  or million  compared to  primarily due to strong growth in most product lines 
earnings more than doubled over  primarily due to cost savings from the discontinuation of our investment in microarray technology products in the third quarter of  as well as improved manufacturing efficiencies and higher sales 
conventional video components sales decreased  or million  compared to pricing pressure was strong in this market due to increased competition 
a significant portion of cav s business was concentrated with few customers  two of which merged 
the loss increased almost for the year  compared to  primarily due to decreased sales volume and continued competitive pricing pressures 
samsung corning also experienced pricing pressure resulting in an approximate decline in equity earnings for  compared to the prior year 
other technologies products sales decreased  or million  compared to the decrease was led by the exit of the lighting product line and lower sales volume of high purity fused silica products as capital spending in the semiconductor equipment industry remained at relatively low levels 
other technologies products incurred a loss for the year compared to break even results in the losses were primarily due to significantly lower sales volume and increased spending in development and engineering for calcium fluoride products 
outlook we expect sales in the technologies segment to increase in  primarily due to continued growth in our display technologies product line and increased sales of diesel products 
all products in this segment expect improved revenue in we also expect profitability in the segment to improve significantly in due to the strong volume growth in display technologies and increased equity earnings from samsung corning precision 
non segment results our non segment results include the operations of steuben  a crystal glass manufacturer  and equity earnings from nonstrategic investments that are not aligned with our two operating segments 
in addition  the results of operating segments do not include amortization of goodwill  gain on repurchases and retirement of debt  charges related to the asbestos litigation and restructuring and impairment charges related to the corporate research and development or staff organizations 
liquidity and capital resources financing structure in  we completed two equity offerings of our common stock as follows 
million shares in july for net proceeds of million  and

we used the net proceeds of the may offering and million of existing cash to reduce debt through a public tender offer conducted in june 
we used the net proceeds of the july offering to reduce debt through open market repurchases 
see note shareholders equity to the consolidated financial statements 
we repurchased and retired approximately million zero coupon convertible debentures in for approximately billion in cash and million shares of treasury common stock 
see note long term debt and loans payable to the consolidated financial statements for further detail 
as a result of our debt repurchase program  we reduced the balance of zero coupon convertible debentures as follows december  december  december  zero coupon convertibles   the remaining zero coupon convertible debentures will likely be put back to us on november   at per debenture and on november   at per debenture 
we have the option of settling this obligation in cash  common stock  or a combination of both 
from time to time  we may retire additional debt securities for cash or equity 
due to our debt ratings  we continue to be precluded from accessing the short term commercial paper market 
the terms that we could receive on any new long term debt issues would likely be consistent with those generally available to high yield issuers 
as an additional source of funds  we currently have full unrestricted access to a billion revolving credit facility with banks  expiring on august  as of december   there were no borrowings under the credit facility 
the facility includes one financial covenant limiting the ratio of total debt to total capital  as defined  to not greater than 
at december  and december   this ratio was and  respectively 
in march  we filed a universal shelf registration statement with the sec that became effective in the first quarter of the shelf permits the issuance of up to billion of various debt and equity securities 
as of march   our remaining capacity under the shelf registration statement was approximately billion 
subsequent event through march   we repurchased and retired thousand zero coupon convertible debentures for approximately million in cash resulting in a net decrease of million to the zero coupon convertible debenture book value 
in addition  we issued million shares of corning common stock and million in cash in exchange for convertible debentures with a book value of million at an effective conversion price of per share 
as a result of these transactions  we will record a million pre tax loss on repurchases and retirement of debt during the first quarter of capital spending capital spending totaled million  million and billion in  and  respectively 
our capital spending program is expected to be in the range of million to million  of which million to million will be to expand the capacity for liquid crystal display glass

management assessment of liquidity our major source of funding for and beyond will be our existing balance of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
from time to time we may also issue debt or equity securities to raise additional cash to fund a portion of our capital expenditures related to our growth businesses 
we believe we have sufficient liquidity for the next several years to fund operations  restructuring  the asbestos settlement  research and development  capital expenditures and scheduled debt repayments 
we may accelerate some or all of the funding of the cash payments to the asbestos settlement trust  as needed  to maximize the tax benefits we can realize in connection with the related settlement charges 
off balance sheet arrangements we have two variable interest entities vies that are not consolidated as we are not the primarily beneficiary 
the assets and debt of these entities total million 
our maximum loss exposure as a result of our involvement with these vies is approximately million

we have agreed to provide a credit facility related to dow corning as discussed in note investments to the consolidated financial statements 
the funding of the dow corning credit facility is subject to events connected to the bankruptcy plan 
we believe the significant majority of these guarantees and contingent liabilities will expire without being funded 
in january  the sec released fr  disclosure in management s discussion and analysis about off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations 
in response to this guidance  we have assessed our off balance sheet and contractual obligations and have determined that in addition to previously disclosed items  purchase obligations would be added 
given the nature of purchase obligations  we limited our assessment to individual items outstanding at december  greater than million 
pensions we have a number of defined benefit pension plans covering certain domestic and international employees 
our largest single pension plan is corning s us qualified plan 
at december   this plan accounted for of our consolidated defined benefit pension plans projected benefit obligation and of the related plans assets 
in  global capital market developments resulted in negative returns on plan assets and a decline in the discount rate used to estimate the related pension liability 
in  although global equities had positive returns  interest rates continued to decline 
as a result  at december  and  the accumulated benefit obligation abo for our domestic qualified and non qualified plans and several international plans exceeded the fair value of related plan assets  which required corning to record an additional minimum pension liability in accordance with sfas no

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein 
the estimates that required us to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments follow 
impairment of goodwill sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires us to make certain difficult  subjective and complex judgments on a number of matters  including assumptions and estimates used to determine the fair value of our reporting units and the definition of our reporting units 
we measure fair value on the basis of discounted expected future cash flows 
our estimates are based upon our historical experience  our current knowledge from our commercial relationships  and available external information about future trends 
the criteria for establishing a reporting unit is dependent upon how a company determines its operating segments under sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
specifically  sfas no 
permits a company to define a reporting unit as either an operating segment  a component of an operating segment or an aggregation of two or more components of an operating segment 
the reporting unit for the telecommunications segment goodwill is the telecommunications operating segment 
the reporting units for the technologies segment are components of the technologies segment 
at december   the telecommunications and technologies operating segment goodwill balances were billion and million  respectively 
during  we completed our annual goodwill impairment test  determined the telecommunications goodwill balance was impaired  and recorded a related impairment charge of million 
our testing results also determined that the technologies segment goodwill was not impaired 
in the fourth quarter of  we completed our annual goodwill impairment tests and determined that the goodwill balances were not impaired 
as discussed in more detail below  while we believe the estimates and judgments about future cash flows used in the goodwill impairment tests are reasonable  we cannot provide assurance that future impairment charges will not be required if the expected cash flow estimates as projected by management do not occur 
we are currently in discussion with the staff of the sec on the determination of our operating segments 
we believe that our determination of our operating segments under sfas no 
is appropriate 
however  it is possible that the outcome of this discussion could be a revision of how we define and disclose our operating segments 
it is also possible that a change in how we define our telecommunications operating segment could impact our goodwill impairment tests under sfas no 
specifically  we could be required to record a net additional goodwill impairment charge of up to million pre tax in although this potential charge would increase our net loss  it would not impact our operating cash flows because goodwill impairments are noncash charges 
our debt to capital ratio ranged from to throughout this potential charge would have increased our debt to capital ratio to no higher than  which would still be below the financial covenant limit relating to our billion revolving credit facility 
the potential goodwill impairment charge would have no impact on operating results or operating cash flows for the year ended december  telecommunications our expectation is that there will be minimal volume growth in the short term  volume growth is assumed to accelerate beginning in commensurate with overall market recovery 
terminal value of the business assumes a growth in perpetuity of 
these cash flows are also used to value intangible and tangible assets which determine the implied value of reporting unit goodwill 
the discount rate applied to these cash flows represents a telecommunications weighted average cost of capital based upon current debt and equity activity of eleven public companies representing a cross section of worldwide competitors of the reporting unit 
for our annual test  we used a discount rate of in our calculation of fair value of the expected future cash flows 
an impairment charge of million was recorded in had we used a discount rate of  the fair value of the reporting unit would have exceeded its carrying value  and there would not have been impairment 
had we used a discount rate of  the pre tax impairment charge would have been approximately million higher 
in  we also used a discount rate for our annual impairment test 
the results of our test indicated that goodwill was not impaired 
the results would not have changed had we used a discount rate of or 
technologies due to market conditions  we determined that a detailed impairment test of the specialty materials reporting unit was required in the fourth quarter of while there was a significant decrease in sales in in this reporting unit due to the cyclicality of the semiconductor industry  we expect increased volume growth beginning in our discounted cash flow test for this reporting unit assumes a perpetuity growth rate of 
the discount rate applied to the forecasted cash flows represents weighted average cost of capital based upon current debt and equity activity of eight public companies representing a cross section of worldwide competitors of the reporting unit 
we used a discount rate of in our calculation of fair value of the expected future cash flows 
the results of our test indicated that goodwill was not impaired 
the results would not have changed had we used a discount rate of or 
impairment of assets held for use sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  requires us to assess the recoverability of the carrying value of long lived assets when an event of impairment has occurred 
we must exercise judgment in assessing whether an event of impairment has occurred 
for purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment loss  a long lived asset or assets is grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
we must exercise judgment in assessing the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
we concluded events of impairment had occurred in our semiconductor materials product line  which is part of the specialty materials business  in the fourth quarter of  and performed an impairment test 
the results of our test indicated that our long lived assets held for use were not impaired 
in  we recorded pre tax charges totaling million primarily related to the photonics and conventional television product lines 
in each circumstance  behavior of external parties  including customers and competitors  were considered in the determination of whether an impairment was required 
we also exercised judgment in the determination of expected future cash flows against which to compare the carrying value of the asset group being evaluated 
for the impairment in  we exercised judgment in determining the fair value of the assets from which the impairment charge was measured 
for our photonic technologies products  we based the fair value of our long lived assets on the actual results of recent asset auctions of similar equipment 
for the assets related to our conventional television product line  we exercised judgment about alternative volume and sales price scenarios  computed discounted cash flows  and assigned our best estimate of probability to each alternative 
we reduced the useful lives of the fixed assets of cav as a result of this assessment 
restructuring charges and impairments resulting from restructuring actions during and  we recorded write downs of property  plant and equipment as a result of decisions to exit facilities  primarily in the telecommunications segment 
assets impaired were primarily equipment  construction in progress and buildings  which were sold or abandoned 
we used information available from recent auctions of telecommunications equipment to estimate salvage value when measuring impairment 
the estimated salvage values were very low  primarily due to the depressed market for telecommunications related equipment 
the salvage values of property impaired were also estimated to be minimal as certain facilities will be abandoned and not sold 
we have had significant reversals in  and it is possible that actual results will differ from assumptions and require adjustments to reserves 
valuation allowances for deferred income taxes sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires us to exercise judgment about our future results in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
at december   corning had gross deferred tax assets of billion 
we determined that the likelihood of realization of certain deferred tax assets is less than and recorded valuation allowances of million 
if future taxable income differs from our estimate  adjustments to these allowances will be required and will impact future net income 
see income taxes and note income taxes to the consolidated financial statements for further detail 
probability of litigation outcomes sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  requires us to make judgments about future events that are inherently uncertain 
in making determinations of likely outcomes of litigation matters  we consider the evaluation of outside counsel knowledgeable about each matter  as well as known outcomes in case law 
see legal proceedings for a detailed discussion of the key litigation matters we face 
the most significant matter involving judgment is the pcc asbestos liability 
there are a number of factors bearing upon our potential liability  including the inherent complexity of a chapter filing  our history of success in defending ourself against asbestos claims  our assessment of the strength of our corporate veil defenses  our continuing dialogue with our insurance carriers and the claimants representatives  and other factors 
we have reached a tentative settlement on pcc as disclosed in legal proceedings and note investments to the consolidated financial statements 
the settlement is subject to a number of contingencies  including a favorable vote by of the asbestos claimants voting on the pcc plan  and approval by the bankruptcy court 
pension assumptions in  we made a change in assumption that impacted pension expense in future periods 
specifically  we lowered our expected long term rate of return on pension assets from to 
we did not alter the nature of the pension trust investments 
asset performance in had been below the assumption 
as such  we lowered our long term rate of return assumption 
in  this increased our pension expense as measured in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pension  compared to amounts recorded in the increase was approximately million in in  our actual return on plan assets approximated  however  we will continue to hold our expected long term rate of return at 
environment we have been named by the environmental protection agency under the superfund act  or by state governments under similar state laws  as a potentially responsible party for twelve active hazardous waste sites 
under the superfund act  all parties who may have contributed any waste to a hazardous waste site  identified by such agency  are jointly and severally liable for the cost of cleanup unless the agency agrees otherwise 
it is our policy to accrue for its estimated liability related to superfund sites and other environmental liabilities related to property owned and operated by us based on expert analysis and continual monitoring by both internal and external consultants 
we have accrued approximately million for our estimated liability for environmental cleanup and related litigation at december  based upon the information developed to date  we believe that the accrued amount is a reasonable estimate of our liability and that the risk of an additional loss in an amount materially higher than that accrued is remote 
new accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued a revised sfas no 
 employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits 
the revised standard requires incremental pension and other postretirement benefit plan disclosures to financial statements and is designed to improve disclosure transparency 
the adoption of this accounting standard did not have any effect on our results of operations or financial position 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
 fin which requires all vies to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary 
the primary beneficiary is the entity that holds the majority of the beneficial interests in the vie 
in addition  the interpretation expands disclosure requirements for both vies that are consolidated as well as vies from which the entity is the holder of a significant  but not the majority amount of the beneficial interests 
we have leased equipment from three vies for which the sole purpose is the leasing of equipment to us 
we assessed the impact of this interpretation and determined that we are the primary beneficiary of one of these existing vies  and therefore  began to consolidate this entity beginning on july  at december   the assets and debt of this entity were million and million  respectively 
we also evaluated the impact of this interpretation on the two other entities and determined that we are not the primary beneficiary for either entity 
the assets and debt of these entities total million 
the adoption of this interpretation did not have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position 
in addition  we adopted the following new standards in  which did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations

our exposure to exchange rate effects includes 
exchange rate movements on financial instruments and transactions denominated in foreign currencies which impact earnings  and 
exchange rate movements upon conversion of net assets in foreign subsidiaries for which the functional currency is not the us dollar  which impact our net equity 
our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to japan  korea  taiwan and western european countries 
we selectively enter into foreign exchange forward and option contracts with durations generally months or less to hedge our exposure to exchange rate risk on foreign source income and purchases 
the hedges are scheduled to mature coincident with the timing of the underlying foreign currency commitments and transactions 
the objective of these contracts is to neutralize the impact of exchange rate movements on our operating results 
we also enter into foreign exchange forward contracts when situations arise where our foreign subsidiaries or corning enter into lending situations  generally on an intercompany basis  denominated in currencies other than their local currency 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
equity in earnings of associated companies has historically contributed a significant amount of our income from continuing operations 
equity in earnings of associated companies  net of impairments was million in with foreign based affiliates comprising over of this amount 
samsung corning and samsung corning precision totaled million in equity earnings for exchange rate fluctuations and actions taken by management of these entities to reduce this risk can affect the earnings of these companies 
we use a sensitivity analysis to assess the market risk associated with our foreign currency exchange risk 
market risk is defined as the potential change in fair value of assets and liabilities resulting from an adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates 
at december   we had open forward contracts  open option contracts  foreign denominated debt with values exposed to exchange rate movements  all of which were designated as hedges at december  a adverse movement in quoted foreign currency exchange rates could result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of million 
the nature of our foreign exchange rate risk exposures has not changed materially from december  interest rate risk management in march and april of  we entered into three interest rate swaps that are fair value hedges and economically exchanged a notional amount of million of fixed rate long term debt to floating rate debt 
under the terms of the swap agreements  we pay the counterparty a floating rate that is indexed to the six month libor rate and receive the fixed rates of to  which are the stated interest rates on the long term debt instruments 
as a result of these transactions  corning was exposed to the impact of interest rate changes 
the interest rate on these instruments is reset every six months  and they expire in to years 
in september  we terminated two of the interest rate swap agreements described above with a notional amount of million 
the termination of these swaps resulted in a million gain which we will amortize to earnings as a reduction of interest expense over the remaining life of the debt 
the cash proceeds from the termination of the swap agreement totaled million and is included in the financing section of our consolidated cash flow statement 
as of december   we have one remaining swap agreement in effect with a notional amount of million 
it is our policy to conservatively manage our exposure to changes in interest rates 
our policy sets a maximum cap that total variable rate debt will not exceed of the total debt portfolio at anytime 
at december   our consolidated debt portfolio contained approximately of variable rate instruments
