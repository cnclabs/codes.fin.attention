item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations overview our mission is to improve the quality and reduce the cost of patient care  and to speed drug discovery 
we develop  manufacture and market a versatile automated digital microscope system with the ability to detect  count and classify cells based on color  size and shape to assist pathologists in making critical medical decisions that can affect patient treatment 
the acis automated cellular imaging system combines an automated microscope with computer based color imaging technology originally developed for the us government s star wars program 
the fda cleared acis device is currently being used by pathologists and researchers to analyze specimens placed on slides and stained with color producing  commercially available reagents 
the system s ability to overcome the limitations of the human eye even when aided by a microscope dramatically improves the observer s ability to analyze cells and tissue 
over peer reviewed clinical data and publications have demonstrated that the acis digital microscope and proprietary software can considerably improve accuracy and consistency over other methods of laboratory testing 
chromavision brings standardization  accuracy and reproducibility to anatomic pathology  an area of the laboratory focused on esoteric tests  which have traditionally been analyzed manually 
in a multi pathologist clinical study  observers improved their rates of correlation with an independent standard from a range of to scoring manually to to using acis 
even the most accurate pathologist scoring manually was able to achieve improved accuracy using acis 
the company s main clinical customers are pathology practices  of which there are approximately  in the united states  hospitals  which the company estimates to number approximately  and regional national reference laboratories that perform a variety of clinical testing procedures including those using the chromavision acis device 
larger hospitals  those generally with beds or more  are most likely to desire the acis because of the economies of scale that come from their larger test volumes 
smaller community hospitals  who often have small test volumes and lack laboratory facilities  are good candidates for the access remote viewing station 
for these customers  the staining and imaging of their tissue samples have historically been performed by chromavision s reference lab partners 
beginning in approximately april  chromavision intends to begin providing these services directly through its own in house laboratory services group in support of the growing access remote pathology program 
the images will then be distributed back to the access customer for viewing and scoring locally with their access workstation 
the keys to continued success in penetrating these markets are adequate reimbursement  medical efficacy as demonstrated by clinical studies and fda clearances  and expansion of the menu of tests performed by acis to bring greater economies of scale to our accounts operations 
the decision to provide in house laboratory services was made to give the company an opportunity to capture a significant service related revenue stream and to optimize the level of service and accuracy provided to remote pathology customers 
the initial objective of the company s service strategy is to support the expansion of the access program  a rapidly growing customer segment 
the focus has been on developing an important technology platform to assist our customers in their diagnostic evaluation of cancer  and having achieved that goal we are exploring a number of ways to leverage that position  better serve customer needs and expand revenue opportunities in doing so 
a logical extension of the access technical services  will be the introduction of other esoteric tests that support the oncology services marketplace 
the company will be evaluating the introduction of these other services  which may include flow cytometry  molecular medicine  analysis of tumors of unknown origin  and cytogenetics  for example  as the access laboratory services business comes online 
the company s ability to provide these new oncology services will be strongly dependent on its financial resources and will take place in a phased approach as these financial resources become available 
the company has placed an increasing level of importance on the sale of the acis system to research accounts  which include biopharmaceutical companies  biotechnology companies  and academic medical centers 
management believes that there are more than  such organizations in the united states that are good candidates for the acis 
this is a customer group that will be increasingly important for the company in the coming years because of the large size of this market and the collaborative development opportunities that these customers provide for the development of new diagnostic tests using acis 
important criteria for these customers include the flexibility and ease of use of the system  the accuracy of the system as a measurement tool in the performance of clinical trials and research studies  and the inclusion of certain key features necessary to researchers such as fluorescence or tissue micro array capabilities 
a very important driver of the company s success in the future will be its ability to develop new diagnostic tests on the acis  duplicating the success and market penetration that has been achieved within the breast cancer markets  where chromavision estimates that as many as of all breast cancer cases are tested using acis 
working in collaboration with five of the eight top tier pharmaceutical companies  the company is developing diagnostic tests and related assays that will target new cancer therapies to those 
table of contents patients most likely to benefit from their use 
we believe the increasing shift towards an aging us population  a group in which cancer incidence is greater  the large pipeline of targeted cancer therapies in various stages of clinical study  and the increasingly high cost of these drugs will result in a large and ripe market for proven diagnostic tests 
chromavision s future success will rest in large part on its ability to develop and introduce these tests using its proprietary imaging technology and to expand its installed base of clinical system placements in the marketplace 
an important component of the company s strategy is to continue to build and  when necessary  defend its intellectual property position 
currently  chromavision has issued or allowed patents that were approved over known prior art 
seven key us patents cover the major features necessary to develop a competitive image analysis system and cover important system features such as autoloading  whole tissue imaging  multiple magnifications  and thresholds in hue  intensity and saturation 
asserting chromavision s intellectual property rights could be critical to supporting the company s strategy and in advancing its leadership position 
in february  chromavision filed suit against applied imaging corporation nasdaq aicx 
the lawsuit  filed in the united states district court for the southern district of california  asserts applied imaging s ariol sl system infringes upon three chromavision patents 
chromavision has asked the court for damages and an injunction barring applied imaging from making  using  importing  selling  or offering for sale any device that infringes chromavision patented technology 
in its complaint  chromavision has asserted the applied imaging s product infringes upon three chromavision patents relating to image analysis and automated microscopy 
those three patents are united states patent no 
b  entitled method and apparatus for automated image analysis of biological specimens  united states patent no 
b  entitled method and apparatus for applying color thresholds in light microscopy  and united states patent no 
b  entitled histological reconstruction and automated image analysis 
further distinguishing chromavision s thought leadership in automated immunohistochemistry are the five fda k clearances that the company has generated over the past several years 
these clearances help to validate the efficacy of the company s technology and to broaden the acceptance of chromavision image analysis 
it will be important for the company to add to its fda clearance portfolio for those new diagnostic tests developed in the company s biopharma development efforts 
the company operates out of its san juan capistrano  california corporate office where all manufacturing of the acis device takes place 
chromavision maintains a sales and service organization distributed around the country and serves the european markets through a small staff that coordinates a broad distributor network in most of the european countries 
safeguard scientifics  inc  a pennsylvania corporation whose shares are listed on the new york stock exchange  owns beneficially approximately of the outstanding shares of our common stock 
we refer to safeguard scientifics  inc and its wholly owned subsidiaries as safeguard 
as a result of this stock ownership  safeguard has the ability to elect all of our directors  and it also has significant contractual rights to control our business 
see note of notes to condensed consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our condensed consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the dates of the balance sheets and revenues and expenses for the periods presented 
therefore  on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those provisions for bad debts and reserves for acis in progress 
for estimated bad debts  we review on an individual account basis the age of the receivable  all circumstances surrounding the transaction that gave rise to the receivable and whether the customer continues to have the financial resources to pay the receivable as of the balance sheet date and prior to the issuance of the financial statements for the related period 
for acis in progress  the respective reserve is based upon the expected future use of the acis components based upon proposed design changes  high value components that may be discontinued in the near future and whether there are any lower of cost or market considerations 
for other obligations  where judgment is required  we review the circumstances surrounding the obligation and evaluate the facts and circumstances to determine an appropriate level of accrual for each obligation 
we place most of our instruments with users on a fee per use basis 
we obtain the billing information via modem  which accesses the acis database 
revenue is recognized based on the greater of actual usage fees or the minimum monthly rental fee 
under this pricing model  we own most of the acis instruments that are engaged in service and  accordingly  all related depreciation and maintenance and service costs are expensed as incurred 
for those instruments that are sold  we recognize and defer revenue using the residual method pursuant to the requirements of statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition sop  as amended by statement of position no 
 modification of sop  software revenue recognition with respect to certain arrangements 
at the outset of the arrangement with the customer  we defer revenue for the fair value of its undelivered elements eg  maintenance and recognize revenue for the remainder of the arrangement fee attributable to the elements initially delivered in 
table of contents the arrangement eg  software license when the basic criteria in sop have been met 
maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance contract  typically months 
revenue on product sales is recognized upon acceptance by the customer subsequent to a testing and evaluation period 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  fee per use 
revenue for the year ended december  increased approximately million or over the comparable period in due primarily to an increase in the aggregate number of acis placements but partially offset by a decrease in average monthly revenue for acis placements and remote viewing stations 
the number of systems in the field generating fee per use charges increased from to the average monthly revenue for acis placements and remote viewing stations was approximately  and  respectively  as compared to  and  for the comparable period in our business plan focuses on placing the acis under a lease arrangement in which the customer is charged based on the number of tests performed  subject to a minimum monthly payment 
as discussed below under liquidity and capital resources we intend to introduce in a modified sales transaction which combines the aspects of a system sale with a fee per use license fee 
the decline in the average monthly revenue is primarily due to pricing concessions offered to our customers in response to lower reimbursement levels see discussion following under uncertainties to future operations and a decline in the monthly minimum revenue amount for certain customers 
also impacting fee per use revenue is an increase in the reserve for sales allowances 
the charge taken against revenue in for sales allowances increased by  over the comparable period in due  in part  to the recent reduction in the amount of reimbursement paid by medicare to our customers 
we anticipate that the average monthly system revenue will continue to be negatively impacted due to the new medicare reimbursement rates by an amount that will depend on the geographic area of the customer different areas have different levels of reimbursement  the test volume of the account  and the nature in which our customers submit claims for reimbursement 
in addition  see previous discussions under overview and collaborations regarding the termination in february of our relationship with our largest customer 
this action could have a negative impact on our fee per use revenues 
system sales 
revenue for the year ended december  increased approximately  or over the comparable period in due primarily to an increase in the number of units sold 
six systems were sold during as compared to four for the comparable period in system sales contributed of total revenue for as compared to for the comparable period in revenue from system sales can fluctuate significantly principally due to the infrequent and limited number of system sales 
the company intends to place a greater emphasis on selling acis systems to research accounts and anticipates that system sale revenue will become a larger component of total revenue in the future 
these efforts will be facilitated by an increase in sales staff for these purposes and greater development of acis system features most attractive to this customer segment 
cost of revenue 
cost of revenue for the year ended december  increased approximately  or over the comparable period in due primarily to the increase in system placements 
in we reclassified customer service costs to costs of sale rather than development cost  as in prior periods 
this change was made in order to better match these costs with related sales activity 
the effect of this reclassification is approximately  and  for the year ended december  and  respectively 
cost of revenue primarily consists of cost for manufacturing the acis  which includes the cost for direct material  labor costs and manufacturing overhead 
for fee per use revenue the cost of the acis is depreciated over a three year time period and for a system sale the entire cost of the acis system is recognized at the time of sale 
the gross margin  as a percentage of total revenue for the year ended december  was as compared to for the comparable period in the gross margin increase is primarily due to the decline in the material costs of our acis system 
management believes that there are opportunities for further system hardware cost reduction and is investigating several potential opportunities to lower the cost of the key components to the system  such as cameras  autoloaders  bar code readers  monitors  and computer cpu 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
expenses for the year ended december  increased approximately  or over the comparable period in the increase for the twelve month period includes increased severance and recruiting costs of  and increased tradeshow and advertising expenditures of  the increase related to these charges was offset by decreases related to depreciation and travel for  and  respectively 
research and development expenses 
expenses for the year ended december  decreased by approximately  or  over the comparable period in the decrease for the twelve month period is due to the recent reduction in personnel costs as a result of the third quarter workforce reduction 
management believes that sufficient resources exist currently to support the development of new features for the clinical and research markets 
these new development activities  which are intended to produce features that could expand the volume of clinical tests supported by acis and increase the attractiveness of the acis as a tool for researchers  are important to increasing clinical system test volume  expanding the count of clinical system placements  and increasing research system sales 
other income expense 
other expense for the year ended december  consisted of approximately  of interest expense resulting primarily from borrowings under our million equipment financing agreement 
the borrowings under the equipment 
table of contents financing agreement began in september no such borrowings existed for the comparable period in offsetting the interest expense was approximately  of interest income as compared to  for the comparable period in the higher interest income during is primarily a result of a higher cash balance resulting from our august sale of common stock 
preferred stock accretion and dividends 
our net loss attributable to common stock for included a charge of million  which included a million charge for a write off of the unamortized discount on the outstanding shares of our series d preferred stock 
no such charge was incurred for the comparable periods in due to the conversion of all of the outstanding shares of series d preferred stock into common stock in august  which eliminated charges for accretion of  and dividends on  the series d preferred stock in subsequent periods 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  fee per use 
revenue increased approximately million or over the comparable period in due primarily to an increase in acis placements resulting from an increased acceptance in the marketplace 
the number of accounts in the field generating fee per use charges increased from to the average monthly revenue for acis placements and remote viewing stations was approximately  and  respectively  as compared to  and  for the comparable period in our business plan for focused on placing the acis under a lease arrangement in which the customer is charged based on the number of tests performed  subject to a minimum monthly payment 
system sales 
revenue from system sales decreased approximately  or over the comparable period in due primarily to fluctuations in the number of units sold 
four systems were sold during as compared to nine for the comparable period in system sales contributed of total revenue for as compared to for the comparable period in revenue from system sales can fluctuate significantly principally due to the infrequent and limited number of system sales 
cost of revenue 
cost of revenue primarily consists of cost for manufacturing the acis  which includes the cost for direct material  labor costs and manufacturing overhead 
for fee per use revenue the cost of the acis is depreciated over a three year time period and for a system sale the entire cost of the acis system is recognized at the time of sale 
cost of revenue for was approximately million as compared to million for the corresponding period in the increase in cost of revenues was due primarily to the increase in system placements 
the gross margin  as a percentage of total revenue for was as compared to for the comparable period in the gross margin increase is primarily due to the decline in the material costs of our acis system 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
expenses increased approximately  or over the comparable period in the increase is primarily due to the accrual of senior management severance costs  an increase in costs related to our expanded sales force and an increase in sales commission related to our revenue growth 
these increases were offset by a reduction in executive recruiting and relocation costs incurred during research and development expenses 
expenses decreased approximately million or over the comparable period in the decline is primarily due to a reduction in personnel and clinical trial costs as we sought to achieve an appropriate level of personnel to support the development of new system capabilities and the continuation of technological advances to the acis 
other income 
other income for the year ended december  decreased approximately  or below the comparable period in due to a decrease in interest earned on our lower cash balance for preferred stock accretion and dividends 
our net loss attributable to common stock for included a charge of million  which consisted of a million charge for a write off of the unamortized discount on the outstanding shares of our series d preferred stock  which were converted into common stock on august   and a million charge for the accretion of dividends on the series d preferred stock 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the write off and accretion are non cash charges  and the conversion of all of the outstanding shares of series d preferred stock eliminates charges for accretion of  and dividends on  the series d preferred stock in subsequent periods 
uncertainties as to future operations the year was our first full year of commercial activity during which we focused primarily on marketing and sales of the acis system as our menu of capabilities performed with the acis expanded and gained commercial acceptance 
although we have experienced consistent and ongoing revenue growth  we still face significant uncertainties  including those discussed below under liquidity and capital resources  which include our ability to achieve market acceptance of the acis and to ensure satisfactory reimbursement by medicare and other third party insurance carriers under new billing codes which have been established for image analysis based testing effective as of january  
table of contents laboratory services provided for patients with the assistance of acis technology are eligible for third party reimbursement using medical billing codes which apply to image analysis based testing 
these billing codes are known as healthcare common procedure coding system hcpcs codes  which include the common procedural terminology  or cpt  codes as the means by which medicare and private insurers identify medical services that are provided to patients in the united states 
cpt codes are established by an independent editorial panel convened by the american medical association ama 
the reimbursement amounts  or relative values  associated with the cpt codes are established by the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms  under a process that involves recommendations from an independent relative value update committee also convened by the ama  with advice from professional societies representing the various medical specialties 
effective april   the cms instituted a national correct coding initiative ncci edit 
the ncci edit significantly reduced from april  to december  the amount of reimbursement previously paid by medicare for services involving automated image analysis by limiting the codes that would be accepted for reimbursement for acis based services 
the cms edit applied directly only to medicare patients 
we estimate that to percent of acis based services are performed for medicare beneficiaries 
we believe that  before the edit  the majority of our customers were being reimbursed approximately per test 
under the ncci interim edit effective until december  customers were reimbursed about per test for medicare patients 
during this time  the edit was adopted to a limited degree by other payers 
a new cpt code for image analysis went into effect on january  under the new code  the total medicare reimbursement for acis based procedures performed in physician offices or independent laboratories will be approximately per test  reflecting a technical component of approximately and a professional component of approximately the technical component involves preparation of the patient sample and running the test on the acis  while the professional component involves the physician s reading and evaluation of the test results 
the actual amount will also vary based upon a geographic factor index for each state and may be higher or lower than the amounts indicated above in particular cases based on one s geographic location 
the adoption of a new cpt code appropriate for image analysis reflects the expanding role of image analysis in pathology and the need for appropriate reimbursement to enable use of this technology by healthcare providers to benefit patients 
potentially  the new cpt code could help to streamline reimbursement for acis users by allowing them to code more specifically for image analysis based services in claims billed to third party payers 
the valuations of the new code are considered interim valuations and are open for comment to influence further adjustments in chromavision will continue working with relevant medical societies and other appropriate constituents to obtain appropriate reimbursement amounts by all payers for providers of image analysis based services 
the goal is to have the amount paid by medicare and other payers for image analysis based services accurately reflect the technology costs  the benefit that image analysis brings to patients  and its positive impact on healthcare economics 
the reduction of reimbursement resulting from the ncci edit and the interim valuations for acis based procedures will not only reduce revenue for current acis customers  but also may result in system returns or cancellations by current customers and may also negatively impact future placements of acis 
chromavision is in the process of determining the ultimate impact of this code on our customers and our business 
in addition  because of the increase in the technical component to reimbursement  chromavision will be required to enter into new contracts with the hospitals that often prepare the slides for analysis 
hospitals typically have longer buying cycles and a more extensive contract evaluation process then the pathology practitioner which may delay the implementation of these contracts 
at the same time  chromavision s current pathologist customers  for whom professional service reimbursement has been reduced  will require more significant rate reductions 
the creation of these split billing agreements  where chromavision will seek fees from both a hospital and pathology practice  have the potential to be difficult to implement and could cause delays in coming to rate agreement 
due to the change in reimbursement effective january   the company s sales representatives have focused a majority of their efforts  during the fourth quarter of  on renegotiating many of the company s fee per use contracts 
as a result  we anticipate a reduction in system placements and fee per use revenue in the near term 
approximately two thirds of our contracts have been renegotiated as of january  representing the majority of those that the company believes will require amendment 
new sales efforts will now be substantially focused on system placement expansion and continued defense of our existing base of installations 
we face risks that our acis and remote viewing systems may become obsolete or their market value may decline below their manufacturing cost 
these risks have increased due to the recent slowdown in system placements and increase in system returns 
some of these risks are mitigated by the depreciation of these systems as they become engaged in service and our ability to upgrade these systems  at a relatively low cost  to meet new application demands 
we also face uncertainties with respect to our ability to complete development of additional tests for the acis 
in order to mitigate the risk that any one test will not be successfully developed  we maintain a pipeline of tests in a prioritized queue so that if any one test is not successfully developed  or market feedback suggests that a test should be given a lower priority  we can align 
table of contents development efforts according to priority 
in addition  the acis system is dependent upon the laboratory producing a quality stained slide for image analysis 
reagent and or stain quality issues by stain manufacturers may impact the rate at which the acis technology is adopted or new applications are added to existing placements 
other uncertainties affecting our business include our ability to implement our new business initiatives  including transitioning from our primary imaging provider to providing these same laboratory services in house  to collaborate successfully with other companies  universities and research centers to develop  initiate and complete clinical trials of new applications for the acis and obtain governmental approvals for the applications 
lack of success in any of these efforts could have a material adverse effect on the future results of our operation and our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to fund operations 
liquidity and capital resources at december  we had approximately million of cash and cash equivalents and million available under our revolving line of credit 
cash used in operating activities was million in due primarily to our net loss of million 
cash used in investing activities of million consisted of capital expenditures related primarily to the manufacture of the acis systems placed with customers in the rate of capital expenditures  as it relates to acis and access equipment purchases for  is expected to be relatively lower than prior years  particularly in the first half of the year  due to the slow pace of signed contracts for new system placements at the end of slow contract signings in the second half of were due primarily to the reduction in medicare reimbursement amounts for acis testing as discussed previously 
contract signings and related placements of new systems and sales of systems to the research markets are expected to increase in the second half of in addition  because of a management decision in the third quarter to terminate agreements with low performing accounts and a limited number of customer cancellations  we have an increase in the supply of returned equipment that is available for placement with new accounts in the future 
our business plan anticipates placing these instruments with users and charging a fee per use for each time the instrument is used to perform a test or to alternatively to sell these systems to research customers 
the manufacture of these instruments will require a significant outlay of cash  subject to the near term supply of returned equipment noted above  for which revenues will be recognized over the lease term 
we intend to fund these expenditures with our current cash resources and with the remaining amount available under the million revolving line of credit 
because these resources may not be adequate to support the entirety of our business expansion needs  we intend to increase our mix of system sales to per use contracts to generate more cash 
the majority of these sales will be to research accounts 
however  we also intend a modified sale transaction with clinical customers that will include a combination of up front purchase cost and long term per use license fees for future test volumes 
this latter approach is one that best fits our smaller acis accounts  those with lower test volumes  and that improves the overall economics for these customers 
cash provided from financing activities in of million was primarily due to the completion of the sale of million of our common stock to safeguard in february and to million of debt financing 
in the stock transaction we issued  shares of our common stock for per share in a private placement to safeguard exempt from the registration requirements under the securities act 
in february we entered into a million revolving credit agreement with the technology and life sciences division of comerica bank california nyse cma 
this one year agreement has been renewed for a second year to february the borrowings under the line of credit will be used for working capital purposes and will bear interest at comerica s prime rate plus one half percent 
the agreement also includes a one time facility fee of  a fee of 
on the unused balance of the line of credit  various restrictive covenants and requirements to maintain certain financial ratios 
borrowings under the line of credit are guaranteed by safeguard in exchange for a one time fee of  and an amount equal to per annum of the daily weighted average principal balance outstanding under the line of credit 
the company failed to satisfy certain financial covenants under the loan agreement as of the end of august  and in october the lender waived these failures to satisfy the covenants and agreed to modify the covenants 
the bank modified the convenants on january  the company was in compliance with the revised covenants at december  the renewed agreement that begins in february now has only one financial covenant related to tangible net worth  which must be greater than through june  and greater than  thereafter 
management believes that it will remain in compliance for the next twelve months with this convenant 
in august we entered into a million equipment financing agreement with ge capital 
the loan principal amortizes ratably over a month term 
the borrowings under the equipment financing agreement are being used for working capital purposes and bear interest at basis points over the three year treasury constant maturities rates at or time of borrowing 
the agreement also provides for an incremental million of financing availability upon reaching certain system placement objectives  various restrictive covenants  maintenance of certain financial ratios and a collateral monitoring fee of  per year 
in september  the entire million available under the financing agreement was borrowed with an interest rate of 
as of december   million of debt remains outstanding with approximately million of the debt classified as current and million as long term 

table of contents borrowings under the equipment financing agreement are secured by substantially all of the company s assets 
the equipment financing agreement incorporates some of the restrictive covenants and certain other requirements of the comerica revolving credit agreement  including any subsequent amendments granted by comerica with respect to the incorporated covenants 
the agreement also includes a provision whereby a material adverse change to the company s financial condition could be considered an event of default 
the company believes  however  that based on current operations  committed borrowings and the million received from a private placement with safeguard in february  it will remain in compliance with its debt covenants over the next twelve months and that it is not probable that ge will exercise the material adverse change clause as an event of default 
the ge agreement prohibits additional equipment financing until system placements reach certain thresholds 
this restriction will limit the company s access to capital and may limit our ability to expand 
our losses from operations are expected to continue during the near term 
in february the company issued  shares of common stock for an aggregate cash purchase price of million per share and warrants to purchase an additional  shares of common stock at per share in a private placement to safeguard exempt from the registration requirements of the securities act 
as a result of the transaction  safeguard s percentage of beneficial ownership increased from to 
we believe that our existing cash resources  the remaining balance of the million revolving line of credit and the proceeds from the million private placement in february from safeguard will be sufficient to satisfy our cash needs during the next twelve months and to enable the company to stay in compliance with its debt agreements 
however  we may need to seek additional debt or equity financing to fund our current development activities  clinical studies and or regulatory activities 
expansion of our new business initiatives will likely require additional debt or equity financing 
we may in the near future raise additional financing in a private placement exempt from the registration requirements of the securities act of  as amended the securities act  to  among other things  fund the implementation and expansion of our new business initiatives 
any equity or debt securities issued in connection with such a private placement would be offered solely to a limited number of accredited investors pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the securities act  would not be registered under the securities act and could not be offered or sold except pursuant to a registration statement under the securities act or an exemption from the registration requirements of the securities act 
no such offer or sale is made hereby 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing when needed or on terms that are favorable to the company and its stockholders 
in addition  if additional funds are raised through an equity or convertible debt financing  our stockholders may experience significant dilution 
we currently lease our corporate headquarters and manufacturing facility under an operating lease arrangement 
the lease expired in february and we exercised our option to extend the lease one year 
our purchase obligations represent commitments primarily for the purchase of materials for the manufacture of our acis 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commercial commitments at december  payment due by period in thousands and contractual obligations total beyond long term debt obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations total off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements that provide financing  liquidity or market or credit risk support or involve leasing  hedging or research and development services for our business or other similar arrangements that may expose us to liability that is not expressly reflected in the financial statements  except for facilities and automobile operating leases 
at december   we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as such we are not subject to any material financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk historically  we have invested excess cash in short term debt securities that are intended to be held to maturity 
these short term investments typically have various maturity dates which do not exceed one year 
we had no short term investments as of december  two of the main risks associated with these investments are interest rate risk and credit risk 
typically  when interest rates rise  there is a corresponding decline in the market value of debt securities 
fluctuations in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial statements because of the short term nature of the securities in which we invest and our intention to hold the securities to maturity 
credit risk refers to the possibility that the issuer of the debt securities will not be able to make principal and interest payments 
we have limited the investments to investment grade or comparable securities and have not experienced any losses on our investments to date due to credit risk 
changes in foreign exchange rates  and in particular a strengthening of the us dollar  may negatively affect our consolidated sales and gross margins as expressed in us dollars 
to date  we have not entered into any foreign exchange contracts to hedge our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
however  as our international operations grow  we may enter into such arrangements in the future 
effective january   our foreign sales were denominated in euros 
foreign currency denominated sales have not been significant
