actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of a number of factors  including those set forth under business risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
general we and our subsidiaries  tulsat  lee enterprise  ncs  comtech services  tulsat texas and tulsat atlanta comprise an organization involved in the re manufacture  repair and sale of previously owned cable television catv equipment and the distribution of new and surplus equipment to catv operators 
new sales are defined as products that are purchased from the manufacturer  and includes new surplus  which is defined as inventory items purchased from other distributors or msos with excess equipment that have never been used 
remanufactured sales are defined as used inventory that is updated to meet customer needs and requirements 
overview it is difficult to time the placing of orders in our business due to cyclical conditions that exist in the broadband and cable industry and present economic conditions that affect it 
fiscal continued to be a challenging business environment in the industry due to a significant reduction in capital spending that began in fiscal we believe we are in a unique position to service those msos  which are looking to minimize costs 
we have a large inventory of new and used equipment  million and million  respectively  at september  we also offer repair services  which are available to our customers who include some of the largest cable operators in the industry 
the industry conditions have affected all equipment suppliers  and we have worked to minimize the negative impact of these conditions on our financial results and operations 
we have aggressively sought to stimulate sales by marketing our products and services to the larger msos  and we have managed our receivables to minimize any bad debt write offs 
our efforts have resulted in increasing sales in a slowly expanding economy over last year  while minimizing the overall impact of bad debts written off in total compared to net income 
however  our largest risk is our investment in inventory 
after consideration of continued analysis  review  and evaluation of our inventory  we recorded an allowance for excess and obsolete inventory of  representing of inventory at september  at september   this allowance amounted to  we expect fiscal to continue the trend of increasing sales based on preliminary results from increased sales in the first quarter of compared to first quarter however  there is no assurance that revenues in fiscal will continue to exceed those for comparable periods in fiscal due to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report

critical accounting policies and estimates note to the consolidated financial statements in this form k for fiscal year includes a summary of the significant accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
some of those significant accounting policies or methods require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported by us 
we believe the following items require the most significant judgments and often involve complex estimates 
general the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience  current market conditions  and various other factors we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the most significant estimates and assumptions relate to the carrying value of our inventory and  to a lesser extent  the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts 
inventory valuation inventory consists of new and used electronic components for the cable television industry 
inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market 
market is defined principally as net realizable value 
cost is determined using the weighted average method 
we market our products primarily to msos and other users of cable television equipment who are seeking products for which manufacturers have discontinued production  or are seeking shipment on a same day basis 
our position in the industry requires us to carry large inventory quantities relative to annual sales  but also allows us to realize high overall gross profit margins on our sales 
carrying these large inventories represents our largest risk 
for individual inventory items  we may carry inventory quantities that are excessive relative to market potential  or we may not be able to recover our acquisition costs for sales that we do make 
in order to address the risks associated with our investment in inventory  we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and reduce the carrying value when the loss of usefulness of an item or other factors  such as obsolete and excess inventories  indicate that cost will not be recovered when an item is sold 
demand for some of the items in our inventory has been impacted by recent economic conditions present in the cable industry 
we recorded an allowance of  or  of the inventory balance at september  as a reserve for excess and obsolete equipment 
we increased this allowance to a total of  or  of the inventory balance at september  any significant  unanticipated changes in product demand  technological developments or continued economic trends affecting the cable industry could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and operating results 
inbound freight charges are included in costs of sales 
purchasing and receiving costs  inspection costs  warehousing costs  internal transfer costs and other inventory expenditures are included in operating expenses since the amounts involved are not considered material 
accounts receivable valuation management judgments and estimates are made in connection with establishing the allowance for doubtful accounts 
specifically  we analyze the aging of accounts receivable balances  historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms 
significant changes in customer concentration or payment terms  deterioration of customer credit worthiness  as in the case of the bankruptcy of adelphia and its affiliates  or weakening in economic trends could have a significant impact on the collectibility of receivables and our operating results 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the reserve for bad debts decreased to  at september  from  at september  this decrease is primarily due to the increasingly optimistic outlook for economic conditions in the coming year 
at september   accounts receivable  net of allowance for doubtful accounts  amounted to million 
impact of recently issued accounting standards in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin requires certain guarantees to be recorded at fair value regardless of the probability of the loss 
the adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  and a revised interpretation of fin fin r in december fin requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
the provisions fin are effective immediately for all arrangements entered into after january  we have not invested in any entities that we believe are variable interest entities for which we are the primary beneficiary 
the adoption of fin r had no impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  which revised arb no 
 relating to inventory costs 
this revision is to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted material spoilage 
this statement requires that these items be recognized as a current period charge regardless of whether they meet the criterion specified in arb in addition  this statement requires the allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  we believe that the adoption of this standard will have no material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to its revolving line of credit 
the interest rates under the line of credit and the stockholder notes fluctuate with the libor rate 
at september   the outstanding balances subject to variable interest rate fluctuations totaled million 
future changes in interest rates could cause our borrowing costs to increase or decrease 
the company maintains no cash equivalents 
however  the company entered into an interest rate swap on september   in an amount equivalent to the million notes payable in order to minimize interest rate risk 
although the note bears interest at the prevailing day libor rate plus  the swap effectively fixed the interest rate at 
the fair value of this derivative will increase or decrease opposite any future changes in interest rates 
all sales and purchases are denominated in us dollars
