table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s overview regis corporation  based in minneapolis  minnesota  is an owner  operator and franchisor of hair and retail product salons and beauty career schools 
our worldwide operations include  system wide north american and international salons  including ten beauty career schools  at june  each of our concepts has generally similar products and services and serves mass market consumers 
our operations are organized to be managed based on geographical location 
our north american operation includes  salons  including  franchise salons  operating in the united states  canada and puerto rico primarily under the trade names of regis salons  mastercuts  trade secret  smartstyle  supercuts and cost cutters 
our international operations include  salons  including  franchise salons  located throughout europe  primarily in the united kingdom  france  italy and spain 
during fiscal year  we had an average of approximately  corporate employees worldwide 
our growth strategy consists of two primary  but flexible  building blocks 
through a combination of organic and acquisition growth  we seek to achieve our long term objective of to percent annual revenue growth 
we anticipate that going forward  the mix of organic and acquisition growth to be roughly equal 
however  depending on several factors  including the availability of appropriate real estate  availability of salons for sale and same store sales trends  this mix will vary from year to year 
we believe achieving revenue growth of to percent will allow us to increase annual earnings at a low to mid teen percent growth rate 
organic revenue growth is achieved through the combination of new salon construction and same store sales increases 
each fiscal year  we anticipate building several hundred corporate salons 
we anticipate our franchisees will open several hundred salons as well 
older  unprofitable salons will be closed or relocated 
our long term outlook is for annual consolidated low single digit same store sales increases 
based on current fashion and economic cycles  we project our fiscal year consolidated same store sales increase to be at the low end of our long term outlook range 
historically  acquisitions have varied in size from as small as one salon to over one thousand salons 
the median acquisition size is approximately salons 
from fiscal year to fiscal year  we completed nearly acquisitions  adding over  salons 
we anticipate adding several hundred corporate salons each year from acquisitions 
some of these acquisitions may include buying salons from our franchisees 
we execute our growth strategy by focusing on real estate 
our real estate strategy is dependent on adding salons in convenient locations with good visibility  strong customer traffic and appropriate trade demographics 
our various salon and product concepts are now operating in a wide range of retailing environments 
we believe that the availability of real estate will augment our ability to achieve the aforementioned long term growth objectives 
we anticipate that we will add approximately  salons each year through a combination of organic  acquisition and franchise growth 
the conceptual strength of our business is in the fundamental similarity of our salon concepts that allow flexibility and multiple salon concept placement in shopping centers and neighborhoods  and broad customer mix 
each concept is targeted at the middle market customer  however each attracts a slightly different demographic 
we anticipate expanding all of our salon concepts 
in addition  we anticipate testing and developing new salon concepts to complement our existing concepts 
we have begun acquiring and are exploring the possibility of building beauty career schools 
the beauty career school business is highly profitable  and often participates in governmental programs designed to encourage education 
we believe there is an opportunity to place graduates in our various salon concepts which may provide us with another competitive advantage 
similar to the salon industry  the beauty career school business is highly fragmented 
as a result  we believe there is an opportunity to consolidate this industry 
expanding this business would allow the company to add incremental revenue without cannibalizing our existing salon business 
primarily through acquisition  we believe beauty career schools could contribute over million in annual revenue in five years 
additionally  we desire to enter the asian market within the next five years

maintaining financial flexibility is a key element in continuing our successful growth 
with strong operating cash flow and an investment grade credit rating  we are confident that we will be able to financially support our long term growth objectives 

table of contents critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
in preparing the consolidated financial statements  we are required to make various judgments  estimates and assumptions that could have a significant impact on the results reported in the consolidated financial statements 
we base these estimates on historical experience and other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
changes in these estimates could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
our significant accounting policies can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this form k 
we believe the following accounting policies are most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial condition and results of operations 
goodwill we review goodwill for impairment annually or at any time events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be fully recoverable 
according to our accounting policy  an annual review was performed during the third quarter of fiscal year  and no impairment was identified 
a similar review will be performed in the third quarter of each year  or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist 
our impairment review process is based on a discounted future cash flow approach that uses estimates of revenues for the reporting units  driven by assumed organic growth rates  estimated future gross margin and expense rates  as well as acquisition integration and maturation  and appropriate discount rates 
these estimates are consistent with the plans and estimates that are used to manage the underlying businesses 
charges for impairment of goodwill for a reporting unit may be incurred in the future if the reporting unit fails to achieve its assumed revenue growth rates or assumed gross margin  or if interest rates increase significantly 
we generally consider our various concepts to be reporting units when we test for goodwill impairment because that is where we believe goodwill naturally resides 
the company believes that the international operations have the highest risk for potential impairment should future revenue growth rates be lower than expected  or interest or tax rates increase 
long lived assets we assess the impairment of long lived assets annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets or the asset grouping may not be recoverable 
our impairment analysis is performed on a salon by salon basis 
factors considered in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant under performance of an individual salon in relation to expectations  significant economic or geographic trends  and significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets 
recoverability of assets that will continue to be used in our operations is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the related total estimated future net cash flows 
if an asset s carrying value is not recoverable through those cash flows  the asset grouping is considered to be impaired 
the impairment is measured by the difference between the assets carrying amount and their fair value  based on the best information available  including market prices or discounted cash flow analysis 
judgments made by management related to the expected useful lives of long lived assets and the ability to realize undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of such assets are affected by factors such as the ongoing maintenance and improvement of the assets  changes in economic conditions and changes in operating performance 
as the ongoing expected cash flows and carrying amounts of long lived assets are assessed  these factors could cause us to realize material impairment charges 
purchase price allocation we make numerous acquisitions 
the purchase prices are allocated to assets acquired  including identifiable intangible assets  and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition 
fair value is estimated based on the amount for which the asset or liability could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties 
for our acquisitions  the majority of the purchase price that is not allocated to identifiable assets  or liabilities assumed  is accounted for as residual goodwill rather than identifiable intangible assets 
this stems from the value associated with the walk in customer base of the acquired salons  the value of which is not recorded as an identifiable intangible asset under current accounting guidance and the limited value and customer preference associated with the acquired hair salon brand 
residual goodwill further represents our opportunity to strategically combine the acquired business with our existing structure to serve a greater number of customers through our expansion strategies 

table of contents revenue recognition for company owned salons company owned salon revenues and related gross margin are recorded at the time of sale  as this is when the services have been provided or  in the case of product revenues  delivery has occurred  and the salon receives the customer s payment 
there are minimal accounting judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of this policy 
based on historical results  refunds to the customer represent less than one percent of total company owned revenues 
the vast majority of returns and refunds occur within a matter of days of the original sales transaction 
a significant increase in returns or refunds could have a material impact on revenues disclosed in the consolidated financial statements 
cost of product used and sold product costs are determined by applying estimated gross profit margins to service and product revenues  which are based on historical factors including product pricing trends and estimated shrinkage 
in addition  the estimated gross profit margin is adjusted based on the results of physical inventory counts performed at least twice a year and the monthly monitoring of factors that could impact our usage rates estimates 
these factors include mix of service sales  discounting and special promotions 
during fiscal year  we performed physical inventory counts in september  january and may and adjusted our estimated gross profit margin to reflect the results of the observations 
significant changes in product costs  volumes or shrinkage could have a material impact on our gross margin 
self insurance accruals we use a combination of third party insurance and self insurance for a number of risks including workers compensation  health insurance and general liability claims 
the liability reflected on our consolidated balance sheet represents an estimate of the undiscounted ultimate cost of uninsured claims incurred as of the balance sheet date 
in estimating this liability  we utilize loss development factors prepared by independent third party actuaries 
these development factors utilize historical data to project the future development of incurred losses 
loss estimates are adjusted based upon actual claims settlements and reported claims 
although we do not expect the amounts ultimately paid to differ significantly from the estimates  self insurance accruals could be affected if future claims experience differs significantly from the historical trends and actuarial assumptions 
contingencies we are involved in various lawsuits and claims that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business 
accruals are recorded for such contingencies based on our assessment that the occurrence is probable  and where determinable  an estimate of the liability amount 
management considers many factors in making these assessments including past history and the specifics of each case 
however  litigation is inherently unpredictable and excessive verdicts do occur  which could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
income taxes in determining income for financial statement purposes  management must make certain estimates and judgements 
certain of these estimates and judgements occur in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets  which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense 
management must assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered 
if recovery is not likely  we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a reserve  in the form of a valuation allowance  for the deferred tax assets that will not be ultimately recoverable 
should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  our tax provision would increase in the period in which it is determined that the recovery is not probable 
in addition  the calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
management recognizes potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the united states and other tax jurisdictions based on its estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due 
if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary  the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when management determines the liabilities are no longer necessary 
if management s estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment  a further charge to expense would result

service revenues were as follows dollars in thousands increase over prior fiscal year same store year ended june  revenues dollar percentage sales increase the growth in service revenues in fiscal years and was driven by acquisitions and organic growth new salon construction and same store sales growth 
fiscal year same store service sales increases were not as robust as in the prior year due to a weaker economic climate 
during fiscal year  same store service sales continued to be modest due to a slight lengthening of customer visitation patterns stemming from a fashion trend towards longer hairstyles  as well as a continuing weak economic climate 
product revenues 
product revenues were as follows dollars in thousands increase over prior fiscal year same store year ended june  revenues dollar percentage sales increase the increases in product revenues demonstrate our strength in merchandising professional salon products 
during fiscal year  product revenues increased basis points to percent of total company owned revenues 
this increase is due primarily to strong same store product sales  coupled with modest same store service sales growth 
same store product sales increases were more robust than in the prior fiscal year primarily due to continual improvement in our merchandising execution  with emphasis placed on management of promotional buying and new product lines 
our merchandising strategy recognizes and stresses the importance of product education and communication with the salons 
in addition  the sale of beauty tools  such as flat irons  was a strong contributor to the increased same store product sales  particularly in trade secret and the international salons 
in fiscal year  product revenues as a percent of total company owned revenues decreased to percent  compared to percent of revenues in fiscal year the decrease as a percent of company owned sales during fiscal year was primarily due to the large number of strip center salons which were acquired over the twelve months ended june  strip center salons have a lower product sales mix than the corporate average

royalties increased during fiscal year primarily due to international franchise salons 
approximately percent of the percent fiscal year increase was related to favorable foreign currency fluctuations

the percent decrease in franchise fees during fiscal year was net of a favorable impact of approximately one percent related to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
sales of product and equipment to franchise salons decreased during fiscal year primarily due to our purchase of franchise salons during the year 
the franchise product revenues contributed by these salons were replaced by company owned product revenues 
further  lower international franchise salon counts as compared to the prior fiscal year and a reduction in the prices of product sold to international franchisees contributed to the decrease in franchise product revenues 
the percent decrease is net of a percent favorable impact related to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
fiscal year versus fiscal year the increase in international franchise revenues during fiscal year  which drove the overall annual increase in consolidated franchise revenues  was primarily due to the acquisition of the european franchise operations during fiscal year approximately seven percent of the percent increase during fiscal year was due to the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
royalties increased during fiscal year primarily related to the acquisitions of the european franchise operations during the first and fourth quarters of fiscal year approximately eight percent of the percent increase during fiscal year was due to the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations

the basis point decrease in service margins during fiscal year was primarily related to an increase in credit card processing fees and state unemployment taxes  partially offset by improved payroll costs as a percent of company owned service revenues 
as a percentage of company owned service revenues  payroll costs were percent in fiscal year  compared with percent in fiscal year and percent in fiscal year these improvements  which were the primary driver of the improvement in service margins during fiscal year  were primarily due to adherence to our labor guidelines and salon level productivity programs

table of contents the fiscal year basis point decrease in product margins was primarily due to the prior fiscal year s favorable physical inventory result stemming from a count performed in the fall of that year  which contributed approximately million to fiscal year reported net income 
the favorable physical inventory result was accounted for as a change in estimate associated with inventory gross profit margins and thus reduced the cost of product sales and was driven primarily by our ability to negotiate favorable terms with our suppliers due to our size and volume of purchases 
we subsequently adjusted our cost of goods usage percentages based on the results of this physical inventory

the improvement in rent expense as a percent of company owned revenues during fiscal year was primarily due to improved common area maintenance charges ie  shared utility and other costs charged by the landlords stemming from continuing scrutiny by management of such expenses 
additionally  same store sales increased in greater magnitude than the fixed cost components of rent expense during the current fiscal year 
the basis point increase in fiscal year rent expense is primarily due to rent expense increasing at a faster rate than same store sales  as well as higher minimum rents related to acquired jld salons in manhattan

in addition  lower franchise product sales  which have a higher cost component than franchise royalties and fees  contributed to the overall improvement 
in fiscal year  franchise direct costs increased as a percent of franchise revenues stemming from the costs associated with implementing this back office integration and a full year of operating costs in europe  as opposed to having european operations for only a fraction of fiscal year

the fiscal year decrease in interest  and improvement as a percent of consolidated revenues  stemmed from our strong cash flow and lower outstanding debt balance as a result of the timing of acquisitions 
in addition  the expiration of million of pay fixed  receive variable interest rate swaps in the fourth quarter of fiscal year contributed to the improvement  as a larger percentage of our total debt was subject to lower short term variable interest rates 
the dollar increase in fiscal year stemmed from a higher average outstanding debt related to the timing of acquisitions 
additionally  we exercised our option under an operating lease to purchase the salt lake city distribution center 
prior to the purchase  the variable payments related to the lease were hedged by an interest rate swap 
at the date of the purchase  a million non cash charge was recognized in interest expense  representing the fair value of the swap at the date of purchase 
for additional information pertaining to our debt structure and interest rates thereon  see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk income taxes the company s reported effective tax rate was as follows effective basis point fiscal year rate decrease changes in our overall effective tax rate are largely the result of a larger percentage of our income being generated in lower rate international tax jurisdictions 
fiscal year was the first full year of operations from the acquired european franchise companies and foreign currency exchange movements are favorably impacting our mix of international income 
the associated effective tax rate on our international businesses  which are in lower tax jurisdictions  resulted in the improvement in fiscal year and effective tax rates 
absent the nonrecurring income tax benefit recorded in fiscal year  the effective tax rate for that fiscal year would have been percent 

table of contents effects of inflation we compensate some of our salon employees with percentage commissions based on sales they generate  thereby enabling salon payroll expense as a percent of revenues to remain relatively constant 
accordingly  this provides us certain protection against inflationary increases as payroll expense and related benefits our major expense components are variable costs of sales 
in addition  we may increase pricing in our salons to offset any significant increases in wages 
therefore  we do not believe inflation has had a significant impact on the results of operations 
recent accounting pronouncements recent accounting pronouncements are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
constant currency presentation the presentation below demonstrates the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations from year to year 
in fiscal year and  foreign currency translation had a positive impact on consolidated revenues and net income before income taxes due to the strengthening of the canadian dollar  british pound and euro 
to present this information  current period results for entities reporting in currencies other than united states dollars are converted into united states dollars at the average exchange rates in effect during the prior fiscal year  rather than the actual average exchange rates in effect during the current fiscal year

other long term liabilities in the contractual obligations table include a total of million related to a salary deferral program  million related to established contractual payment obligations under retirement and severance payment agreements for a small number of retired employees  million related to the executive profit sharing plan see note and million related to contractual payments required under non compete agreements entered into in conjunction with recent acquisitions 
all amounts exclude amounts deemed to represent interest payments 
this table excludes the short term liabilities  other than the current portion of long term debt  disclosed on our balance sheet as the amounts recorded for these items will be paid in the next year 
we have no unconditional purchase obligations  as defined by fas  disclosure of long term obligations 
also excluded from the contractual obligations table are payment estimates associated with employee health and workers compensation claims for which we are self insured 
the majority of our recorded liability for self insured employee health and workers compensation losses represents estimated reserves for incurred claims that have yet to be filed or settled 
the company has unfunded deferred compensation contracts covering certain management and executive personnel 
the deferred compensation contracts are offered to key executives based on their accomplishments within the company 
because we cannot predict the timing or amount of our future payments related to these contracts  such amounts were not included in the table above 
related obligations totaled and million at june  and  respectively  and are included in other non current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 
refer to note of the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements operating leases primarily represent long term obligations for the rental of salon premises  including leases for company owned salons  as well as franchisee subleases of approximately million  which are funded by franchisees 
regarding the franchisee subleases  we generally retain the right to the related salon assets net of any outstanding obligations in the event of a default by a franchise owner 
management has not experienced and does not expect any material loss to result from these arrangements 
other long term obligations represent our guarantees  primarily entered into prior to december   on a limited number of equipment lease agreements between our franchisees and leasing companies 
if the franchisee should fail to make payments in accordance with the lease  we will be held liable under such agreements and retain the right to possess the related salon operations 
we believe the fair value of the salon operations exceeds the maximum potential amount of future lease payments for which we could be held liable 
the existing guaranteed lease obligations  which have an aggregate undiscounted value of million at june   terminate at various dates between june and april the company has not experienced and does not expect any material loss to result from these arrangements 
in certain franchise area development agreements  a buyback program was included allowing the franchisee to require us to purchase all of their salon assets within a specified market for percent of their original cost within two years from the date of the franchisee opening their first salon 
as of june   existing franchise salons were covered by such agreements and the related maximum potential amount of undiscounted future payments was estimated to be approximately million 
this potential obligation is not included in the table above as the opportunity or the timing of the potential expenditures cannot be reasonably estimated 
we have not and do not expect to incur material expenditures under the buyback program as the program has been discontinued with respect to any new franchise area development agreements and most franchisees who were offered the program in the past choose to continue operating the salons themselves 
further  in the case of a franchisee initiating the buyback program  we anticipate finding another franchisee to purchase the salons directly rather than purchasing them ourselves 
we have interest rate swap contracts  as well as a cross currency swap to hedge a portion of our net investment in foreign operations 
see item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  for a detailed discussion of our derivative instruments 
we do not have other unconditional purchase obligations  or significant other commercial commitments such as commitments under lines of credit  standby letters of credit and standby repurchase obligations or other commercial commitments 
we are in compliance with all covenants and other requirements of our credit agreements and senior notes 
additionally  the credit agreements do not include rating triggers or subjective clauses that would accelerate maturity dates 
as a part of our salon development program  we continue to negotiate and enter into leases and commitments for the acquisition of equipment and leasehold improvements related to future salon locations  and continue to enter into transactions to acquire established hair care salons and businesses 
we do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities spes  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet financial arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes at june  as such  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
financing financing activities are discussed on page and in note to the consolidated financial statements  and derivative activities are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements and item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk management believes that cash generated from operations and amounts available under existing debt facilities will be sufficient to fund its anticipated capital expenditures  acquisitions and required debt repayments for the foreseeable future 
as of june   we have an unused committed line of credit amount of million under our existing revolving credit facility 

table of contents dividends we paid dividends of per share during fiscal year and per share during fiscal years and on august   the board of directors of the company declared a per share quarterly dividend payable september  to shareholders of record on september  share repurchase program in may  our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program under which up to million could be expended for the repurchase of regis corporation common stock 
on august   the board of directors elected to increase the maximum repurchase amount to million 
the timing and amounts of any repurchases will depend on many factors  including the market price of the common stock and overall market conditions 
the repurchases to date have been made primarily to eliminate the dilutive effect of shares issued in conjunction with acquisitions and stock option exercises 
as of june   a total of million shares have been repurchased for million  including million during fiscal year all repurchased shares are immediately retired 
this repurchase program has no stated expiration date 
risk factors impact of acquisition and real estate availablity the key driver of our revenue and earnings growth is the number of salons we acquire or construct 
while we believe that substantial future acquisition and organic growth opportunities exist  any material decrease in the number of such opportunities would have an impact on our revenue and earnings growth 
impact of the economic environment changes to the united states  canadian  united kingdom and other european economies have an impact on our business 
visitation patterns to our salons can be adversely impacted by changes in unemployment rates and discretionary income levels 
impact of key relationships we maintain key relationships with certain companies 
termination of these relationships could have an adverse impact on our ability to grow or future operating results 
impact of fashion changes in consumer tastes and fashion trends can have an impact on our financial performance 
impact of changes in regulatory and statutory laws with more than  locations and  employees world wide  our financial results can be adversely impacted by regulatory or statutory changes in laws 
impact of competition competition on a market by market basis remains strong 
therefore  our ability to raise prices in certain markets can be adversely impacted by this competition 
impact of changes in manufacturers choice of distribution channels the retail products that we sell are licensed to be carried exclusively by professional salons 
should the various product manufacturers decide to utilize other distribution channels  such as large discount retailers  it could negatively impact the revenue earned from product sales 

table of contents impact of changes to interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates changes in interest rates will have an impact on our expected results from operations 
currently  we manage the risk related to fluctuations in interest rates through the use of floating rate debt instruments and other financial instruments 
see discussion in item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  for additional information 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates will have an impact on our reported results from operations 
the majority of the revenue and costs associated with the performance of our foreign operations are denominated in local currencies such as the canadian dollar  euro and british pound 
therefore  we do not have significant foreign currency transaction risk  however  the translation at different exchange rates from period to period may impact the amount of reported income from our international operations 
for the year ended june   operations denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar represented approximately percent of consolidated net income before income taxes  and changes in foreign currency exchange rates benefited net income before income taxes by approximately million 
this impact was calculated by multiplying current year net income before income taxes in local currencies by the change in the average foreign currency exchange rate between the current fiscal year and the prior fiscal year 
refer the constant currency discussion on page for further detail 
impact of seasonality our business is not subject to substantial seasonal variations in demand 
however  the timing of easter may cause a quarterly variation in the third and fourth quarters 
historically  our revenue and net earnings have generally been realized evenly throughout the fiscal year 
the service and retail product revenues associated with our corporate salons  as well as our franchise revenues  are of a replenishment nature 
we estimate that customer visitation patterns are generally consistent throughout the year 
impact of changes in securities laws and regulations the sarbanes oxley act of that became law in july requires changes in some of our corporate governance and securities disclosure or compliance practices 
we are presently preparing for our required compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of  and management s assertions concerning financial reporting controls 
while we believe that we can ultimately comply with the new legislated requirements associated with being a registrant with the securities and exchange commission  this process is costly and presents both challenge and risk 
the sarbanes oxley act of also requires the sec to promulgate new rules on a variety of subjects  in addition to rule proposals already made  and the new york stock exchange has approved revisions to its requirements for listed companies 
we expect these developments to increase our compliance costs 
these developments could possibly make it more difficult and more expensive to obtain director and officer liability insurance  and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage 
these developments could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors  or qualified executive officers 
we are presently evaluating and monitoring regulatory developments and cannot estimate the timing or magnitude of additional costs which may be incurred as a result
