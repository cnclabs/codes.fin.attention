the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and torchmark s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
results of operations how torchmark views its operations torchmark consists of a group of life insurance companies which market primarily individual life and supplemental health insurance and annuities to a limited extent throughout the united states 
as a group of insurance carriers  torchmark collects premium as revenue from policyholders for the eventual payment of policyholder benefits 
as part of its insurance operations  torchmark pays policy benefits  incurs operating expenses  including policy acquisition costs  administrative expenses  and taxes 
life and health insurance contracts can be long term 
therefore  premium receipts in excess of current expenses are invested 
the resulting investment income is a component of revenue 
torchmark s investment activities focus on seeking quality investments to provide an appropriate yield to support its insurance products 
torchmark does not engage in trading investments for profit  and generally holds investments over long periods 
torchmark considers its core operations to be its insurance operations and the associated investment activities to provide a yield to support those products 
while realized gains and losses do occur from time to time  they are not considered in the determination of insurance premium pricing or product profitability 
these periodic gains or losses can be material in relation to core results  however  having a considerable positive or negative impact on torchmark s net income 
therefore  torchmark management does not consider realized gains and losses from portfolio management to be part of ongoing investment operations 
please refer to the discussion of realized gains and losses in this report 
torchmark s management views its operations in accordance with the manner in which its business is segmented 
as fully described in note business segments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  torchmark s core operations are divided into two major categories  insurance underwriting and investments 
insurance underwriting operations are segmented according to general product type life insurance  health insurance  annuity  and other 
managers of the insurance segments are responsible for marketing  underwriting  and administering their respective insurance products 
management s measure of profitability for the insurance segments is insurance underwriting income before other income and insurance administrative expenses 
insurance underwriting income represents the profit margin on insurance products before administrative expenses  and is calculated by deducting net policy obligations  commissions  and acquisition expenses from premium revenue 
the investment segment s management is responsible for torchmark s investments  debt  and cash flow 
management s measure of profitability for the investment segment is excess investment income  which is the income earned on the investment portfolio less the interest credited to net policy liabilities and financing costs associated with torchmark s debt and preferred securities 
other income and the unallocated insurance administrative expenses are classified in a separate other insurance segment 
torchmark further views its insurance segment operations by the marketing group  either direct response  independent  or captive career agencies  which distributes the products of that segment 
profitability of these marketing groups is also measured in the same manner as the overall segment is measured 
insurance underwriting income and excess investment income are highly useful to management in evaluating the performance of the segments and the underlying marketing groups within each insurance segment  because each of torchmark s distribution units tend to operate in a niche market offering insurance products designed for that niche 
these measures enable management to view period to period trends  and make informed decisions regarding future courses of action by segment  distribution unit  and niche product 
the tables in note business segments demonstrate the measures of profitability 
those tables also reconcile torchmark s revenues and expenses by segment to its major income statement line items for each of the years in the three year period ending december  additionally  this note provides a summary of the profitability measures that demonstrates year to year comparability and which reconciles to torchmark s net income 
that summary is reproduced below from the consolidated financial statements to present torchmark s overall operations in the manner that management uses to manage the business

torchmark s operations on a segment by segment basis are discussed in depth under the appropriate captions following in this report 
summary of operations torchmark s net income increased million to million in  and net income increased million to million in the growth in earnings came primarily from the life insurance and investment segments 
the life insurance segment added million to the increase in earnings  and million in pretax earnings growth 
life insurance growth has been a result of increases in sales volumes  premium and improvements in margins in both and  and is discussed further under the caption life insurance 
health premium income rose just in each of the years and pretax health profits declined by million to million in and million in premium growth has been limited because of health sales declines in and  while the high loss ratios on a closed block of cancer business contributed to the lower pretax health profits 
see the discussion under health insurance for a more detailed discussion of health insurance results 
the annuity segment profits have been adversely affected by replacement activity of torchmark s policies by a former distributor 
torchmark has previously stated that it will offer annuities  but does not plan to emphasize annuity products  favoring life insurance instead 
see the caption annuities for further discussion 
the investment segment s profitability increased million on a pretax basis in and million on a pretax basis in the investment segment  which includes net investment income offset by financing costs  has benefited from the lower interest rates on financing costs and a greater benefit from the interest rate swaps on torchmark s debt 
see the analysis of excess investment income under the caption investments for a more detailed discussion 
included in net income were after tax realized investment losses which can fluctuate greatly from period to period 
in  they were million compared with million in and thousand in therefore  the realized investment losses resulted in an after tax decline in net income of million but an increase in net income of million 
realized losses in were primarily caused by writedowns of fixed maturities due to deterioration in credit quality of certain investments 
realized investment gains and losses are fully discussed under the caption realized gains and losses in this report 
total revenues rose in to billion 
in  total revenues increased to billion from billion in the change in pretax realized investment losses accounted for of the increase but offset of the increase 
the life premium increase was the primary contributor to revenue growth in both periods  adding to revenue growth each year 
net investment income added of the growth in each period  but the decline in annuity premium reduced revenues by 
torchmark views the benefit of the reduced interest cost resulting from the swap of its fixed rate interest obligations to variable rates as a reduction in interest costs 
in addition to the beneficial impact on earnings from this interest cost differential  gaap rules also require that all derivatives including torchmark s swaps must be valued at market value with period to period changes reflected in earnings 
in accordance with gaap  these changes in value are treated as realized gains and losses 
in  the securities and exchange commission informally interpreted the gaap rules affecting the reporting of torchmark s swap instruments stating that all income and expenses related to non hedged derivatives must be reported in the same line item as the required fair value adjustment 
for this reason  torchmark reports the interest expense reduction in its consolidated statements of operations as a realized investment gain  not as a reduction in interest expense 
torchmark continues to report this interest savings as a reduction in interest cost in its segment analysis and in management s discussion  as this is the way torchmark manages its investment segment 
in through  a number of significant  unusual  and nonrecurring items affected torchmark s net income 
torchmark management does not view these items as components of its core operating results because they are not indicative of past performance or future prospects of the insurance operations 
a discussion of these items follows 
in  net income was impacted by two nonrecurring items 
first  torchmark sold an airplane and recognized a pretax loss of 
million 
in the consolidated statements of operations  this item was included as an administrative expense 
secondly  the settlement of a tax issue resulted in interest due torchmark in the pretax amount of million 
this item was included in investment income on the consolidated statements of operations 
because the tax issue covered a period of many years  the interest income on the tax refund exceeded the refund itself 
after costs  the effect of the tax refund on earnings was immaterial 
significant gains or losses from non investment property or significant interest income from non investment sources is highly unusual for torchmark 
the charge related to previously discontinued energy operations arose from litigation which was ongoing at the time of torchmark s divestiture of energy activities in this litigation was settled during  resulting in the charge 
also in  torchmark adopted a new accounting standard concerning the way asset backed securities are to be accounted for and set forth new rules regarding their impairment 
in accordance with this rule  torchmark determined that certain of these assets were impaired  and an after tax impairment charge in the amount of million was taken upon adoption of this standard as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
please see note change in accounting principle in the consolidated financial statements for more detail on this item 
as of december   torchmark held million at market value million at book value of the securities subject to this standard 
effective january   torchmark adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
this statement prohibits goodwill amortization after  and does not allow the restatement of prior periods for comparability when goodwill has been amortized 
instead  after adoption  companies are required to consider goodwill for impairment under a set of guidelines described in the statement 
torchmark tested its goodwill in accordance with the provisions of sfas in both and and determined that goodwill was not impaired 
therefore  torchmark s unamortized goodwill balance at december   in the amount of million  was unchanged in and in order to compare the performance in with and  the effect of goodwill amortization in the amount of million in must be removed from consideration 
see note significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information 
life insurance 
life insurance is torchmark s largest and fastest growing insurance segment 
in  life premium represented of total premium  compared with in and in life underwriting income before other income and administrative expense represented of the total in  up from in and in life insurance premium rose in to billion and in to billion 
life insurance products are marketed through several distribution channels 
premium by channel for each of the last three years is as follows 
life insurance premium by distribution method dollar amounts in thousands amount of total amount of total amount of total direct response    american income exclusive agency   liberty national exclusive agency   military agency    other agencies    torchmark historically reports its in force  active policies and sales issued of insurance policies in terms of annualized premium  a statistical measure representing the amount of annual premium prospectively collectible for any policy 
in force policies at the end of a reporting period means all the company s active policies as of the date regardless of when they were issued 
annualized premium in force means the amount of prospectively collectible annual premium for all active policies 
for policies issued during a period  annualized premium issued means the amount of prospectively collectible annual premiums for those policies 
annualized premium is a standard measure used widely in the life insurance industry 
the following table sets forth annualized life insurance premium issued and in force information for each of the last three years by distribution method 
life insurance annualized premium data by distribution method dollar amounts in thousands annualized premium issued for the year annualized premium in force at december  direct response      american income exclusive agency    liberty national exclusive agency    military agency      other agencies      beginning with this report  torchmark also presents first year collected premium  which is premium that was collected during the reported period on all policies in their first policy year 
torchmark suggests that this new data is useful primarily as it is more predictive of future annual premium revenue than annualized premium issued because this new measure takes into account lapses on newly issued policies at the time when most lapses occur 
the table below discloses first year collected life premium by distribution channel 
life insurance first year collected premium by distribution method dollar amounts in thousands amount of total amount of total amount of total direct response liberty national exclusive agency american income exclusive agency military agency other agencies the direct response group is torchmark s leading writer of life insurance 
direct response marketing is conducted primarily through direct mail  but also through co op mailings  television and consumer magazine advertising  and direct mail solicitations endorsed by groups  unions and associations 
direct response markets a line of life products primarily to juveniles  their parents  and other adults over age the direct response operation accounted for almost of torchmark s life insurance premium during direct response life premium rose in and in at december   direct response life annualized premium in force was million  which represented of torchmark s total  the largest of any distribution group 
direct response life insurance annualized premium in force rose in after growing in growth in premium income and annualized premium in force resulted from strong sales of direct response products in each period  as evidenced by the increases in first year collections of in and in and annualized premium issued growth of in and in the growth in sales is largely attributable to this group s focus on its juvenile life product 
this product was sold for many years as a modified premium term product 
sales of this product historically resulted in an average face amount of about  with an average annual premium of in recent years  rising acquisition costs restricted margins and limited marketing expansion 
after testing a variety of other replacement products and pricing that would result in more favorable results  direct response began marketing in mid a simple whole life product with an average face amount of  and an average annual premium of the higher annual premium has allowed direct response to reenter some juvenile markets that had previously become unprofitable with the old product 
not only is the juvenile market an important source of sales  but it also is a vehicle to reach the parents and grandparents of the juvenile insureds 
parents and grandparents are more likely to respond favorably to a solicitation by direct response for life coverage on themselves than is the general adult population 
also  both the juveniles and their parents are low acquisition cost targets for sales of additional coverage over time 
given the success of the change in product offering to the juvenile market and their parents  sales to this demographic group should continue as one of direct response s premier markets 
the american income exclusive agency focuses on members of labor unions  credit unions  and other associations for its life insurance sales 
it is a high profit margin business characterized by lower policy obligation ratios 
this agency was torchmark s fastest growing life insurance agency during both and in terms of premium income and annualized premium in force 
annualized life premium in force rose to million at year end  after having increased in  while premium income rose in and in sales for this agency rose in after having increased in first year collected premium grew in and in the rapid growth in sales for this agency over the last three years was a result of the growth in the number of its agents 
since year end  the agent count has grown from  agents to  agents by year end  a compounded annual growth rate of 
as in the case of all of torchmark s agency distribution systems  continued increases in sales are largely dependent on increases in agent count 
american income s marketing organization continues to implement efforts to improve agent recruiting  retention  and productivity in order to increase the size of this agency 
the liberty national exclusive agency distribution system markets primarily to middle income markets in several southeastern states 
liberty s life premium rose in to million  representing of torchmark s total life premium 
in  life premium grew over the prior year 
the annualized life premium in force at the liberty agency was million at december   representing of torchmark s total life annualized premium in force 
annualized life premium in force rose in each of the last two years 
life premium sales for this agency  in terms of annualized premium issued  declined during to million  compared with growth of in the decline in sales resulted primarily from a new procedure adopted in april  whereby agents no longer accept the initial premium in the form of cash  a type of business prone to higher lapse rates 
instead  customers are required to pay the initial premium with a check 
management believes that the lower life insurance sales from this change in procedure will be temporary  and that over time  the new procedure is expected to result in sales of life policies that are more persistent  resulting in higher margins 
the cash with application sales comprised of life sales at the time this procedure was changed 
therefore  excluding these cash with application sales  issued premium would have increased in the positive effect of this change is a factor in the increase of in first year collected premium in  compared with no change in liberty s total agent count at year end was essentially flat with the prior year at  however  the count of renewal agents  those agents that have been with liberty for more than one year  declined to at year end renewal agents are generally higher producers than first year agents 
in the latter part of  liberty restructured its bonus system to not only reward production  but also to encourage recruiting and retention of productive agents 
management believes that the continued recruiting of new agents and the retention of productive agents are critical to the continued growth of sales in controlled agency distribution systems 
torchmark s military agency consists of a nationwide independent agency whose sales force is comprised of former commissioned and noncommissioned military officers who sell exclusively to commissioned and noncommissioned military officers and their families 
this business consists of whole life products with term insurance riders and is characterized by low lapse rates 
the military agency has steadily grown 
in  military agency life premium was million or of torchmark s total life premium 
premium rose in and in growth in this agency continues to accelerate as annualized premium in force rose in to million after an increase in of 
one key to the growth of premium income and premium in force in the military agency is the high persistency associated with military business  as lapses are very low and most premium sold is retained 
sales of this agency grew in terms of annualized premium issued in to million  after an increase in first year collections were million in  increasing in and in torchmark s other life insurance distribution systems consist of the united investors agency  the united american independent and branch office agencies  and other small miscellaneous sales agencies 
the united investors agency is comprised of several independent agencies  but prior to  united investors distribution was primarily through the sales representatives of a former torchmark subsidiary  waddell reed 
torchmark spun off waddell reed in  and united investors terminated the waddell reed agency contract in the loss of the waddell reed sales group has had a negative impact on production in the united investors agency 
the united american independent and branch office agencies combined represented approximately of other agency premium in  or of the torchmark total 
life premium for these agencies has been relatively flat for the past three years  because these two agencies focus on health insurance  with life sales being incidental 
in addition to life insurance sales  the united investors distribution system has also engaged in the sale of variable life products 
variable life products are considered deposit type products under gaap 
therefore  premium collections on these products are accounted for as deposits and are added to a customer s account known as a separate account liability 
a discussion of the accounting for variable products and how torchmark manages this business is presented in this report under the caption annuities because variable life products are very similar to variable annuities 
although variable life collections are not included in premium in force data  they are included in the variable life account balance 
indirectly  they add to premium revenue through charges to the variable life account balance for insurance coverage and administration 
the account balance is affected by fluctuations in financial markets  particularly equity markets 
because equity markets were weak in and  the variable life account balance was negatively impacted in those periods 
however  in  a rebound in markets had a favorable impact on the account balance 
at december   the variable life account balance was million  increasing over the prior year balance of million 
the following table summarizes selected variable life insurance information 
selected variable life data dollar amounts in thousands variable life collections during the year variable life deposit balance at year end life insurance summary of results dollar amounts in thousands amount of premium amount of premium amount of premium premium and policy charges   policy obligations   required interest on reserves   net policy obligations commissions and premium taxes   amortization of acquisition costs   required interest on deferred acquisition costs total expense insurance underwriting margin before other income and administrative expenses gross margins  as indicated by insurance underwriting margin before other income and administrative expense  rose in and in over the respective prior year 
as a percentage of life insurance premium  gross margins have remained fairly stable  with a slight improvement in improvement in life margins should continue as the percentage of american income premium to total premium continues to grow  because that agency s margins are torchmark s highest 
also  direct response margins have increased from to in  as it has emphasized sales of its juvenile policy  a higher margin product 
health insurance 
torchmark markets its supplemental health insurance products through a number of distribution channels 
the following table indicates health insurance premium income by distribution channel for each of the last three years 
health insurance premium by distribution method dollar amounts in thousands amount of total amount of total amount of total united american independent agency   united american branch office agency   liberty national exclusive agency   american income exclusive agency   direct response    the following table presents annualized health premium issued and in force by distribution method for the last three years

health insurance annualized premium in force by product dollar amounts in thousands december  amount of total amount of total amount of total medicare supplement    cancer    other limited benefit plans   total at december   medicare supplement accounted for of torchmark s annualized health premium in force 
the medicare supplement market has become more difficult in recent periods due to regulatory pressures and increased competition  resulting in declines in sales and premium in force for this product 
while medicare supplement still remains torchmark s dominant product in terms of annualized premium  hospital surgical products have been growing rapidly in their contribution to health premium 
this product line has risen from of annualized health premium in force in to in growth in this line has more than offset the declines in medicare supplement premium in force in medicare supplement annualized premium issued fell in to million from million in in  medicare supplement sales were down from million the prior year 
the primary factor in the declining sales has been price competition 
in recent periods  medicare supplement sales faced increased premium rate pressure from competition in some markets 
torchmark implemented premium rate increases on its medicare supplement policies earlier than some competitors in order to maintain the level of underwriting margins 
in  torchmark was able to seek lower rate increases than obtained in recent years 
management believes that competitive pressures will subside as competitors obtain necessary rate increases 
in addition to the increased competition  the number of producing agents at the united american branch office agency declined in to  agents and further declined in to  agents at december  these declines in counts occurred as agents in some markets left for easier sales for those competitors whose medicare supplement products were priced lower than torchmark s  negatively impacting torchmark s medicare supplement sales 
in  this trend reversed and the united american branch office agency s count grew to  producing agents  as the focus of this agency was expanded to other supplemental health products discussed below which have experienced increased demand 
medicare supplement policies are highly regulated at both the federal and state levels with standardized benefit plans  limits on first year agent compensation  and mandated minimum loss ratios 
other regulatory issues continue to affect the medicare supplement market 
medical cost inflation and changes to the medicare program necessitate annual rate increases  which generally require state insurance department approval 
the medicare program is constantly being studied and reviewed by congress and the executive branch  with changes in the program expected from time to time 
however  medicare supplements remain a popular supplemental health policy with the country s large and growing group of medicare beneficiaries 
about of all medicare beneficiaries have medicare supplements to cover at least some portion of the deductibles and coinsurance that the federal medicare program does not pay 
because of minimum loss ratio regulation  underwriting margins on medicare supplements are lower than those on torchmark s life business 
however  due to united american s low cost  service oriented customer assistance and claims administration  as well as its economies of scale  it is a profitable line of business 
in  congress passed legislation that in will provide medicare covered prescription drugs  a benefit not previously covered by medicare 
while this is a major addition to the medicare program  it will have little effect on torchmark s medicare supplement business because the legislation does not require medicare supplements to cover the co pays and deductibles that the medicare drug program does not cover 
in the past  torchmark did not write any medicare supplement plans that provided prescription drug coverage 
at this time  it appears that there will continue to be an important role for private insurers such as torchmark in helping senior citizens cover their healthcare costs 
as a result  medicare supplements should continue as a popular product for senior age consumers 
sales of other limited benefit health products  in terms of annualized premium issued  rose in to million over million in in  sales more than doubled 
annualized premium in force for other health products grew in to million  after rising in to million 
both of the united american agencies offer these limited benefit plans 
most of the plans being written are limited benefit hospital and surgical plans that are lower cost alternatives to individual major medical plans  or that are bought to supplement employer sponsored group health plans 
increased consumer demand for these plans is the result of the growing unavailability of individual major medical plans and decreased coverage offered by employers 
because of the limits on maximum benefits and other limits  these type plans are less subject to high rate increases that have been experienced in major medical type plans 
from a regulatory standpoint  these plans generally require lower minimum loss ratios and have higher margins than medicare supplements  but they do experience slightly higher lapse rates 
cancer business is primarily produced by the liberty national agency 
cancer annualized premium in force represented of torchmark s total health premium in force at december  annualized premium in force rose in and in approximately million of the total million of the cancer annualized premium in force consists of a closed block of cancer business which arose from a class action settlement in the mid nineties 
cancer sales  in terms of annualized premium issued  were million in  above million sold in sales in increased over the prior year 
health insurance summary of results dollar amounts in thousands amount of premium amount of premium amount of premium premium    policy obligations   required interest on reserves   net policy obligations   commissions and premium taxes   amortization of acquisition costs   required interest on deferred acquisition costs total expense insurance underwriting margin before other income and administrative expenses health insurance underwriting margin before other income and administrative expense declined in from million to million 
in  health underwriting income declined from million in as a percentage of premium  underwriting income before other income and administrative expense declined in each year from their respective prior years 
the decreases in margins were caused primarily by increased policy obligations in the previously mentioned closed block of cancer policies as loss ratios on this block continue to exceed 
these increases in claims cost on this block resulted from additional benefits required in the class action settlements 
annuities 
annuity products are marketed by torchmark subsidiaries to service a variety of needs  including retirement income and long term  tax deferred growth opportunities 
annuities are sold on both a fixed and variable basis 
torchmark measures the monetary volume of its inventory of annuity products and annuity sales on the basis of deposit balance and collections  respectively 
annuity collections are the deposits or annuity premium received from a customer  either as a new sale or as an addition to an existing deposit balance 
collections measure annuity growth through new deposits 
collections are not accounted for as revenue but are added to the deposit balance 
the deposit balance is the liability due to customers for torchmark s annuities and is a measure of the size of the annuity inventory upon which annuity revenue is based 
the variable annuity deposit balance is included in separate account liabilities on torchmark s consolidated balance sheet 
the fixed annuity balance is a component of torchmark s future policy benefits 
the deposit balance is increased by collections and interest credits  but is reduced by withdrawals and by the policy charge assessments that are revenue to torchmark 
the variable account balance is additionally increased or decreased by market growth or declines in the investments in the underlying funds 
fixed annuity deposits are held and invested by torchmark and are obligations of the company 
variable annuity deposits are invested at the policyholder s direction into his choice among a variety of mutual funds  which vary in degree of investment risk and return 
a fixed annuity investment account is also available as a variable annuity investment option 
investments pertaining to variable annuity deposits are reported as separate account assets  and are equal to separate account liabilities 
revenues on both fixed and variable annuities are derived from charges to the annuity account balances for insurance risk  administration  and surrender  depending on the structure of the contract 
variable accounts are also charged an investment fee and a sales charge 
torchmark benefits to the extent these policy charges exceed actual costs and  on fixed annuity policies  to the extent actual investment income exceeds the investment income which is credited to the policy 
prior to the second quarter of  torchmark s annuities were sold primarily by the waddell reed sales force  which marketed united investors products under a marketing agreement 
effective april   torchmark terminated the marketing agreement providing for the sale of torchmark s variable annuities by the waddell reed sales force due to a dispute over compensation due and waddell reed s replacement of united investors variable annuities with those of another carrier 
waddell reed was a former subsidiary of torchmark which was spun off in in addition to no longer marketing united investors products  waddell reed has continued replacing united investors products with those of another carrier since the termination of the agreement 
as a result  torchmark has experienced declines in annuity sales and deposit balances 
subsequently  united investors and waddell reed have engaged in litigation regarding the compensation dispute and waddell s replacement of the united investors variable annuities 
this litigation has been discussed in detail in prior years forms k and q as well as in item legal proceedings 
united investors now markets variable annuities through other broker dealers 
in addition  a small amount of fixed annuities are sold by the united american independent agency and the liberty national agency 
while torchmark continues to sell annuity products  it does not expect to emphasize this product line in the future 
the following table presents the annuity account balance at each year end and the annuity collections for each year for both fixed and variable annuities 
annuity deposit balances dollar amounts in millions annuity collections dollar amounts in thousands fixed    variable      total fixed annuity premium collections more than doubled in and almost doubled in the fixed annuity deposit balance rose in and in  reversing an decline in the strong growth in the fixed annuity deposits and account balance in resulted in large part from production by a united american general agency through arrangements with banks 
additionally  many united investors policyholders transferred funds from variable annuities to fixed products in both and management believes that the poor market conditions in the past three years are a major factor in the transfers to the lower risk fixed products 
variable annuity collections have declined steadily since the sales agreement with waddell reed was terminated 
the loss of the waddell reed sales force  the replacement activity by waddell reed  and the transfers of variable accounts to fixed products have all been major factors in the declines in variable annuity sales and the variable annuity deposit balance in the years through weaker financial markets also caused the declines in the years of and  and in early the increases in equity markets during most of offset the earlier decline in account value in variable accounts are valued based on the market values of the underlying securities

underwriting income as a percentage of policy charges was in  consistent with in the higher ratio in resulted primarily from the additional surrender charges in that year 
administrative expenses 
torchmark s operating expenses are classified in two categories insurance administrative expenses and expenses of the parent company 
consider the following information for the three years ended december  operating expenses selected information dollar amounts in thousands insurance administrative expenses parent company expense total operating expenses insurance administrative expenses increase over prior year expense as percentage of premium total operating expenses increase over prior year expense as percentage of revenue insurance administrative expenses exclude thousand nonrecurring loss on sale of aircraft equipment in revenues include realized losses of million in  million in  and million in revenues in also include a nonrecurring interest income benefit of million related to a tax settlement 
because realized gains and losses and nonrecurring items bear no relationship to core operations  torchmark management removes the effect of these items from revenue when evaluating expense ratios 
insurance administrative expenses as a percentage of premium and total operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue have held steady throughout the period considered 
increases in were mainly a result of an increase in pension expense of million and slightly higher litigation expense 
investments

it is the measure that management uses to evaluate the performance of the investment segment as described in note business segments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
it is defined as net investment income on a tax equivalent basis reduced by the interest credited to net policy liabilities and the interest cost associated with capital funding or financing costs 
tax equivalent investment income includes an adjustment to the yield on tax exempt securities to produce a yield equivalent to the pretax yield on taxable securities 
tax equivalent investment income is useful because it places all fixed maturities on a comparable yield basis  regardless of tax treatment 
excess investment income per diluted share is the measure used by management to evaluate the performance of the investment segment 
this segment is responsible for the management of capital resources including investments  debt and cash flow 
since  torchmark has used over billion of cash flow to repurchase torchmark shares under its ongoing share repurchase program after determining that the repurchases provided a greater return than other investment alternatives 
share repurchases reduce excess investment income because of the foregone earnings on the cash that would otherwise have been invested in interest bearing assets  but they also reduce the number of shares outstanding 
in order to put all capital resource uses on a comparable basis  management believes that excess investment income per diluted share is the best measure of the investment segment 
net investment income rose to million in and to million in included in investment income was a nonrecurring interest income item resulting from a tax settlement of million pretax 
on a tax equivalent basis  as management views investment income  investment income also rose in and in the increases in and were caused by the growth in mean invested assets at book value  which were billion in  compared with billion in and billion in the impact of the growth in assets in on investment income was partially offset by lower yields available on new investments 
the growth in mean invested assets was achieved in and even though million and million  respectively  were used to buy back torchmark stock under its ongoing share repurchase program each year 
growth in average invested assets has resulted from the investment of new cash flow into taxable fixed maturity securities in both and these securities consisted primarily of investment grade corporate bonds and trust preferred securities

as discussed under the caption annuities  the growth in net policy liabilities was primarily due to the annuity production from a new united american general agency and the transfers from united investor variable policies to fixed annuities due to the deteriorating equity markets 
the lower average crediting rate resulted from reductions made by the company in response to the low interest rate environment 
the increase in interest credited in resulted from a reduction in the average crediting rate from to  offsetting the increase in average liabilities 
financing costs for the investment segment primarily consist of interest on torchmark s various debt instruments and are deducted from excess investment income

the table below presents the components of financing costs 
analysis of financing costs amounts in thousands interest on funded debt preferred securities distributions interest on short term debt other subtotal of interest expense benefit from interest rate swaps financing costs financing costs have declined significantly during the past two years  falling in and an additional in the decline in short term interest rates over the past two years has been a significant factor in the decline in financing costs for two reasons 
first  it has reduced short term borrowing costs in each period 
secondly  it has favorably impacted the benefit of torchmark s three interest rate swaps of fixed rate interest obligations to floating rates 
a full description of these swaps is disclosed in note debt in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
financing costs have also benefitted from torchmark s restructuring of its debt in  redeeming the monthly income preferred securities for lower fixed rate debt 
the issuance and redemption of torchmark s debt instruments are disclosed in note debt and are further discussed under the caption capital resources in this report 
excess investment income rose in to million 
it increased in and in excess investment income per diluted share increased in to per share from per share 
it increased in and in the growth in excess investment income in both and resulted from the increased investment income due to the growth in the portfolio and the reductions in financing costs caused by the lower interest rate environment in both years 
additionally  share purchases have caused excess investment income per share to grow faster than excess investment income as the effect of the foregone interest income on funds used for the repurchase was more than offset by the reduced number of diluted shares outstanding 
torchmark acquired million shares in at a cost of million and million shares in at a cost of million 
torchmark s investment strategy is to maintain a positive spread between yields on new investments and the company s required yield on policy and financing costs 
it is this positive spread that results in excess investment income 
at the same time  torchmark desires to invest predominately in investment grade quality corporate fixed maturities 
in prolonged periods of low interest rates  maintaining sufficient spread while limiting new investments to high quality becomes more challenging 
because torchmark s policy liabilities are very long term in nature with fixed rates  a low rate environment must exist for a considerable period of time before any meaningful negative impact will be made on the spread 
nevertheless  torchmark has addressed this issue in the recent periods of declining rates by lengthening maturities of new investment purchases and revising the crediting rates on various products 
the chart below presents selected information about torchmark s fixed maturity acquisitions in the years through investment grade corporate securities include both bonds and trust preferred securities classified as redeemable preferred stocks with a diversity of issuers and industry sectors 
both yield and average life calculations on new purchases on noncallable bonds are based on the maturity date 
in the case of callable bonds  the average life is based on the call date or maturity date  whichever produces the lowest yield yield to worst 
fixed maturity acquisitions selected information dollar amounts in millions for the year cost of acquisitions investment grade corporate securities other investment grade securities below investment grade securities total fixed maturity acquisitions average yield effective annual yield average life in years  to worst call tax equivalent basis as rates have declined in recent periods  torchmark has maintained yield on new investments by lengthening maturities 
management believes that the long term  fixed rate characteristics of its policy liabilities do not result in negative asset and liability matching 
in years prior to  torchmark was able to maintain yields in excess of on new acquisitions of investment grade bonds 
in  however  yields at this level were unavailable for investment grade bonds due to the lower rate environment 
as a result  new money was invested at an average effective yield of in while the lower yields available to torchmark reduce investment income  the impact of the lower rates on excess investment income and total net income is expected to be immaterial in the near term 
this is because torchmark has been able to reduce the crediting rates on the majority of its interest sensitive and annuity products  offsetting a large portion of the reduction in income 
additionally  the lower interest rate environment reduces the cost of torchmark s commercial paper borrowings and enhances the benefits from its interest rate swaps  further reducing financing costs and minimizing the impact of lower investment rates on income 
management believes its strategy to maintain yields has been effective  as evidenced by the increases in excess investment income as a percentage of tax equivalent investment income even in periods of very low interest rates 
management also believes that torchmark will benefit as rates eventually rebound 
funds generated annually from insurance operations as well as those from the investment portfolio exceed the total of floating rate liabilities  and reinvestment at higher rates should result in a positive benefit to excess investment income 
torchmark s emphasis has been on bond investments over investments in equities  mortgages  or real estate 
therefore  the relative percentage of torchmark s investments by type continues to vary from industry norms 
the following table presents a comparison of torchmark s components of invested assets at amortized cost as of december  with the latest industry data

credit risk sensitivity 
credit risk is the level of certainty that a security s issuer will maintain its ability to honor the terms of that security until maturity 
in recent periods  the securities of many industry sectors affected by the economic downturn have suffered increased credit risk 
as a result  many securities have been downgraded by credit rating agencies to below investment grade status 
thus  the likelihood the issuers will honor their securities terms has been reduced and the securities market values have been impaired 
as torchmark continues to invest in corporate bonds with relatively long maturities  credit risk is a concern 
torchmark mitigates this ongoing risk  in part  by acquiring investment grade bonds  and by investigating the financial fundamentals of each prospective issuer 
at december   approximately of invested assets at fair value were held in fixed maturity securities 
the major rating agencies considered of this portfolio to be investment grade 
the average quality rating of the portfolio continues to be bbb 
the table below demonstrates the credit rankings of torchmark s fixed maturity portfolio at fair value as of december  rating amount in millions aaa aa a  bbb  bb b less than b not rated torchmark s current investment policy is to acquire only investment grade obligations 
thus  increases in below investment grade issues are a result of ratings downgrades of existing holdings 
torchmark reduces credit risk by maintaining investments in a wide range of industry sectors 
the following table presents the industry sectors that exceeded of the corporate fixed maturity portfolio at december  industry depository institutions electric  gas  sanitation services insurance carriers nondepository credit institutions finance communications chemicals allied products transportation equipment food kindred products oil gas extraction petroleum refining related industries industrial  commercial machinery  computer equipment general merchandise stores otherwise  no individual industry represented or more of torchmark s corporate fixed maturities 
market risk sensitivity 
market risk is the risk that the value of a security will change because of a change in market conditions 
torchmark s primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk  which is the risk that a change in a security s value could occur because of a change in interest rates 
this risk is significant to torchmark s investment portfolio because its fixed maturity holdings at amortized cost represent approximately of total investments 
the effects of interest rate fluctuations on fixed investments are reflected on an after tax basis in torchmark s shareholders equity because these investments are marked to market value under sfas the actual interest rate risk to torchmark is reduced because the effect that changes in rates have on assets is offset by the effect they have on insurance liabilities and on debt 
interest assumptions are used to compute the majority of torchmark s insurance liabilities 
these insurance liabilities  net of deferred acquisition costs  were billion and debt was 
billion at december   compared with fixed maturity investments of billion at amortized cost at the same date 
because of the long term nature of insurance liabilities  temporary changes in value caused by rate fluctuations have little bearing on ultimate obligations 
in accordance with gaap  insurance liabilities and debt are generally not marked to market 
market risk is managed in a manner consistent with torchmark s investment objectives 
torchmark seeks to maintain a portfolio of high quality  fixed maturity assets that may be sold in response to changing market conditions 
however  it is torchmark s primary objective to hold securities to maturity 
torchmark s strong operating cash flow and stable  long term policy liabilities decrease the likelihood of needing to sell fixed investments for operating liquidity 
some sales may be made to preserve capital due to changes in credit quality of individual securities or for tax purposes 
potential volatility in the value of torchmark s longer term fixed maturity holdings is reduced by the company s practice of holding securities to maturity  which has resulted in of the fixed portfolio being expected to repay within five years and within ten years 
no derivative instruments are used to manage torchmark s exposure to market risk in the investment portfolio 
interest rate swap instruments have been entered into by torchmark in connection with its preferred stock and certain debt issues as discussed in note debt in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and under the caption capital resources in this report 
the following table illustrates the market risk sensitivity of torchmark s interest rate sensitive fixed maturity portfolio at december  and this table measures the effect of a change in interest rates as represented by the us treasury curve on the fair value of torchmark s fixed maturity portfolio 
the data are prepared through a model which incorporates various assumptions and estimates to measure the change in fair value arising from an immediate and sustained change in interest rates in increments of basis points 
it takes into account the effect that special option features such as call options  put options  and unscheduled repayments could have on the portfolio  given the changes in rates 
the valuation of these option features is dependent upon assumptions about future interest rate volatility that are based on past performance 
market value of fixed maturity portfolio millions change in interest rates in basis points at december  at december  realized gains and losses 
torchmark s core business of providing insurance coverage requires it to maintain an investment portfolio to support its insurance liabilities 
these insurance liabilities are often very long term in nature  with the realization of profits from core insurance operations emerging over many years 
the investments that support these liabilities consist primarily of fixed maturities  with yields expected to provide for the cost of carrying these insurance liabilities 
these expected yields are taken into account when setting insurance premium rates and product profitability expectations 
as a result  fixed maturities are generally held for long periods to support the liabilities  even though they are available for sale at any time 
because torchmark holds a large and diverse investment portfolio  investments are sold or called from time to time  resulting in a realized gain or loss 
these gains and losses occur only incidentally  and are usually the result of sales for tax reasons  deterioration in investment quality of issuers  or calls by the issuers 
torchmark does not engage in trading investments for profit 
therefore  gains or losses which occur in protecting the portfolio or its yield are only secondary to torchmark s core insurance operation of providing insurance coverage to policyholders 
realized gains and losses can be significant in relation to the earnings from core insurance operations  and as a result  have a material positive or negative impact on net income 
they are not considered in determining premium rates or product profitability of torchmark s insurance products  nor are they considered to be part of ongoing investment income 
therefore  they have no bearing on core insurance operations or segment results as management views its operations because such results might not be indicative of the past or future performance of core operations 
for these reasons  torchmark management removes the effects of realized gains and losses when evaluating its overall insurance operating results 
the following table summarizes torchmark s tax effected realized gains losses by component for each of the years in the three year period ended december  analysis of realized gains losses amounts in thousands  except for per share data year ended december  amount per share amount per share amount per share realized gains losses  net of tax  from investment sales writedown of fixed maturities writedown of other investments loss on redemption of debt valuation of interest rate swaps spread on interest rate swaps total the reduction in interest cost from swapping fixed rate obligations to floating rate 
in each year  torchmark wrote down several individual holdings to estimated fair value as a result of other than temporary impairment 
the impaired securities met some or all of torchmark s criteria for other than temporary impairment as discussed in note investments in the consolidated financial statements and in its critical accounting policies in this report 
pretax charges for these impairments were million in  million in  and million in of the seventeen issuers written down in through  the bonds of five issuers were still held at december  at a fair value of million and a book value of million 
accounting rules require torchmark to revalue its interest rate swaps at their fair value at the end of each accounting period 
the fair values of these instruments fluctuate with interest rates in financial markets and diminish with the passage of time so that their value is zero when they expire 
torchmark intends to hold its swaps until they expire 
therefore  while period to period fluctuations can be substantial  the value of the swaps and the cumulative unrealized gains and losses from marking the swaps to market value from inception will be zero when the swap agreements expire 
temporary unrealized changes in swap values are included as a component of realized investment losses on the consolidated statements of operations 
this fair value adjustment for all swaps on a pretax basis was a negative million in  a positive million in  and a positive million in in september   the securities and exchange commission informally interpreted sfas  the gaap rules concerning the reporting of nonhedged derivatives 
their interpretation concluded that all income and expenses related to a non hedged derivative must be recorded in the same line item on the income statement that the adjustment to fair value is recorded 
this interpretation was effective immediately with prior periods reclassified accordingly for comparability 
this interpretation requires cash settlements in interest cost to be combined with the noncash unrealized fair value adjustment as a component of realized investment gains and losses 
torchmark s pretax interest cost reduction from its swap derivatives that was included in realized investment gains was a positive million in  a positive million in  and a positive million in torchmark continues to reduce interest cost for this benefit in its segment analysis as permitted because torchmark views the benefit from lower interest rates as a reduction in its financing costs 
during  torchmark adopted a new accounting principle  recognition of interest income and impairment on purchased and retained beneficial interest in securitized financial assets eitf  which changed the method of accounting for certain of its asset backed securities 
as a result of the requirements of the new principle  torchmark wrote these investments down million  or million net of tax  which has been reported as a change in accounting principle 
subsequent to adoption  impairments of these assets have been and will be reported as realized investment losses 
in  after the adoption of the new rule  an additional impairment loss of million after tax was recorded 
additionally  certain of the asset based securities were sold during both and these sales resulted in proceeds of million at an after tax loss of thousand in  and proceeds of million at an after tax loss of million in at year end  torchmark held million at fair value of asset backed securities subject to the provisions of eitf under the provisions of this standard  these investments were not considered impaired 
for more information on the effects of this accounting rule  see note change in accounting principle in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
financial condition liquidity 
liquidity provides torchmark with the ability to meet on demand the cash commitments required by its business operations and financial obligations 
torchmark s liquidity is derived from three sources positive cash flow from operations  a portfolio of marketable securities  and a line of credit facility 
torchmark s insurance operations have historically generated positive cash flows in excess of its immediate needs 
sources of cash flows from operations include primarily premium and investment income 
cash outflows from operations include policy benefit payments  commissions  administrative expenses  and taxes 
operating cash inflows significantly exceed cash outflows primarily because life insurers  such as torchmark  expect to pay the majority of their policyholder benefits in future periods  sometimes many years later 
a liability is actuarially computed and recorded for these future benefits which increases as insurance in force grows so that torchmark can save for these future payments 
earnings are charged for the increase in this reserve each period  but there is no corresponding cash outlay 
therefore  cash provided from operations will generally significantly exceed net income in any given period 
cash flows are also generated by the maturities and scheduled repayments of torchmark s investment portfolio 
cash flows in excess of immediate requirements are invested to fund future requirements 
available cash flows are also used to repay debt  to buy back torchmark shares  to pay shareholder dividends  and for other corporate uses 
while torchmark s cash flows have historically been positive and very strong  a reduction in cash flow could negatively affect its liquidity 
cash flows provided from operations increased in each of the three years ended december  over their respective prior year 
they were million in  million in  and million in in addition  torchmark received million in investment maturities and repayments in  adding to available cash flows 
such repayments were million in and million in torchmark s cash and short term investments were million at year end and million at year end additionally  torchmark has a portfolio of marketable fixed and equity securities that are available for sale in the event of an unexpected need 
these securities had a fair value of billion at december  torchmark has in place a line of credit facility with a group of lenders which allows unsecured borrowings and stand by letters of credit up to million 
the facility is split into two parts a million day tranche maturing november   and a million five year tranche maturing november  the company has the ability to request up to million in letters of credit to be issued against the million five year tranche 
under either tranche  interest is charged at floating rates 
the line of credit is further designated as a back up credit line for a commercial paper program not to exceed million  whereby torchmark may borrow from either the credit line or issue commercial paper at any time 
commercial paper borrowings and letters of credit on a combined basis may not exceed million 
at december   million carrying amount of commercial paper was outstanding  million letters of credit were issued  and there were no borrowings under the line of credit 
although the commercial paper borrowing balance fluctuates based on torchmark s needs  a facility fee is charged on the entire million facility 
the facility does not contain any ratings based acceleration triggers which would require early repayment 
in accordance with the agreements  torchmark is subject to certain covenants regarding capitalization and earnings 
at december   torchmark was in full compliance with these covenants 
borrowings on this facility are reported as short term debt 
liquidity of the parent company is affected by the ability of the subsidiaries to pay dividends 
the parent receives dividends from subsidiaries in order to meet dividend payments on common and preferred stock  interest and principal repayment requirements on parent company debt  and operating expenses of the parent company 
dividends from insurance subsidiaries of torchmark are limited to the greater of statutory net gain from operations  excluding capital gains and losses  on an annual noncumulative basis  or of surplus  in the absence of special approval 
distributions are not permitted in excess of statutory net worth 
subsidiaries are also subject to certain minimum capital requirements 
although these restrictions exist  dividend availability from subsidiaries historically has substantially exceeded the cash flow needs for parent company operations 
in  subsidiaries of torchmark paid million in dividends to the parent company 
during the year  a maximum amount of million is expected to be available to torchmark from insurance subsidiaries without regulatory approval 
off balance sheet arrangements 
as of december   torchmark had no off balance sheet arrangements  no significant unconsolidated affiliates  no variable interest entities  and no guarantees of the obligations of third party entities 
all of torchmark s guarantees  as disclosed in note commitments and contingencies  were guarantees of the performance of consolidated subsidiaries 
all of torchmark s derivative instruments were recorded at fair value on the balance sheet 
as described under the caption new accounting rules  the financial accounting standards board fasb has issued a revised interpretation of rules concerning consolidation of variable interests finr 
this interpretation will result in the trusts which are liable for torchmark s trust preferred securities being deconsolidated as of january  and reflected as off balance sheet arrangements  even though torchmark is the sole owner and has total voting control of these trusts 
the following table presents torchmark s scheduled contractual obligations for the selected periods as of december  millions total thereafter long term debt principal long term debt interest capital leases operating leases purchase obligations pension obligations other long term obligations total interest on debt is based on torchmark s fixed obligations 
as certain debt instruments have related swaps which exchange the fixed obligations to those based on floating rates  torchmark s actual interest cost may be greater or lesser than presented 
pension obligations are liabilities in trust funds that are funded by torchmark to provide for the pensions 
at december   these pension obligations were million but there were also assets of million in the plans to fund those obligations 
the schedule of pension benefits is based on the same assumptions used to measure the pension obligations 
all other benefit plan obligations are direct liabilities of torchmark and are included in other long term obligations 
torchmark s other long term contractual obligations at december  consisted of its long term future policy liabilities in the amount of billion and its long term employee benefit liabilities other than pensions in the amount of million 
of these amounts  million of insurance policy obligations and no employee benefit obligations were fixed and determinable as of december  these fixed and determinable obligations include amounts in which a specified balance is due to be paid at a certain specified date  such as an annuity certain 
all other insurance and benefit liabilities contain life  death  or health contingencies causing either the timing  the amount of benefit  or both not to be known until the event occurs 
therefore  torchmark has scheduled as contractual obligations only those long term obligations which are fixed and determinable at december  in accordance with gaap  torchmark carries insurance and benefit liabilities on a discounted basis on its consolidated balance sheet 
however  for the purpose of this disclosure  total benefits are shown on an undiscounted basis 
capital resources 
torchmark s capital structure consists of short term debt the commercial paper facility described above  long term funded debt  trust preferred securities  and shareholders equity 
an analysis of long term debt issues outstanding is as follows at december  long term debt at december  dollar amounts in thousands instrument year due interest rate par value book value fair value senior debentures notes notes senior notes total funded debt trust preferred securities total long term debt the carrying value of torchmark s senior notes is adjusted each period to reflect the change in fair value of a swap instrument which hedges the value of the note 
this instrument increased the value of long term debt by million and million at december  and december   respectively 
the carrying value of the funded debt was million at december   compared with million a year earlier 
effective july   torchmark adopted statement of financial accounting standard no 
accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas 
this statement specifies that torchmark s trust preferred securities are to be reported as a component of long term debt subsequent to adoption  rather than as an item reported between liabilities and equity  and that prior periods may not be restated for comparative purposes 
the inclusion of the trust preferred securities with funded debt added million to the balance 
additionally  in accordance with accounting rules  torchmark adjusts the carrying value of the senior notes for the change in value of the above mentioned swap instrument  since that derivative qualifies as a hedge 
this fair value adjustment for the swap declined million in but increased million in for more information about specific debt issues  please refer to note debt in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
during  torchmark redeemed its monthly income preferred securities  redemption amount million  and issued its million trust preferred securities and million senior notes 
information about the issuance and redemption of these instruments  including the terms and the uses of proceeds  are disclosed in note debt in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
in connection with these instruments  torchmark has in place three interest rate swap agreements in which torchmark has exchanged its fixed rate obligations on the debt instruments to floating rates 
information about these swaps is also found in this note 
torchmark maintains a significant available for sale fixed maturity portfolio to support its insurance policyholders liabilities 
torchmark is required by an accounting rule sfas to revalue this portfolio to fair market value at the end of each accounting period 
the period to period changes in fair value  net of their associated impact on deferred acquisition costs and income tax  are reflected directly in shareholders equity 
changes in the fair value of the portfolio result from changes in interest rates in financial markets 
while sfas requires invested assets to be revalued  accounting rules do not permit interest bearing insurance policy liabilities to be valued at fair value in a consistent manner 
due to the size of torchmark s policy liabilities in relation to its shareholders equity  this inconsistency in measurement usually has a material impact in the reported value of shareholders equity 
if these liabilities were revalued in the same manner as the assets  the effect on equity would be largely offset 
fluctuations in interest rates cause undue volatility in the period to period presentation of torchmark s shareholders equity  capital structure  and financial ratios which would be essentially removed if interest bearing liabilities were valued in the same manner as assets 
for this reason  torchmark s management  credit rating agencies  lenders  many industry analysts  and certain other financial statement users prefer to remove the effect of sfas when analyzing torchmark s balance sheet  capital structure  and financial ratios 
the following tables present selected data related to torchmark s capital resources

a discussion of torchmark s interest expense is included in the discussion of financing costs under the caption investments in this report 
on july   torchmark s board reaffirmed its continued authorization of the company s stock repurchase program in amounts and timing that management  in consultation with the board  determined to be in the best interest of the company 
torchmark has repurchased its common stock every year since  except for  the year following the acquisition of american income 
since  torchmark has repurchased million shares at a total cost of billion  and has acquired no fewer than million shares in any one year 
management believes that torchmark share purchases at favorable prices add incrementally to per share earnings  return on equity  and are an excellent way to increase total shareholder value 
in  torchmark acquired million shares at a cost of million 
if the million free cash flow used for the repurchase of torchmark common stock had alternatively been invested in corporate bonds  an estimated million of additional investment income  after tax  would have resulted and net income per diluted share would have increased to 
because share purchases were made  actual net income per share was  an increase of 
torchmark intends to continue the repurchase of its common shares when financial markets are favorable

other items litigation 
torchmark and its subsidiaries continue to be named as parties to pending or threatened litigation  much of which involves punitive damage claims based upon allegations of agent misconduct at liberty in alabama 
such punitive damage claims are tried in alabama state courts where any punitive damage litigation may have the potential for significant adverse results since punitive damages in alabama are based upon the compensatory damages including mental anguish awarded and the discretion of the jury in awarding compensatory damages is not precisely defined 
additionally  it should be noted that torchmark subsidiaries actively market insurance in the state of mississippi  a jurisdiction which is nationally recognized for large punitive damage verdicts 
bespeaking caution is the fact that it is impossible to predict the likelihood or extent of punitive damages that may be awarded if liability is found in any given case 
it is thus difficult to predict with certainty the liability of torchmark or its subsidiaries in any given case because of the unpredictable nature of this type of litigation

new accounting rules guaranteed minimum policy benefits 
the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position  accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises for certain nontraditional long duration contracts and for separate accounts sop 
this statement is effective for torchmark beginning january  this statement covers various aspects of accounting for nontraditional product features in order to increase uniformity in practice 
the primary issue affecting torchmark is the accounting for liabilities for certain guaranteed minimum policy benefits 
torchmark believes that this accounting change will result in a charge to earnings in a range from to million net of tax in to establish the required additional liability 
this charge will be recorded as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
in future periods  torchmark does not believe that the provision for guaranteed minimum policy benefits will have a material impact on its operations 
however  the liability for guaranteed minimum policy benefits is highly dependent on the performance of financial markets  whereby poor market performance in the future could increase torchmark s obligations 
deconsolidation 
in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  which torchmark adopted in with no impact to the consolidated financial statements 
in december   the fasb revised fin finr and deferred its adoption for variable interest entities vies that meet certain criteria until the first quarter of finr clarified the definition of a variable interest such that only the holder of a variable interest can ever be the vie s primary beneficiary 
only primary beneficiaries are permitted to consolidate vies 
therefore  finr does not permit consolidation of vies in which a company has voting control but is not the primary beneficiary 
the trusts that are liable for torchmark s trust preferred securities meet the definition of vies 
under finr  torchmark does not have a variable interest in the trusts and therefore cannot be the entity s primary beneficiary 
for this reason  torchmark may no longer consolidate the trusts  even though torchmark is the sole owner of the voting equity of these entities 
upon adoption  effective january   prior periods will be restated for comparability 
the effect of adoption will be to increase torchmark s long term debt by approximately million with a corresponding increase in an asset of equal amount 
in addition  investment income and interest expense will be increased by approximately thousand per year 
critical accounting policies future policy benefits 
because of the long term nature of insurance contracts  torchmark s insurance companies are liable for policy benefit payments that will be made in the future 
the liability for future policy benefits is determined by standard actuarial procedures common to the life insurance industry 
the accounting policies for determining this liability are disclosed in note significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
while management and company actuaries have used their best judgment in determining the assumptions and in calculating the liability for future policy benefits  there is no assurance that the estimate of the liabilities reflected in the financial statements represents torchmark s ultimate obligation 
additionally  because of the size of this liability  significantly different assumptions could result in materially different reported amounts 
a complete list of the assumptions used to calculate the liability for future policy benefits is reported in note future policy benefits reserves in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
deferred acquisition costs and value of insurance purchased 
the costs of acquiring new business are generally deferred and recorded as an asset 
deferred acquisition costs consist primarily of sales commissions and other underwriting costs of new insurance sales 
additionally  the costs of acquiring blocks of insurance from other companies or through the acquisition of other companies are also deferred and recorded as assets under the caption value of insurance purchased 
torchmark s policies for accounting for deferred acquisition costs and the associated amortization are reported in note significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
different assumptions with regard to deferred acquisition costs could produce materially different amounts of amortization 
for more information about accounting for deferred acquisition costs see note deferred acquisition costs and value of insurance purchased in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
policy claims and other benefits payable 
this liability consists of known benefits currently payable and an estimate of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported to the company 
the estimate of unreported claims is based on prior experience and is made after careful evaluation of all information available to the company 
however  the factors upon which these estimates are based can be subject to change from historical patterns 
factors involved include medical trend rates and medical cost inflation  the litigation environment  regulatory mandates  and the introduction of policy types for which claim patterns are not well established 
changes in these estimates  if any  are reflected in the earnings of the period in which the adjustment is made 
torchmark management believes that the estimates used to produce the liability for claims and other benefits  including the estimate of unsubmitted claims  are the most appropriate under the circumstances 
however  there is no certainty that the resulting stated liability will be torchmark s ultimate obligation 
revenue recognition 
premium income for torchmark s subsidiaries insurance contracts is generally recognized as the premium is collected 
however  in accordance with gaap  revenue on limited payment contracts and universal life type contracts deposit balance products are recognized differently 
revenues on limited payment contracts are recognized over the contract period 
premium for deposit balance products  such as torchmark s annuity and interest sensitive life policies  is added to the policy account value 
the policy account value or deposit balance is a torchmark liability 
this deposit balance is then charged a fee for the cost of insurance  administration  surrender  and certain other charges which are recognized as revenue in the period the fees are charged to the policyholder 
in each case  benefits and expenses are matched with revenues in a manner by which they are incurred as the revenues are earned 
investment income is reported as revenue by torchmark when it is earned  less investment expenses 
the investment activities of torchmark are integral to its insurance operations 
because life and health insurance claims and benefits may not be paid until many years into the future  the accumulation of cash flows from premium receipts are invested 
anticipated yields earned on investments are reflected in premium rates  contract liabilities  and other product contract features 
these yield assumptions are implied in the interest required on torchmark s net insurance liabilities future policy benefits less deferred acquisition costs and contractual interest obligations in its insurance and annuity products 
for more information concerning revenue recognition  investment accounting  and interest sensitivity  please refer to note significant accounting policies and note investments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and discussions under the captions annuities  investments  and market risk sensitivity in this report 
impairment of investments 
torchmark continually monitors its investment portfolio for investments that have become impaired in value 
while the values of the investments in torchmark s portfolio constantly fluctuate due to market conditions  an investment is considered to be impaired only when it has experienced a decline in fair market value which is deemed other than temporary 
the policies and procedures that torchmark uses to evaluate and account for impairments of investments are disclosed in note significant accounting policies and note investments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and the discussions under the captions investments and realized gains and losses in this report 
while every effort is made to make the best estimate of status and value with the information available regarding an other than temporary impairment  it is difficult to predict the ultimate recoverable amount of a distressed or impaired security 
defined benefit pension plans 
torchmark maintains funded defined benefit plans covering most full time employees 
it also has unfunded nonqualified defined benefit plans covering certain key and other employees 
torchmark s obligations under these plans are determined actuarially based on specified actuarial assumptions 
in accordance with gaap  an expense is recorded each year as these pension obligations grow due to the increase in the service period of employees and the interest cost associated with the passage of time 
these obligations are offset by the growth in value of the assets in the funded plans 
the actuarial assumptions used in determining torchmark s obligations for pensions include employee mortality and turnover  retirement age  the expected return on plan assets  projected salary increases  and the discount rate at which future obligations could be settled 
these assumptions have an important effect on the pension obligation 
a decrease in the discount rate or rate of return on plan assets will cause an increase in torchmark s pension obligation 
a decrease in projected salary increases will cause a decrease in this obligation 
these assumptions are subjective in many cases and small changes in certain assumptions may cause material differences in reported results 
while management has used its best efforts to determine the most reliable assumptions  given the information available from company experience  economic data  independent consultants and other sources  no assurance can be given that actual results will be the same as expected 
the assumptions are reviewed annually and revised  if necessary  based on more current information available to the company 
torchmark s discount rate  rate of return on assets  and projected salary increase assumptions are disclosed in note postretirement benefits in the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report 
this note also contains information about pension plan assets  investment policies  funded status  and other related data
