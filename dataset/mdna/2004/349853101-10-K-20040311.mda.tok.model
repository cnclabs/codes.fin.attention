item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction we provide scheduled ground transportation of cargo on a time definite basis 
while we operate as one business unit  we break out our revenue into the following three categories traditional linehaul revenue  which is the portion of our business that falls within our airport to airport network  logistics revenue  which includes dedicated or exclusive use truckload operations  and other accessorial revenue  which primarily consists of fee based ancillary services performed at the local terminal level 
as a result of our established transportation schedule and network of terminals  our operating cost structure includes significant fixed costs 
these fixed costs include amounts paid per mile to owner operators and other outside carriers to service the airport to airport network as well as dedicated logistics operations 
additionally  included are operating lease expenses as well as depreciation expense 
our ability to maintain or enhance our profit margins will depend on a number of variables including  but not limited to our ability to maintain or improve the amount as well as the price per pound of freight moving through our airport to airport network  our ability to maintain or improve the efficiency of our airport to airport network  our ability to maintain or improve the productivity at the local terminal level  our ability to locate and lease terminal facilities at or near airports at favorable rates  and our ability to effectively manage our vehicle  workers compensation and health care insurance and costs

as disclosed in note  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 
we believe that the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments 
allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances in which management is aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us for example  bankruptcy filings  accounts turned over for collection or litigation  we record a specific reserve for bad debts against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
for all other customers  we recognize reserves for bad debts based on the length of time the receivables are past due 
specifically  amounts that are days or more past due are reserved at 
if circumstances change ie  higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to us  the estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could be reduced by a material amount 
accounts are written off after all means of collection  including legal action  have been exhausted 
allowance for revenue adjustments our allowance for revenue adjustments consists of amounts reserved for billing rate changes that are not captured upon load initiation 
these adjustments generally arise when the sales department contemporaneously grants small rate changes spot quotes to customers that differ from the standard rates in the system  when freight requires dimensionalization or is reweighed resulting in a different required rate  when billing errors occur  and when data entry errors occur 
when appropriate  permanent rate changes are initiated and reflected in the system 
we monitor the manual revenue adjustments closely through the employment of various controls that are in place to ensure that revenue recognition is not compromised or that fraud does not occur 
during  average revenue adjustments per month were approximately  on average revenue per month of million less than of monthly revenue 
in order to estimate the allowance for revenue adjustments related to ending accounts receivable  we prepare an analysis that considers average monthly revenue adjustments and the average lag for identifying and quantifying 
table of contents these revenue adjustments 
based on this analysis  we establish an allowance for approximately days dependent upon experience in the last twelve months of average revenue adjustments  adjusted for rebates and billing errors 
the lag is periodically adjusted based on actual historical experience 
additionally  the average amount of revenue adjustments per month can vary in relation to the level of sales or based on other factors such as personnel issues that could result in excessive manual errors or in excessive spot quotes being granted 
both of these significant assumptions are continually evaluated for validity 
self insurance loss reserves given the nature of our operating environment  we are subject to vehicle  workers compensation and health insurance claims 
to mitigate a portion of these risks  we maintain insurance for individual vehicle claims exceeding  and workers compensation claims and health insurance claims exceeding  the amount of self insurance loss reserves and loss adjustment expenses is determined based on an estimation process that uses information obtained from both company specific and industry data  as well as general economic information 
the estimation process for self insurance loss exposure requires management to continuously monitor and evaluate the life cycle of claims 
using data obtained from this monitoring and our assumptions about the emerging trends  management develops information about the size of ultimate claims based on its historical experience and other available market information 
the most significant assumptions used in the estimation process include determining the trend in loss costs  the expected consistency in the frequency and severity of claims incurred but not yet reported to prior year claims  changes in the timing of the reporting of losses from the loss date to the notification date  and expected costs to settle unpaid claims 
management also monitors the reasonableness of the judgments made in the prior year s estimation process referred to as a hindsight analysis and adjusts current year assumptions based on the hindsight analysis 
additionally  beginning in  we utilized an actuary to evaluate open vehicle liability claims and estimate the ongoing development exposure 
liquidity and capital resources we have historically financed our working capital needs  including capital purchases  with cash flows from operations and borrowings under our bank lines of credit 
net cash provided by operating activities totaled approximately million for compared with million in net cash provided by investing activities was approximately million for compared with net cash used in investing activities of million in investing activities consisted primarily of the purchase of operating equipment and management information systems  and the proceeds from the sales or maturities of available for sale securities during net cash provided by financing activities totaled approximately million for compared with net cash used in financing activities of million in financing activities included the repayment of long term debt and capital leases  proceeds received from the exercise of stock options and repurchases of our common stock 

table of contents we expect net capital expenditures in for operating equipment and management information systems to be approximately million 
we intend to fund these expenditures through cash currently on our balance sheet  cash provided by operating activities or borrowings under our credit facility  if necessary 
the capital expenditure budget does not include any allocation for acquisitions 
our credit facility consists of a working capital line of credit 
as long as we comply with the financial covenants and ratios  the credit facility permits us to borrow up to million less the amount of any outstanding letters of credit 
interest rates for advances under the facility vary based on how our performance measures against covenants related to total indebtedness  cash flows  results of operations and other ratios 
the facility bears interest at libor plus to and is unsecured 
the facility s expiration was extended until april by letter agreement entered into in at december   we had million of available borrowing capacity under the line of credit facility and had utilized million of availability for outstanding letters of credit 
as of december   we were in compliance with the financial covenants and ratios under the credit facility 
on july   we announced that our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program for up to  shares of our common stock 
we expect to fund the repurchases of our common stock from our cash and cash equivalents and available for sale securities and cash generated from operating activities 
as of december   we had repurchased  shares of our common stock for million for an average purchase price of per share 
off balance sheet arrangements at december   we had letters of credit outstanding from a bank totaling million required by our workers compensation and vehicle liability insurance providers 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments our contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of december  in thousands are summarized below contractual obligations payment due period less than after total year years years years capital lease obligations operating leases total contractual cash obligations at december   we had outstanding orders for trailers with a cost of approximately million which will be delivered and paid for in 
table of contents we believe that our available cash  cash expected to be generated from future operations and available borrowings under lines of credit  will be sufficient to satisfy anticipated cash needs for at least the next twelve months
