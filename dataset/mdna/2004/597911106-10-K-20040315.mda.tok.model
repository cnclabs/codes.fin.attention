the sluggish economy  coupled with the effects of the war in iraq and increased security measures  have depressed passenger demand and increased operating costs 
these pressures  along with increased competition from legacy and low cost carriers that has depressed fares  resulted in the company reporting operating losses in  and in  the company took comprehensive action to improve its financial performance by increasing revenue  reducing costs and providing for improved liquidity 
the efforts included the launch of midwest airlines saver service in august to better serve high volume leisure markets 
schedule changes at midwest connect to reduce average flight lengths on regional jet routes  and better align capacity with demand on turboprop routes 
significant cost restructuring measures in the third quarter  including restructured labor agreements with five year terms for represented employee groups 
productivity improvements and headcount reductions for non represented employees 
adjustment of the company s fleet plan  including a change in the boeing aircraft delivery schedule beginning in april to one each quarter from one each month  and a deferral of the embraer delivery schedule to renegotiation of aircraft finance agreements to reduce obligations to market value 
transactions to accomplish a recapitalization of the company placement of million of convertible senior secured notes 
a private equity placement with net proceeds of million 
sale leaseback of the company s headquarters facility  resulting in net proceeds of million

in addition  the company implemented an additional workforce reduction  and remaining non union employees received temporary across the board compensation reductions 
in addition  in august  the company finalized agreements with labor unions  lessors and lenders on permanent cost reductions 
the company is targeting its financial restructuring initiatives to improve profitability and reduce costs  relative to what it would have experienced if it had not effected these changes  by approximately million annually going forward 
the cost reductions relate to the following areas labor cost savings and productivity improvements from the company s employee unions 
all three of the company s represented employee groups the midwest air line pilots association  the skyway air line pilots association and the midwest association of flight attendants ratified agreements 
the duration of these agreements is five years 
identification of opportunities to enhance productivity for non represented employees

the company completed negotiations with aircraft manufacturers to adjust the delivery schedule of its boeing aircraft program and defer its acquisition of embraer regional jets 
midwest airlines will continue to accept boeing s at its current rate of one each month through march  when deliveries will change to approximately quarterly 
under the new schedule  midwest will acquire the s it has ordered by october midwest connect will defer its acquisition of embraer regional jets from january to july  during which time the availability of long term aircraft financing is expected to improve 
the embraer contract has been amended to reflect this agreement 
midwest connect will not incur any cost or face claims for breach of contract from the deferral 
renegotiation of aircraft finance agreements

the company believes approximately of the cost reduction measures planned for represented employees and of the cost reduction measures planned for non represented employees were implemented by year end  although the company did not receive full benefit in the remaining cost reductions are expected to be achieved in completion of county transaction on october   the company completed a transaction that resulted in milwaukee county becoming the guarantor of principal and interest payments on approximately million of industrial development revenue bonds issued in and by the city of milwaukee to finance the construction of two airport based maintenance facilities 
credit support for the bonds was previously provided by letters of credit issued under the company s bank credit facility 
the guarantee provided by milwaukee county enabled the company to reduce its bank credit facility exposure from million to approximately million 
the remaining million represented letters of credit for which the company was required to provide cash as collateral 
this enabled the credit facility banks to release all other collateral previously provided as security 
in addition  certain of the company s facilities and cash totaling million were pledged as security under the agreement with milwaukee county 
this transaction resulted in the termination of the senior secured bank credit facility after approximately million of letters of credit were cancelled or transferred to another financial institution  which was completed in the first quarter of private placement of debt and equityon september   the company entered into agreements under which it raised financing of approximately million net proceeds of approximately million  after commissions and expenses

capacity  as measured by scheduled service available seat miles asms  decreased in capacity decreased at midwest airlines and decreased at midwest connect 
midwest airlines capacity decreased due to a net of four fewer aircraft in the fleet year over year  as well as a decrease in the number of scheduled operations as the company attempted to align capacity with lower demand  partially offset by the additional seats on the saver service product during the latter part of the year 
midwest connect s capacity decrease was due primarily to the implementation of schedule changes to reduce average flight lengths on regional jet routes and to better align capacity with demand  particularly on turboprop routes 
traffic  as measured by revenue passenger miles  increased 
load factor increased from in to in the company s total revenue in decreased million  or  from to million 
the decrease in revenue was due primarily to a decline in revenue yield of at midwest airlines and at midwest connect 
the decreases in revenue yield were due in large part to a continued decline in high yield business travel  heavy industrywide fare discounting implemented to stimulate travel demand  and increased competition in many markets  including midwest airlines main base of operations in milwaukee 
the introduction of saver service  which began operations in august  also contributed to the decline in revenue yield as fares are generally lower  by design  for that service 
the company s operating expenses decreased by million  or  in to million 
the company realized savings from companywide cost reduction efforts  with reduced costs in most expense categories 
operating costs include a charge of million pre tax related to the early recognition of lease expense on seven leased dc aircraft removed from service during the year

load factor increased from in to in midwest connect passenger revenue decreased million  or  from to million in this decrease was primarily caused by an decrease in revenue yield 
revenue yield decreased due to decreased business travel and lower fares that were used to stimulate travel demand 
the decrease in revenue yield was partially offset by a increase in passenger volume  as measured by revenue passenger miles 
load factor increased from in to in revenue from cargo  charter and other services increased million in midwest airlines benefited from increased revenue from charter sales as more aircraft time was available for charter service and the company had exclusive charter rights for nine professional sports teams as of december  the increased charter revenue was partially offset by a million decrease in cargo revenue 
most of this decrease was due to lower us postal service mail volumes  in large part the result of security directives and restrictions  as well as a new contract with the us postal service that has resulted in lower initial volumes 
operating expenses operating expenses decreased million  or  from to million in the company realized savings from companywide cost reduction efforts  with reduced costs in many categories  as detailed below 
operating costs include a million pre tax impairment charge related to the early retirement of the company s dc fleet 
the company s cost per total asm decreased  from in to in salaries  wages and benefits salaries  wages and benefits decreased million  or  from to million in the labor cost decrease reflects the reduction of full time equivalent employees year over year 
the headcount decrease was primarily the result of furloughing employees to align with reduced capacity and increase employee productivity  as well as attrition 
a million reduction in labor rates also contributed to decreased labor costs 
these decreases were partially offset by increased benefit costs  primarily higher medical insurance costs 
on a cost per total asm basis  labor costs decreased from in to in aircraft fuel and oil aircraft fuel and oil and associated taxes increased million  or  from to million in costs increased on a cost per asm basis 
into plane fuel prices increased in  averaging per gallon in versus per gallon in  resulting in a million unfavorable pre tax price impact 
fuel consumption decreased in because of a decrease in flight operations  as well as lower fuel consumption rates of the boeing aircraft compared with the dc fleet 
as of december   the company had no fuel hedges in place for current or later periods 
commissions commissions decreased million  or  from to million in this category includes travel agent commissions and credit card transaction commissions

the decrease was caused by lower costs at midwest airlines due to the phase out of the dc aircraft and was partially offset by increased maintenance costs at midwest connect due to higher costs of maintaining the jet aircraft 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization decreased million  or  from to million in costs in this category were essentially unchanged as the addition of one md aircraft to the fleet in march and the acquisition of spare parts to support the boeing program were offset by the decrease in depreciation related to the dc aircraft retired from the fleet year over year 
on a cost per total asm basis  these costs increased due to the company s reduced capacity year over year 
aircraft rentals aircraft rental costs increased million  or  from to million in the increase was due primarily to the early recognition of million pre tax of lease expense on seven leased dc aircraft removed from service during  as well as the addition of leased boeing aircraft to the midwest airlines fleet year over year

in connection with this decision  the company performed evaluations to determine  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal on long lived assets  whether probability weighted future cash flows from an asset undiscounted and without interest charges expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of these aircraft would be less than the aggregate carrying amounts 
as a result of the evaluation  the company determined that the estimated probability weighted future cash flows would be less than the aggregate carrying amounts  resulting in impairment as defined by sfas no 
consequently  in first quarter  the cost bases of these assets were reduced to reflect the fair market value at the date of the decision  resulting in a million pre tax impairment loss  and the remaining depreciable lives were adjusted for the new retirement schedule 
in determining the fair market value of these assets  the company considered market trends in aircraft dispositions  data from third parties and management estimates 
other operating expenses other operating expenses decreased million  or  from to million in other operating expenses consist primarily of advertising and promotion  insurance  property taxes  flight training  legal fees  crew hotel rooms  reservation fees  administration and other items

credit for income taxes income tax credit for was million  a million decrease from the income tax credit of million 
the effective tax rates for and were and  respectively 
the rate decreased due to the uncertainty of realization of state net operating losses 
net loss net loss for was million  which reflects an improvement of million from the net loss of million 
the net loss margin improved from in to in critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the company s financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires the company to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect amounts of assets and liabilities reported in the consolidated financial statements  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  and reported amounts or revenues and expenses during the year 
the company believes its estimates and assumptions are reasonable  however future results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are policies that reflect material judgment and uncertainty and may result in materially different results using different assumptions or conditions 
the company considers the following as its critical accounting policies and estimates frequent flyer revenue  impairment of long lived assets and warrant valuation 
for a detailed discussion of accounting policies  refer to the notes to the consolidated financial statements as of december  contained in this annual report on form k 
frequent flyer revenue a portion of the revenue from the sale of frequent flyer mileage credits is deferred and recognized as passenger revenue when transportation is likely to be provided  based on estimates of the fair value of tickets to be redeemed  straight line over months  which is the company s estimate of when travel will occur 
the estimated incremental cost of providing future transportation in conjunction with travel miles under the company s frequent flyer program is accrued based on an estimated redemption percentage of applied to actual mileage recorded in members accounts over the standard award level 
as part of estimating incremental costs  the company includes the additional costs related to transportation of passengers  over and above costs to transport vacant seats  such as fuel  meals  insurance and ticketing 
a change to these cost estimates and the estimated redemption percentage could have a significant impact on the company s liability in the period the change is made  as well as in future periods 
the ultimate cost will depend on the actual redemption of frequent flyer miles  and may be greater or less than amounts accrued at december  impairment of long lived assets the company records impairment charges on long lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate the assets may be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying amount 
the company uses judgment when applying the impairment rules to determine when an impairment test is necessary 
factors the company considers that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical or forecasted operating results  a significant decrease in the market value of an asset  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the carrying value of an asset exceeds its estimated fair value 
the company is required to make estimates of its future cash flows related to the asset subject to review 
these estimates require assumptions about demand for the company s service  future market conditions and industry competition 
other assumptions include determining the discount rule and future growth rates 
during  the company performed an analysis to determine if there was potential impairment of the md fleet 
based on the estimated useful lives of these assets of approximately years  no impairment was determined 
this determination would not change with a change in the assumptions and estimates used in the calculation of the impairment 
warrant valuation in connection with the final restructuring agreements with the aircraft lessors and lenders  the company issued warrants to certain lessors and lenders that currently give the holders the right to purchase  in the aggregate   shares of the company s stock at an exercise price per share of 
the company used the black scholes model to value the liability to the company as of the date of issuance 
the black scholes model uses a number of estimates  such as expected volatility  risk free interest rate  forfeiture rate and expected life in years 
the estimation techniques used are consistent with those used in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on form k 
off balance sheet arrangements an off balance sheet arrangement is any transaction  agreement or other contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has made guarantees  a retained or a contingent interest in transferred assets  an obligation under derivative instruments classified as equity  or any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing  liquidity  market risk or credit risk support to the company  or that engages in leasing  hedging  or research and development arrangements with the company 
the company has no arrangements of the types described in any of the categories that may have a material current or future effect on the company s financial condition  liquidity or results of operations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on form k 
liquidity and capital resources the company s unrestricted cash and cash equivalents totaled million at december   compared with million at december  at december   the restricted cash balance was million  compared with million on december  the change in restricted cash is primarily attributable to an increase in the cash holdback amount related to credit card processing agreements that are discussed in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
cash collateral used to support outstanding letters of credit also contributed to the increase in restricted cash 
the unrestricted cash balance at december  reflects the effects of the significant restructuring of lease and debt payments and other cost reduction measures completed in third and fourth quarters  as well as the debt financing  equity financing and sale leaseback of the company s headquarters 
these transactions are discussed in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on form k 
as part of the restructuring efforts  the company suspended lease and debt payments on most of its aircraft from march to august the aggregate amount of the payments that the company had not made as a result of the lease and debt payment moratorium was approximately million 
in july  the company made payments totaling million to the lessors and lenders in conjunction with the signing of tentative agreements to restructure the aircraft financings 
in august  the agreements were finalized and the company paid an additional million to the lessors and lenders 
for the remainder of the year  the company made lease payments at revised  lower lease rates 
the company s subsidiaries also delivered subordinated promissory notes to the lessors and lenders  the aggregate principal amount of which is million 
as of december   the company had a working capital surplus of million compared with a million deficit on december  the improvement in working capital as of december  is primarily related to an increase in cash associated with the proceeds from the private placement of convertible debt and equity and the sale leaseback of the company s headquarters 
a reduction in notes payable related to the bank credit facility and a reduction in current maturities of long term debt related to the aircraft debt restructuring finalized in august also contributed to the improvement in working capital 
operating activities net cash provided by operations for the year ended december  totaled million 
cash provided by operations at december  primarily reflects the effects of credits used related to the acquisition of boeing aircraft 
midwest airlines has used credit memos from certain suppliers associated with the delivery of each boeing aircraft for the acquisition of aircraft spare parts and maintenance tooling  employee training  flight simulator rental  aircraft lease payments and engine maintenance agreements  and accordingly there was no cash outlay for these expenses 
as of december   the amount of unused credit memos totaled million and is recorded as other assets
