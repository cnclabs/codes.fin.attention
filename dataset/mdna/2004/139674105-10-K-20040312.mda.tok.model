executive overview the company is a financial holding company and a bank holding company headquartered in tallahassee  florida that provides through its wholly owned subsidiary  capital city bank  a broad array of products and services in florida counties  four georgia counties  and one alabama county 
the bank also has mortgage lending offices in four additional florida communities 
the bank offers commercial and retail banking services  as well as trust and asset management  brokerage  and data processing services 
from an industry and national perspective  the company s profitability  like most financial institutions  is dependent to a large extent upon net interest income  which is the difference between the interest received on earning assets  such as loans and securities  and the interest paid on interest bearing liabilities  principally deposits and borrowings 
results of operations are also affected by the provision for loan losses  operating expenses such as salaries and employee benefits  occupancy and other operating expenses  including income taxes  and  to a lesser extent  non interest income such as service charges on deposit accounts  trust service fees  mortgage banking revenues  and data processing revenues 
economic conditions  competition and the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government in general  significantly affect financial institutions  including the company 
during  the federal government s focus was marked by steady low interest rates intended to stabilize the current economy and to provide stimulation to future industrial economic growth 
lending activities are also significantly influenced by regional and local economic factors 
some specific factors may include the demand for and supply of housing  competition among lenders  interest rate conditions and prevailing market rates on competing investments  customer preferences and levels of personal income and savings in the company s primary market area 
the company philosophy is to grow and prosper  building long term relationships based on quality service  high ethical standards  and safe and sound banking practices 
the company is a super community bank in the relationship banking business with a locally oriented  community based focus  which is augmented by experienced  centralized support in select specialized areas

acquisitions will be focused on a three state area including florida  georgia  and alabama with a particular focus on acquiring banks and branches  which are million to million in asset size  located on the outskirts of major metropolitan areas 
the company will evaluate de novo expansion opportunities in attractive new markets in the event that acquisition opportunities are not feasible 
other expansion opportunities that will be evaluated include asset management  insurance  and mortgage banking 
management anticipates that roughly half of the company s future earnings growth will be generated through growth in existing markets and half through acquisitions 
pending acquisition on january   the company announced the signing of a definitive agreement to acquire quincy state bank  located in quincy  florida from synovus financial corp 
quincy state bank is a million asset institution as of december  with offices in quincy and havana  florida 
both markets adjoin leon county  home to the company s tallahassee headquarters 
the purchase price is million in cash and the closing is scheduled for late in the first quarter of previous acquisitions on march   the company completed a purchase and assumption transaction with wachovia bank  na  formerly first union national bank wachovia and acquired six of wachovia s offices in georgia which included real estate  loans and deposits 
the transaction resulted in approximately million in intangible assets  primarily core deposit intangibles  which are being amortized over a year period 
the company purchased approximately million in loans and assumed deposits of approximately million 
on march   the company completed its acquisition of first bankshares of west point  inc  and its subsidiary  first national bank of west point 
at the time of the acquisition  first national bank of west point had approximately million in assets with one office in west point  georgia  and two offices in the greater valley area of alabama 
first bankshares of west point  inc  merged with the company  and first national bank of west point merged with capital city bank 
the company issued shares and in cash for each of the  outstanding shares of first bankshares of west point  inc  resulting in the issuance of  shares of company common stock and the payment of million in cash for a total purchase price of approximately million 
the transaction was accounted for as a purchase and resulted in approximately million of intangible assets  primarily goodwill

this compares to million  or per diluted share in  and million  or per diluted share in return on average assets was and return on average shareowners equity was for  compared to s results of and  respectively  and s performance of 
and  respectively 
the increase in earnings was primarily attributable to growth in operating revenues defined as the total of net interest income and noninterest income of  driven by growth in noninterest income 
the increase in noninterest income reflects higher deposit fees  merchant service fee income and mortgage banking revenues 
these and other significant factors are discussed throughout the financial review

in  taxable equivalent net interest income increased  or 
this follows an increase of million  or  in  and million  or  in the favorable impact was a result of lower funding costs and a shift in earning assets mix  partially offset by declining asset yields attributable to the low interest rate environment 
lower interest rates paid on deposit products and a favorable shift in deposit mix led to a net reduction in interest expense of million over this favorable variance continued to be partially offset by declining yields on earning assets  which produced a decline in taxable equivalent interest income of million 
over the last three years  management has aggressively repriced interest bearing liabilities in response to the federal reserve s reduction in its target rate on overnight funds

changes which are not solely due to volume changes or solely due to rate changes have been attributed to rate changes 
interest income includes the effects of taxable equivalent adjustments using a tax rate to adjust interest on tax exempt loans and securities to a taxable equivalent basis 
for the year  taxable equivalent interest income decreased million  or  over  and million  or  in over new loan production and repricing of existing earning assets produced a basis point reduction in the yield on earning assets  which declined from for to for this compares to a basis point reduction in over the unfavorable impact of declining yields was partially mitigated by growth in earning assets of million  which produced an overall improvement in the mix 
the yield on the investment securities portfolio continued to decline as a result of the low rate environment 
as shown in table  both the investment and loan portfolios were significant contributors to the net reduction in interest income 
in the current rate environment  portfolio repricing will continue to put pressure on interest income  but may be partially or completely offset by earning asset growth 
interest expense decreased million  or  over  and million  or  in over the general decline in interest rates produced favorable rate variances on interest bearing liabilities throughout the year 
this was further enhanced by a favorable shift in mix  as certificates of deposit generally a higher cost deposit product declined relative to total deposits 
certificates of deposit  as a percent of total average deposits  declined from in to in lower interest rates and a favorable shift in mix led to a decline in the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities in of basis points compared to the company s interest rate spread defined as the taxable equivalent yield on average earning assets less the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities decreased basis points in and increased basis points in the decrease in was attributable to the continued decline in the earning asset yield 
the significant increase in is attributable to management s ability to rapidly adjust the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities relative to the decline in yield on earning assets 
the company s net interest margin defined as taxable equivalent interest income less interest expense divided by average earning assets was in  compared to in and in in  the lower yields on earning assets partially offset by lower rates paid on interest bearing liabilities resulted in the basis point decline in the margin 
loan growth is anticipated to have a favorable impact on the net interest margin during the upcoming year along with any favorable changes in the federal reserve s target rate on overnight funds 
however  depending on the magnitude of the loan growth  the improvement attributable to growth may be partially or completely offset by unfavorable repricing variances associated with loans and securities and any further unfavorable changes in the federal reserve s target rate on overnight funds 
a further discussion of the company s earning assets and funding sources can be found in the section entitled financial condition 
provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses was million in  compared to million in and million in the slight increase in the provision reflects a slightly higher level of net charge offs 
the company s stable provision over the last three year period reflects continued stable credit quality supported by an adequate allowance for loan losses 
net charge offs remain at historically low levels relative to the size of the portfolio 
net charge offs for totaled million  or 
of average loans 
this compares to million  or 
for the increase is due primarily to a higher level of consumer loan net charge offs  primarily automobile loans 
in addition  the increase in over is reflective of an above normal level of consumer loan recoveries in at december   the allowance for loan losses totaled million compared to million in at year end  the allowance represented of total loans and provided coverage of of nonperforming loans 
management considers the allowance to be adequate based on the current level of nonperforming loans and the estimate of losses inherent in the portfolio at year end 
see the section entitled financial condition and tables and for further information regarding the allowance for loan losses 
noninterest income in  noninterest income increased million  or  and represented of operating revenue  compared to an increase of million  or  and  respectively  in the increase in the level of noninterest income is attributable primarily to growth in deposit service charges  merchant service fee income  and mortgage banking revenues 
the increase in was attributable to growth in deposit service charges  mortgage banking revenues  and other income primarily retail brokerage fees and atm debit credit card transaction fees 
factors affecting noninterest income are discussed below 
service charges on deposit accounts increased million  or  in  compared to an increase of million  or  in service charge revenues in any one year are dependent on the number of accounts  primarily transaction accounts  the level of activity subject to service charges  and the collection rate 
the increase in service charges in was primarily attributable to growth in nsf overdraft fees associated with a new overdraft protection program implemented in the fourth quarter of integration of acquisitions during will further enhance deposit service charge revenues 
the increase in service charges in reflects an increase in the number of deposit accounts  primarily attributable to the georgia banking office acquisitions  and increased nsf overdraft fees in the fourth quarter of data processing revenues increased  or  in versus a decrease of  or  in the data processing center provides computer services to both financial and non financial clients in north florida and south georgia 
the increase in was due to higher revenues from both financial clients and government contract processing 
the company added one financial client in late increasing the number currently being processed to six 
in addition  government contract processing increased during primarily due to increased processing volume with one client 
in  processing revenues for non financial entities represented approximately of total processing  compared to in the decrease in total processing revenues for was primarily the result of a decline in revenues for financial clients 
management expects data processing revenues to remain stable during in  asset management fees increased  or  versus a decrease of  or  in at year end  assets under management totaled million  reflecting growth of million  or over this growth is due to an increase in new business in existing markets and appreciation in stock market values over at year end  assets under management totaled million  reflecting growth of million  or over the company continues to be among the leaders in the production of residential mortgage loans in many of its markets 
in  mortgage banking revenues increased  or  compared to million  or in the increase in was due to the continued low interest rate environment resulting in a high level of fixed rate loan production through the third quarter of the year 
the company generally sells all fixed rate residential loan production into the secondary market 
fixed rate mortgage refinancing activity slowed significantly in the fourth quarter of and as a result mortgage banking revenues declined in the fourth quarter 
management does not expect mortgage banking revenues to remain at the levels experienced in the increase in revenue in was due to higher fixed rate mortgage production driven by the low interest rate environment  and a gain pre tax of  on the one time sale of million in residential mortgage loans during the fourth quarter of the level of interest rates  origination volume and percent of fixed rate production have a significant impact on the company s mortgage banking revenues 
other noninterest income increased million  or  in versus an increase of  or in the increase in was attributable primarily to an increase in merchant service fee income and miscellaneous recoveries 
merchant service fee income increased  or  due to increased transaction volume and was partially offset with higher interchange service fees  which is reflected in noninterest expense 
miscellaneous recoveries were  or  higher as a result of recovering legal and settlement costs associated with two lawsuits 
the increase in noninterest income was attributable primarily to higher retail brokerage fees and atm debit credit card transaction fees 
noninterest income as a percent of average assets increased to in  compared to in  and in  driven primarily by service charge income  mortgage banking revenues and merchant service fee income 
noninterest expense noninterest expense for was million  an increase of million  or  over  compared with an increase of million  or  in factors impacting the company s noninterest expense during and are discussed below 
the company s aggregate compensation expense in totaled million  an increase of million  or  over the increase is primarily attributable to associate salary increases  higher performance based compensation commissions  increased pension costs  and higher healthcare insurance premiums 
the increase in associate salaries reflects normal annual merit increases and higher performance based compensation  which is reflective of higher commissions paid to mortgage originators 
the higher pension cost is a result of an increase in the number of plan participants and the lower than expected return on plan assets resulting from the general stock market decline in recent years 
pension costs are expected to increase in by approximately 
healthcare premiums are expected to continue to increase due to additional participants and rising costs from healthcare providers 
in  aggregate compensation increased million  or  over this increase was primarily due to the addition of georgia and alabama offices  higher performance based compensation profit participation  commissions  and incentives  increased pension costs  and higher healthcare insurance premiums 
occupancy expense including furniture  fixtures and equipment increased by  or  in  compared to  or in the increase in was primarily due to higher furniture fixture  utility  and building depreciation expenses associated with the addition of four new offices 
the increase in was primarily due to the addition of nine offices associated with the georgia acquisitions  and costs associated with the conversion and full implementation of a new data processing system 
additional increases were experienced for in office leases and building maintenance repairs 
other noninterest expense increased  or  in  compared to million  or  in the increase in was attributable to higher legal costs of  primarily resulting from corporate governance compliance work associated with the sarbanes oxley act  increased processing expenses of  associated with implementation of new database systems in human resources  and custom programming work performed by the bank s core processing system vendor to facilitate the implementation of new applications platform automation and home banking  and increased interchange service fees of  associated with higher merchant card processing volume 
these increases were partially offset with approximately  lower expense for contingency reserves  and lower seminar education expense of  the increase in was attributable to higher legal costs of  primarily resulting from merchant credit card processing  increased professional fees associated with external audit  tax and pension consulting of  increased processing expenses of  associated with customization of a newly implemented data processing system  increased atm processing and trust account processing  increased contributions of  attributable to increased funding for capital city bank group foundation  inc  increased telephone costs of  resulting from georgia acquisitions and line upgrades to the existing wide area network  and higher miscellaneous expense of million attributable to loan underwriting closing costs  other losses cash short  credit card interchange fees  seminars education  and other miscellaneous 
the net noninterest expense ratio defined as noninterest income minus noninterest expense  net of intangible amortization and conversion merger related expenses  as a percent of average assets was in compared to in  and in the company s efficiency ratio expressed as noninterest expense  net of intangible amortization and conversion merger related expenses  as a percent of taxable equivalent operating revenues was   and in  and  respectively 
income taxes the consolidated provision for federal and state income taxes was million in  compared to million in  and million in the increase in the tax provision was a result of higher taxable income and a decline in tax exempt income 
the increase in the tax provision from was also due to higher taxable income and lower tax exempt income 
the effective tax rate was in  in  and in the decrease in the effective tax rate for is due to an adjustment in federal income tax expense in the amount of  made during the fourth quarter of following a recent irs examination  the company performed an evaluation of all its tax accounts 
upon completion of this analysis in the fourth quarter of  the company determined certain tax accounts should be adjusted to more appropriately reflect its current and deferred assets and liabilities 
the effective tax rates previously noted differ from the combined federal and state statutory tax rates due primarily to tax exempt income 
the increase in the effective tax rate for was primarily attributable to an increase in state taxable income as well as a decline of tax exempt income relative to pre tax income 
financial condition average assets totaled billion  an increase of million  or  in versus the comparable period in average earning assets for were billion  representing an increase of million  or  over during  average loans increased million  or  and average funds sold increased million  or 
these increases were partially offset by a decline in average securities of million  or 
loan growth during was primarily funded through existing liquidity and deposit growth 
table provides information on average balances and rates  table provides an analysis of rate and volume variances  while table highlights the changing mix of the company s earning assets over the last three years 
loans average loans increased million  or  over the comparable period in loan growth was slow for the first quarter of the year  but picked up momentum during the second and third quarters 
loans  on average  increased million in the second quarter and million in the third quarter 
loan growth fell off during the fourth quarter primarily due to a decline in the residential held for sale loan portfolio 
loans as a percent of average earning assets increased to for the year  compared to for the comparable period of loan growth occurred in all loan categories during the year with the exception of residential family 
the decline in the residential family was due to a decline in held for sale loans resulting from a slow down in refinancing activity during the fourth quarter of management anticipates that the pace of loan refinancing will slow in resulting in loan production producing greater net growth for the total loan portfolio 
although management is continually evaluating alternative sources of revenue  lending is a major component of the company s business and is key to profitability 
while management strives to identify opportunities to increase loans outstanding and enhance the portfolio s overall contribution to earnings  it can do so only by adhering to sound lending principles applied in a prudent and consistent manner 
thus  management will not relax its underwriting standards in order to achieve designated growth goals

allowance for loan losses management maintains the allowance for loan losses at a level sufficient to provide for the estimated credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date 
credit losses arise from the borrowers inability and unwillingness to repay  and from other risks inherent in the lending process including collateral risk  operations risk  concentration risk and economic risk 
as such  all related risks of lending are considered when assessing the adequacy of the loan loss reserve 
the allowance for loan losses is established through a provision charged to expense 
loans are charged against the allowance when management believes collection of the principal is unlikely 
the allowance for loan losses is based on management s judgment of overall loan quality 
this is a significant estimate based on a detailed analysis of the loan portfolio 
the balance can and will change based on changes in the assessment of the portfolio s overall credit quality 
management evaluates the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis 
loans that have been identified as impaired are reviewed for adequacy of collateral  with a specific reserve assigned to those loans when necessary 
impaired loans are defined as those in which the full collection of principal and interest in accordance with the contractual terms is improbable 
impaired loans generally include those that are past due for days or more and those classified as doubtful in accordance with the company s risk rating system 
loans classified as doubtful have a high possibility of loss  but because of certain factors that may work to strengthen the loan  its classification as a loss is deferred until a more exact status may be determined 
not all loans are considered in the review for impairment  only loans that are for business purposes exceeding  are considered 
the evaluation is based on current financial condition of the borrower or current payment status of the loan 
the method used to assign a specific reserve depends on whether repayment of the loan is dependent on liquidation of collateral 
if repayment is dependent on the sale of collateral  the reserve is equivalent to the recorded investment in the loan less the fair value of the collateral after estimated sales expenses 
if repayment is not dependent on the sale of collateral  the reserve is equivalent to the recorded investment in the loan less the estimated cash flows discounted using the loan s effective interest rate 
the discounted value of the cash flows is based on the anticipated timing of the receipt of cash payments from the borrower 
the reserve allocations assigned to impaired loans are sensitive to the extent market conditions or the actual timing of cash receipts change 
once specific reserves have been assigned to impaired loans  general reserves are assigned to the remaining portfolio 
general reserves are assigned to commercial purpose loans exceeding  that are not impaired  but that have weaknesses requiring closer management attention 
general reserves are also assigned to commercial purpose loans exceeding  that do not exhibit weaknesses requiring closer monitoring 
finally  general reserves are assigned to large groups of smaller balance homogenous loans  including commercial purpose loans less than  consumer loans  credit card loans and residential mortgage loans 
large commercial purpose loans exhibiting specific weaknesses are detailed in a monthly problem loan report 
these loans are divided into ten different pools based on various risk characteristics and the underlying value of collateral taken to secure specific loans within the pools 
these classified loans are monitored for changes in risk ratings that are assigned based on the bank s asset classification policy  and for the ultimate disposition of the loan 
the ultimate disposition may include upgrades in risk ratings  payoff of the loan  or charge off of the loan 
this migration analysis results in a charge off ratio by loan pool of classified loans that is applied to the balance of the pool to determine general reserves for specifically identified problem loans 
this charge off ratio is adjusted for various environmental factors including past due and nonperforming trends in the loan portfolio  the micro and macro economic outlook  and credit administration practices as determined by independent parties 
general reserves are assigned to large commercial purpose loans exceeding  that do not exhibit weaknesses and pools of smaller balance homogenous loans based on calculated overall charge off ratios over the past three years 
the charge off ratios applied are adjusted as detailed above  with further consideration given to the highest charge off experience of the bank dating back to the recession of the late s 
the allowance for loan losses is compared against the sum of the specific reserves assigned to problem loans plus the general reserves assigned to pools of loans that are not specific problem loans 
adjustments are made when appropriate 
a most likely reserve value is determined within the computed range of required calculated reserve  with the actual allowance for loan losses compared to the most likely reserve value 
the unallocated reserve is monitored on a regular basis and adjusted based on qualitative factors

while there can be no assurance that the company will not sustain loan losses in a particular period that are substantial in relation to the size of the allowance  management s assessment of the loan portfolio does not indicate a likelihood of this occurrence 
it is management s opinion that the allowance at december  is adequate to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio at year end 
table provides an allocation of the allowance for loan losses to specific loan types for each of the past five years 
the reserve allocations  as calculated using the above methodology  are assigned to specific loan categories corresponding to the type represented within the components discussed 
the greatest losses experienced by the company have occurred in the consumer loan portfolio  including credit cards 
as such  the greatest amount of the allowance is allocated to consumer loans despite its relatively small balance 
management is constantly reviewing the delivery  underwriting and collection of these products to reduce loan losses 
risk element assets risk element assets consist of nonaccrual loans  renegotiated loans  other real estate  loans past due days or more  potential problem loans and loan concentrations 
table depicts certain categories of the company s risk element assets as of december for each of the last five years 
potential problem loans and loan concentrations are discussed within the narrative portion of this section 
the company s nonperforming loans decreased  or from a level of million at december   to million at december  during loans totaling approximately million were added  while loans totaling million were removed from nonaccruing status 
a single loan of million was both added and removed during the year 
of the million removed  million consisted of principal reductions and loan payoffs  million represented loans transferred to other real estate  million consisted of loans brought current and returned to an accrual status  and  was charged off 
where appropriate  management has allocated specific reserves to absorb anticipated losses 
the majority of the company s charge offs in were in the consumer portfolio where loans are charged off based on past due status and are not recorded as nonaccruing loans 
all nonaccrual loans exceeding  not secured by family residential properties are reviewed quarterly for impairment 
a loan is considered impaired when it is probable that all principal and interest will not be collected according to the contractual terms 
when a loan is considered impaired  it is reviewed for exposure to credit loss 
if credit loss is probable  a specific reserve is allocated to absorb the anticipated loss

cash collected on nonaccrual loans is applied against the principal balance or recognized as interest income based upon management s expectations as to the ultimate collectibility of principal and interest in full

the building was under contract at year end  and was subsequently sold with no loss of principal 
potential problem loans are defined as those loans which are now current but where management has doubt as to the borrower s ability to comply with present loan repayment terms 
potential problem loans totaled million at december  loans past due days or more totaled  at year end  down from million from the previous year 
this is primarily the result of the payoff of one loan  and one other loan being brought current 
loan concentrations are considered to exist when there are amounts loaned to a multiple number of borrowers engaged in similar activities which cause them to be similarly impacted by economic or other conditions and such amount exceeds of total loans 
due to the lack of diversified industry within the markets served by the bank and the relatively close proximity of the markets  the company has both geographic concentrations as well as concentrations in the types of loans funded 
specifically  due to the nature of the company s markets  a significant portion of the portfolio has historically been secured with real estate 
while the company has a majority of its loans secured by real estate  the primary type of real estate collateral is family residential properties 
at december   approximately of the portfolio consisted of real estate loans 
residential properties comprise approximately of the real estate portfolio 
the real estate portfolio  while subject to cyclical pressures  is not typically speculative in nature and is originated at amounts that are within or below regulatory guidelines for collateral values 
management anticipates no significant reduction in the percentage of real estate loans to total loans outstanding 
management is continually analyzing its loan portfolio in an effort to identify and resolve its problem assets as quickly and efficiently as possible 
as of december   management believes it has identified and adequately reserved for such problem assets 
however  management recognizes that many factors can adversely impact various segments of its markets  creating financial difficulties for certain borrowers 
as such  management continues to focus its attention on promptly identifying and providing for potential losses as they arise 
investment securities in  the company s average investment portfolio decreased million  or  from and million  or  from compared to as a percentage of average earning assets  the investment portfolio represented in  compared to in in both years  the decline in the portfolio was attributable to the maturities of investment securities in most categories  which in anticipation of future loan growth  were not replaced during the period 
in  the company will closely monitor liquidity levels to determine if the company should purchase additional investments 
in  average taxable investments decreased million  or  while tax exempt investments decreased million  or 
although the tax reform act of significantly reduced the tax benefits associated with tax exempt securities  management will continue to purchase bank qualified municipal issues when it considers the yield to be attractive and the company can do so without adversely impacting its tax position 
as of december   the company may purchase additional tax exempt securities without adverse tax consequences 
the investment portfolio is a significant component of the company s operations and  as such  it functions as a key element of liquidity and asset liability management 
as of december   all securities are classified as available for sale 
classifying securities as available for sale offers management full flexibility in managing its liquidity and interest rate sensitivity without adversely impacting its regulatory capital levels 
securities in the available for sale portfolio are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses associated with these securities recorded  net of tax  in the accumulated other comprehensive income loss component of shareowners equity 
at december   shareowners equity included a net unrealized gain of million  compared to a gain of million at december  it is neither management s intent nor practice to participate in the trading of investment securities for the purpose of recognizing gains and therefore the company does not maintain a trading portfolio

this was partially offset by the continued decline in certificates of deposit 
average certificates of deposit as a percent of average total deposits have declined from in to in this was primarily a result of increased competition and the relative low level of interest rates

as of december   the company had a million credit facility under which all the funds were currently available 
the facility offers the company an unsecured  revolving line of credit that matures in may at which time renewal terms will be negotiated 
upon expiration of the revolving line of credit  the outstanding balance may be converted to a term loan and repaid over a period of seven years 
the term loan is to be secured by stock of the subsidiary bank equal to at least of the principal balance of the term loan 
the company  at its option  may select from various loan rates including prime  libor or the lenders cost of funds rate cof  plus or minus increments thereof 
the libor or cof rates may be fixed for a period of up to six months 
the company also has the option to select fixed rates for periods of one through five years 
as of december   the company did not have any debt outstanding on the line of credit 
the company s credit facility imposes certain limitations on the level of the company s equity capital  and federal and state regulatory agencies have established regulations which govern the payment of dividends to a bank holding company by its bank subsidiaries 
as of year end  the company was in compliance with all of these contractual and or regulatory requirements 
a further discussion of the company s credit facility can be found in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
at december   the company had million in long term debt outstanding to the federal home loan bank of atlanta 
the debt consists of loans 
the interest rates are fixed and the weighted average rate at december  was 
required annual principal reductions approximate million  with the remaining balances due at maturity ranging from to during  the company reclassified million  consisting of two advances from the federal home loan bank of atlanta  from long term to short term debt 
additions to long term debt consists of approximately million used to match fund longer term  fixed rate loan products  which management elected not to fund internally due to asset liability management considerations 
the debt is secured by family residential mortgage loans 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information as to the company s long term debt 
it is anticipated that capital expenditures will approximate million over the next twelve months 
these capital expenditures are expected to consist primarily of several new offices in existing markets  office equipment and furniture  and technology purchases 
management believes these capital expenditures can be funded internally without impairing the company s ability to meet its on going obligations

the ratio of shareowners equity to total assets at year end was  and  in  and  respectively 
the company is subject to risk based capital guidelines that measure capital relative to risk weighted assets and off balance sheet financial instruments 
capital guidelines issued by the federal reserve board require bank holding companies to have a minimum total risk based capital ratio of  with at least half of the total capital in the form of tier capital 
as of december   the company exceeded these capital guidelines with a total risk based capital ratio of and a tier ratio of  compared to and  respectively  in in addition  a tangible leverage ratio is now being used in connection with the risk based capital standards and is defined as tier capital divided by average assets 
the minimum leverage ratio under this standard is for the highest rated bank holding companies which are not undertaking significant expansion programs

in   shares  valued at approximately  were issued under these plans 
dividends adequate capital and financial strength is paramount to the stability of the company and its subsidiary bank 
cash dividends declared and paid should not place unnecessary strain on the company s capital levels 
when determining the level of dividends the following factors are considered compliance with state and federal laws and regulations  the company s capital position and its ability to meet its financial obligations  projected earnings and asset levels  and the ability of the bank and ccbg to fund dividends 
although a consistent dividend payment is believed to be favorably viewed by the financial markets and shareowners  the board of directors will declare dividends only if the company is considered to have adequate capital 
future capital requirements and corporate plans are considered when the board considers a dividend payment

certain merchant clients of one iso have alleged they are entitled to receive financial reserves placed with the iso 
the bank is currently named as a co defendant in two lawsuits brought against the iso by merchants 
management does not believe that the ultimate resolution of these lawsuits will have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
the bank no longer maintains merchant service relationships with isos 
off balance sheet arrangements the company does not currently engage in the use of derivative instruments to hedge interest rate risks 
however  the company is a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risks in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers 
at december   the company had million in commitments to extend credit and million in standby letters of credit 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer so long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
the company uses the same credit policies in establishing commitments and issuing letters of credit as it does for on balance sheet instruments 
if commitments arising from these financial instruments continue to require funding at historical levels  management does not anticipate that such funding will adversely impact its ability to meet on going obligations 
in the event these commitments require funding in excess of historical levels  management believes current liquidity  available lines of credit from the federal home loan bank  investment security maturities and the company s million credit facility provide a sufficient source of funds to meet these commitments 
accounting policies critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require the company to make various estimates and assumptions see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that  of its significant accounting policies  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is established through a charge to the provision for loan losses 
provisions are made to reserve for estimated losses in loan balances 
the allowance for loan losses is a significant estimate and is evaluated quarterly by the company for adequacy 
the use of different estimates or assumptions could produce a different required allowance  and thereby a larger or smaller provision recognized as expense in any given reporting period 
a further discussion of the allowance for loan losses can be found in the section entitled allowance for loan losses and note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
intangible assets intangible assets consist primarily of goodwill and core deposit assets that were recognized in connection with various acquisitions 
goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquired businesses over the fair market value of their identifiable net assets 
the company performs an impairment review on an annual basis to determine if there has been impairment of its goodwill 
the company has determined that no impairment existed at december  impairment testing requires management to make significant judgments and estimates relating to the fair value of its identified reporting units 
significant changes to these estimates may have a material impact on the company s reported results 
core deposit assets represent the premium the company paid for core deposits 
core deposit intangibles are amortized on the straight line method over various periods ranging from years  with the majority being amortized over approximately years 
generally  core deposits refer to nonpublic  nonmaturing deposits including noninterest bearing deposits  now  money market and savings 
the company makes certain estimates relating to the useful life of these assets  and rate of run off based on the nature of the specific assets and the customer bases acquired 
if there is a reason to believe there has been a permanent loss in value  management will assess these assets for impairment 
any changes in the original estimates may materially affect reported earnings 
pension assumptions the company has a trusteed defined benefit pension plan for the benefit of substantially all employees of the company and its subsidiary 
the company s funding policy with respect to the pension plan is to contribute amounts to the plan sufficient to meet minimum funding requirements as set by law 
pension expense  reflected in the consolidated statements of income in noninterest expense as salaries and associate benefits  is determined by an external actuarial valuation based on assumptions that are evaluated annually as of december  the measurement date for the pension obligation 
the consolidated balance sheets reflect a prepaid pension benefit cost due to funding levels and unrecognized actuarial amounts 
the most significant assumptions used in calculating the pension obligation are the weighted average discount rate used to determine the present value of the pension obligation  the weighted average expected long term rate of return on plan assets  and the assumed rate of annual compensation increases 
these assumptions are re evaluated annually with the external actuaries  taking into consideration both current market conditions and anticipated long term market conditions 
the weighted average discount rate is determined by matching anticipated retirement plan cash flows for a year period to long term corporate aa rated bonds and solving for the underlying rate of return which investing in such securities would generate 
this methodology is applied consistently from year to year 
the discount rate utilized in was 
the estimated impact to pension expense of a basis point increase or decrease in the discount rate would have been a decrease of approximately  and an increase of approximately  respectively 
the discount rate to be used in will be 
the weighted average expected long term rate of return on plan assets is determined based on the current and anticipated future mix of assets in the plan

the interpretation also requires the recognition of a liability by a guarantor at the inception of certain guarantees 
fin requires the guarantor to recognize a liability for the non contingent component of the guarantee  this is the obligation to stand ready to perform in the event that specified triggering events or conditions occur 
the initial measurement of this liability is the fair value of the guarantee at inception 
the recognition of the liability is required even it is not probable that payments will be required under the guarantee or if the guarantee was issued with a premium payment or as part of a transaction with multiple elements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk overview market risk management arises from changes in interest rates  exchange rates  commodity prices  and equity prices 
the company has risk management policies to monitor and limit exposure to market risk and does not participate in activities that give rise to significant market risk involving exchange rates  commodity prices  or equity prices 
in asset and liability management activities  policies are in place that are designed to minimize structural interest rate risk 
interest rate risk management the normal course of business activity exposes ccbg to interest rate risk 
fluctuations in interest rates may result in changes in the fair market value of the company s financial instruments  cash flows and net interest income 
the company seeks to avoid fluctuations in its net interest margin and to maximize net interest income within acceptable levels of risk through periods of changing interest rates 
accordingly  the company s interest rate sensitivity and liquidity are monitored on an ongoing basis by its asset and liability committee alco  which oversees market risk management and establishes risk measures  limits and policy guidelines for managing the amount of interest rate risk and its effects on net interest income and capital 
a variety of measures are used to provide for a comprehensive view of the magnitude of interest rate risk  the distribution of risk  the level of risk over time and the exposure to changes in certain interest rate relationships 
alco continuously monitors and manages the balance between interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
alco s objective is to manage the impact of fluctuating market rates on net interest income within acceptable levels 
in order to meet this objective  management may adjust the rates charged paid on loans deposits or may shorten lengthen the duration of assets or liabilities within the parameters set by alco 
the financial assets and liabilities of the company are classified as other than trading 
an analysis of the other than trading financial components  including the fair values  are presented in table this table presents the company s consolidated interest rate sensitivity position as of year end based upon certain assumptions as set forth in the notes to the table 
the objective of interest rate sensitivity analysis is to measure the impact on the company s net interest income due to fluctuations in interest rates 
the asset and liability values presented in table may not necessarily be indicative of the company s interest rate sensitivity over an extended period of time 
the company expects rising rates to have a favorable impact on the net interest margin  subject to the magnitude and timeframe over which the rate changes occur 
however  as general interest rates rise or fall  other factors such as current market conditions and competition may impact how the company responds to changing rates and thus impact the magnitude of change in net interest income 
nonmaturity deposits offer management greater discretion as to the direction  timing  and magnitude of interest rate changes and can have a material impact on the company s interest rate sensitivity 
in addition  the relative level of interest rates as compared to the current yields rates of existing assets liabilities can impact both the direction and magnitude of the change in net interest margin as rates rise and fall from one period to the next 
inflation the impact of inflation on the banking industry differs significantly from that of other industries in which a large portion of total resources are invested in fixed assets such as property  plant and equipment 
assets and liabilities of financial institutions are virtually all monetary in nature  and therefore are primarily impacted by interest rates rather than changing prices 
while the general level of inflation underlies most interest rates  interest rates react more to changes in the expected rate of inflation and to changes in monetary and fiscal policy 
net interest income and the interest rate spread are good measures of the company s ability to react to changing interest rates and are discussed in further detail in the section entitled earnings analysis
