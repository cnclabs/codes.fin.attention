companies that effectively communicate  collaborate and integrate with their trading partners within the extended enterprise or supply chain can realize significant competitive advantages in the form of lower costs  greater customer responsiveness  and increased revenue 
supply chain management refers to the process of managing the complex network of relationships that organizations maintain with external trading partners to source  manufacture and deliver goods and services to the end consumer 
supply chain management involves both the activities related to supplying products or services source  make  move  buy  store  and deliver as well as the sales and marketing activities that impact the demand for goods and services  such as new product introductions  promotions  pricing and forecasting 
today  several market trends are driving organizations to expand collaboration with trading partners along the supply chain 
a general shift in market power has forced manufacturers and distributors to become more responsive to retailers and consumers  which has increased the demand for improved planning capabilities 
at the same time  global economic conditions and competitive pressures are forcing manufacturers to reduce costs  
table of contents decrease order cycle times and improve operating efficiencies 
as a result  manufacturers  distributors and retailers are increasingly under pressure to better manage the supply chain as they seek to improve manufacturing efficiency and logistics operations while maintaining flexibility and responsiveness to changing market conditions and specific customer demands 
these pressures are compounded by the increasing complexity and globalization of the interactions among suppliers  manufacturers  distributors  retailers and consumers

logility has a number of marketing alliances  including those with ibm and ssa global technologies 
generally  these marketing alliance agreements provide the vendors with non exclusive rights to market its products and access to its marketing materials and product training 
some highlights of these agreements are as follows ibm logility entered into an agreement with ibm in pursuant to which logility modified its supply chain products  with ibm s technical and financial assistance  to operate with ibm s eserver iseries as platform 
also  logility agreed to market and support the ibm compatible supply chain products that resulted from our efforts 
ibm may also market our supply chain products and refer potential customers to logility 
ssa global technologies in november  logility granted ssa global technologies ssa a worldwide  non exclusive license to name  package  market  distribute and supply the logility voyager solutions suite as bpcs collaborative commerce powered by logility 
in exchange  ssa agreed to use all reasonable efforts to promote and sell the software 
this agreement had an original expiration date of april   but is automatically extended for additional one year periods  unless either party terminates the agreement by giving days written notice 
in fiscal  logility and ssa amended this agreement to provide for a one time minimum net license fee commitment of million which was paid to logility during fiscal year the status of this amendment is currently being negotiated 
in addition to these marketing alliances  we have developed a network of international agents who assist in selling our products in countries 
we intend to utilize these and future relationships with software and service organizations to enhance our sales and marketing position 
these independent distributors and resellers  located in europe and the asia pacific region  distribute our product lines in foreign countries 
these vendors typically sell their own consulting and systems integration services in conjunction with licensing our products 
to support our direct sales force  we conduct marketing programs that include public relations  direct marketing  advertising  trade shows  product seminars  industry speakers  user group conferences and ongoing customer communication programs 
the price for our products typically is a function of the number of modules licensed and the number of servers  users and sites for which the solution is designed 
during the fiscal year ended april   license fees generally ranged from approximately  to  
table of contents licenses like many business application software firms  we typically enter into license agreements that grant non exclusive rights to use our products 
our standard license agreements contain provisions designed to prevent disclosure and unauthorized use of our software 
these agreements warrant that our products will function in accordance with the specifications set forth in our product documentation 
these licenses generally limit the use of the software to a specific number of individual users and servers for a one time fee 
a significant portion of the license fee is generally payable upon the delivery of product documentation  with the balance due upon installation 
services and support we provide the following services and support to our customers implementation support expressroi sm 
we offer our customers a professional and proven implementation program that facilitates rapid implementation of our software products 
logility consultants  through the expressroi program  help logility customers define the nature of their project  and subsequently proceed through the implementation process 
we provide training for all users and managers involved

implementation general training services 
we offer our customers post delivery professional services consisting primarily of implementation and training services  for which we typically charge on a daily basis 
customers that purchase implementation services receive assistance in integrating our solution with existing software applications and databases 
product maintenance and updates support services 
we provide our customers with ongoing product support services 
typically  we enter into support or maintenance contracts with customers for an initial one to three year term  billed annually in advance  at the time of the product license with renewal for additional periods thereafter 
under these contracts  we provide telephone consulting  product updates and releases of new versions of products previously purchased by the customer  as well as error reporting and correction services

these combined categories totaled  in fiscal   in fiscal  and  in fiscal  and represented of total revenues in fiscal  of total revenues in fiscal  and of total revenues in fiscal we believe that our future success depends in part upon our ability to continue to enhance existing products  respond to changing customer requirements  develop and introduce new or enhanced products  and keep pace with technological developments and emerging industry standards 
we focus our development efforts on several areas  including  but not limited to  enhancing operability of our products across distributed and changing heterogeneous hardware platforms  operating systems and relational databases  and adding functionality to existing products 
these development efforts will continue to focus on deploying applications within a multi tiered supply chain environment  including the internet 

table of contents we believe that our client server and internet based solutions  which utilize the latest technologies  will be important for our long term growth 
as of april   we employed persons in product research  development and enhancement activities 
competition our competitors are diverse and offer a variety of solutions directed at various aspects of the supply chain  as well as the enterprise application market as a whole 
our existing competitors include large enterprise resource planning erp application software vendors such as sap  peoplesoft  and oracle  each of which currently offers sophisticated erp solutions that currently  or may in the future  incorporate supply chain management modules  advanced planning and scheduling  warehouse management  transportation or collaboration software  vendors focusing on the supply chain application software market  such as i technologies and manugistics  other business application software vendors that may broaden their product offerings by internally developing  or by acquiring or partnering with independent developers of supply chain management software  and internal development efforts by corporate information technology departments 
in addition  our logility subsidiary may face competition from other application software vendors  including erp vendors that from time to time jointly market logility s products as a complement to their own systems 
to the extent such vendors develop or acquire systems with functionality comparable to logility s products  their significant installed customer base  long standing customer relationships and ability to offer a broad solution could provide a competitive advantage over logility s products 
we also expect to face additional competition as other established and emerging companies enter the market for collaborative commerce and supply chain management software and new products and technologies are introduced 
in addition  current and potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties  thereby increasing the ability of their products to address the needs of our prospective customers 
accordingly  it is possible that new competitors or alliances among current and new competitors may emerge and rapidly gain significant market share 
increased competition could result in fewer customer orders  reduced gross margins and loss of market share 
many of our competitors and potential competitors have a broader worldwide presence  longer operating histories  significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources  greater name recognition  and a larger installed base of customers than we have 
some competitors have become more aggressive with their prices  payment terms and issuance of contractual implementation terms or guarantees 
in order to be successful in the future  we must continue to develop innovative software solutions and respond promptly and effectively to technological change and competitors innovations 
we may also have to lower prices or offer other favorable terms 
our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products 
the principal competitive factors affecting the market for our products include vendor and product reputation  product architecture  functionality and features  costs  ease and speed of implementation  return on investment  product quality  price and performance  and level of support 
proprietary rights and licenses our success and ability to compete are dependent in part upon our proprietary technology 
to protect our proprietary technology  we rely on a combination of copyright and trade secret laws  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions  which may afford only limited protection 
in addition  effective copyright and trade 
table of contents secret protection may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries 
although we rely on the limited protection afforded by such confidential and contractual procedures and intellectual property laws  we also believe that factors such as the knowledge  ability  and experience of our personnel  new product developments  frequent product enhancements  reliable maintenance and timeliness and quality of support services are essential to establishing and maintaining a technology leadership position 
we presently have no patents or patent applications pending 
the source code for our proprietary software is protected as a trade secret and as a copyrighted work 
generally copyrights on our products expire years after the year of first publication of each product 
we enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees  consultants and customers  and control access to and distribution of our software  documentation and other proprietary information 
in addition  we have registered certain trademarks and have registration applications pending for other trademarks 
we provide our software products to customers under non exclusive license agreements 
as is customary in the software industry  in order to protect our intellectual property rights  we do not sell or transfer title to our products to our customers 
although the license agreements place restrictions on the customer s use of our products  unauthorized use of our products nevertheless may occur 
despite measures we have taken to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to reverse engineer or copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult and expensive 
in addition  litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets  to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others  or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity 
such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
in the future  we may increasingly be subject to claims of intellectual property infringement as the number of products and competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps 
although we are not aware that any of our products infringe upon the proprietary rights of third parties  there can be no assurance that third parties will not claim infringement by us with respect to current or future products 
in addition  we may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights 
any such claims against us  with or without merit  as well as claims initiated by us against third parties  can be time consuming and expensive to defend  prosecute or resolve 
moreover  an adverse outcome in litigation or similar adversarial proceedings could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties  require the expenditure of significant resources to develop non infringing technology  require a substantial amount of attention from management  require disputed rights to be licensed from others  require us to enter into royalty arrangements or require us to cease the marketing or use of certain products  any of which would have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
to the extent that we desire or are required to obtain licenses to patents or proprietary rights of others  there can be no assurance that any such licenses will be made available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
we have relicensed  and expect in the future to relicense  certain software from third parties for use in connection with our products 
there can be no assurance that these third party software vendors will not change their product offerings or that these software licenses will continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
the termination of any such licenses or product offerings  or the failure of the third party licensors to adequately maintain or update their products  could result in delays in our ability to ship certain of our products while we seek to implement technology offered by alternative sources 
any required replacement licenses could prove costly 
further  any such delay  if it becomes extended  could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations
