table of contents effective tax rate nvr s consolidated effective tax rates were   and in   and  respectively 
the lower effective tax rate in was primarily due to the amendment of a long term cash incentive plan requiring executive officers to defer receipt of payments due under the plan until separation of service with nvr 
the effect of this amendment converted compensation expensed prior to january  from a permanent tax difference to a temporary tax difference  producing an approximate  deferred tax benefit 
recent accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin requires the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity vie to consolidate that entity 
the primary beneficiary of a vie is the party that absorbs a majority of the vie s expected losses  receives a majority of the entity s expected residual returns  or both  as a result of ownership  contractual or other financial interests in the entity 
prior to the issuance of fin  an enterprise generally consolidated an entity when the enterprise had a controlling financial interest in the entity through ownership of a majority voting interest 
in december  fasb revised fin fin r  deferring the application of the provisions of fin for an interest held in a vie or potential vie until the end of the first interim or annual period ending after march  if the public entity has not issued financial statements reporting that vie in accordance with fin during the period from february  through september   nvr had entered into fixed priced purchase agreements with an aggregate purchase price of approximately  by making or committing to make  deposits of approximately  nvr has evaluated all fixed price purchase agreements entered into during that period and has determined that it is the primary beneficiary of certain of the variable interest entities with which it has entered into purchase agreements 
nvr estimated the current fair value of the land underlying these purchase agreements and consolidated that amount and a related liability 
the liability represents the difference between the estimated current fair value of the land under contract and nvr s related deposits 
the effect of the consolidation at december  was the inclusion on the balance sheet of  to inventory not owned  consolidated per fin with a corresponding inclusion of  to liabilities related to inventory not owned  consolidated per fin nvr does not have access to the financial records of the development entities with which it enters into fixed price purchase agreements  and as a result was unable to consolidate the variable interest entities results of operations or cash flows 
nvr has deferred implementation of fin on all other fixed price purchase agreements until the first quarter of as permitted under revised fin liquidity and capital resources lines of credit and notes payable nvr s homebuilding segment generally provides for its working capital cash requirements using cash generated from operations and a short term unsecured working capital revolving credit facility

amounts outstanding thereunder accrue interest at various rates tied to the libor rate and are collateralized by gestation mortgage backed securities and whole loans 
the weighted average interest rate for amounts outstanding under this uncommitted facility was during there were no borrowings outstanding under the gestation and repurchase agreement at december  on january   nvr filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission for the issuance of up to  of nvr s debt securities 
the shelf registration statement was declared effective on february  and provides that securities may be offered from time to time in one or more series  and in the form of senior or subordinated debt 
nvr has  available for issuance under the shelf registration 
on june   nvr completed an offering  at par  for  of senior notes due the notes under the shelf registration 
the offering of the notes resulted in aggregate net proceeds of approximately  after deducting offering expenses 
the notes mature on june  and bear interest at  payable semi annually in arrears on june and december  commencing on december  the notes are general unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of nvr s existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness and indebtedness under our existing credit facility 
the notes are senior in right of payment to any future subordinated indebtedness that nvr may incur 
nvr may redeem the notes  in whole or in part  at any time upon not less than nor more than days notice at a redemption price equal to the greater of a of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed  or b the discounted present value of the remaining scheduled payments of the notes to be redeemed  plus  in each case  accrued and unpaid interest 
on july   nvr used approximately  of the proceeds received from the sale of the notes to redeem all of the  outstanding senior notes due at a price of of the principal amount outstanding  including the payment of accrued interest 
the redemption resulted in a charge to pre tax homebuilding income of  nvr expects to file a new shelf registration in to register up to  for future offer and sale of debt securities  common shares  preferred shares  depositary shares representing preferred shares and warrants 
proceeds received from future offerings issued under this shelf registration are expected to be used for general corporate purposes 
this discussion of nvr s expected new shelf registration does not constitute an offer of any securities for sale 
equity repurchases nvr expects that it will  from time to time  repurchase shares of its common stock  pursuant to repurchase authorizations by the board of directors and subject to the restrictions contained within nvr s debt agreements 
in february  the board of directors approved the repurchase of up to an aggregate of  of nvr s common stock in one or more open market and or privately negotiated transactions 
as of november  nvr had fully utilized the february stock repurchase authorization 
in august  the board of directors approved the repurchase of up to an aggregate of  of nvr s common stock in one or more open market and or privately negotiated transactions

as of february   nvr had repurchased shares of its common stock at an aggregate purchase price of approximately  pursuant to the december repurchase authorization 
cash flows as shown in nvr s consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended december   nvr s operating activities provided cash of  for this period 
cash was provided primarily by homebuilding operations and by the utilization of a tax benefit of  as a result of employee stock option exercises 
the tax benefit on employee stock option exercises was recorded directly to equity and reduced estimated tax payments during the year 
increased homebuilding activity contributed to the increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
additionally  customer deposits have increased  as a result of the aforementioned increase in backlog units and due to an increase in the average deposit collected on those units in as compared to cash was used to fund increases in homebuilding inventory of  excluding the change in inventory not owned  consolidated per fin as discussed previously in recent accounting pronouncements 
additionally  cash was used to make deposits on fixed price purchase agreements with developers to acquire control of finished lots 
nvr controlled approximately  lots at december  net cash provided by investing activities was  for the year ended december   primarily due to proceeds received from the sale of mortgage servicing rights and to principal payments received on mortgage loans held for sale  partially offset by capital spending 
net cash used for financing activities was  for the year ended december  nvr purchased approximately  shares of its common stock in for an aggregate purchase price of  additionally  as noted in the previous section  nvr issued  in notes and used approximately  of the proceeds from this issuance to redeem all of the outstanding senior notes due  including accrued interest 
at december   the homebuilding and mortgage banking segments had restricted cash of  and  respectively  which includes certain customer deposits  mortgagor tax  insurance  completion escrows and other amounts collected at closing which relates to mortgage loans held for sale and to home sales 
nvr believes that internally generated cash and borrowings available under credit facilities will be sufficient to satisfy near and longer term cash requirements for working capital and debt service in both its homebuilding and mortgage banking operations 
off balance sheet arrangements as previously noted in the overview  nvr acquires finished building lots at market prices from various development entities under fixed price purchase agreements 
this lot acquisition strategy reduces the financial requirements and risks associated with direct land ownership and land development 
under these purchase agreements  nvr is typically required to make deposits in the form of cash or letters of credit  which may be forfeited if nvr fails to perform under the agreement 
at december   nvr had entered into purchase agreements with an aggregate purchase price of approximately  by making or committing to make deposits of approximately  in the form of cash and letters of credit 
nvr enters into bond or letter of credit arrangements with local municipalities  government agencies  or land developers to collateralize its obligations under various contracts 
nvr had approximately  of contingent obligations under such agreements as of december  nvr believes it will fulfill its obligations under the related contracts and does not anticipate any losses under these bonds or letters of credit 
in the normal course of business  nvr s mortgage banking segment enters into contractual commitments to extend credit to buyers of single family homes with fixed expiration dates 
the commitments 
table of contents become effective when the borrowers lock in a specified interest rate within time frames established by nvr 
all mortgagors are evaluated for credit worthiness prior to the extension of the commitment 
to mitigate the effect of the interest rate risk inherent in providing rate lock commitments to borrowers  nvr enters into optional or mandatory delivery forward sale contracts to sell whole loans and mortgage backed securities to broker dealers 
the forward sale contracts lock in an interest rate and price for the sale of loans similar to the specific rate lock commitments classified as derivatives 
both the rate lock commitments to borrowers and the forward sale contracts to broker dealers are undesignated derivatives  and accordingly are marked to market through earnings 
at december   there were contractual commitments to extend credit to borrowers aggregating  and open forward delivery sale contracts aggregating  contractual obligations our fixed  noncancelable obligations as of december   were as follows payments due by period total less than year years years more than years debt a capital leases b operating leases c purchase obligations d other long term liabilities e total a amounts are included on the consolidated balance sheets 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding debt and related matters 
b the present value of these obligations is included on the consolidated balance sheets 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding capital lease obligations 
c see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding operating leases 
d amounts represent required payments of forfeitable deposits with land developers under existing fixed price purchase agreements assuming that contractual development milestones are met by the developers 
all payments of these deposits are expected to be made within the next three years but due to the nature of the contractual development milestones that must be met  nvr is unable to accurately estimate the portion of the deposit obligation which will be made within one year and that portion which will be made within one to three years 
in addition to the  to be paid pursuant to the prior discussion  as of december   nvr had capitalized on it consolidated balance sheet  forfeitable deposits for fixed price purchase agreements with developers totaling  e amounts represent payments due under incentive compensation plans and are included on the consolidated balance sheets  approximately  of which is recorded in the mortgage banking accounts payable and other liabilities line item 
approximately  of the total obligation is payable contingent upon vesting related to continued employment 
critical accounting policies general the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
nvr continually evaluates the estimates it uses to prepare the consolidated financial statements  and updates those estimates as necessary 
in general  management s estimates are based on historical experience  on information from third party professionals  and other various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates made by management 

table of contents homebuilding inventory the carrying value of inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market value 
cost of lots and completed and uncompleted housing units represent the accumulated actual cost thereof 
field construction supervisors salaries and related direct overhead expenses are included in inventory costs 
interest costs are not capitalized into inventory 
upon settlement  the cost of the units is expensed on a specific identification basis 
cost of manufacturing materials is determined on a first in  first out basis 
recoverability and impairment  if any  is primarily evaluated by analyzing sales of comparable assets 
management believes that its accounting policy is designed to properly assess the carrying value of homebuilding inventory 
variable interest entities financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  requires the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity to consolidate that entity 
the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity is the party that absorbs a majority of the variable interest entity s expected losses  receives a majority of the entity s expected residual returns  or both  as a result of ownership  contractual  or other financial interests in the entity 
the methodology used to evaluate whether nvr is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity requires substantial management judgment and estimates 
these judgments and estimates involve assigning probabilities to various estimated cash flow possibilities relative to the variable interest entity s expected profits and losses and the cash flows associated with changes in the fair value of finished lots under contract 
the estimates used by management to assess probabilities of various cash flows must be considered in the context that nvr is not in the land development business  does not possess any in house expertise relative to the land development business  and that nvr does not have access to the books and records of most of the development entities evaluated as a variable interest entity 
although management believes that its accounting policy is designed to properly assess nvr s primary beneficiary status relative to its involvement with variable interest entities  changes to the probabilities and the cash flow possibilities used in nvr s evaluation could produce different conclusions regarding nvr s status or non status as a variable interest entity s primary beneficiary 
contract land deposits nvr purchases finished lots under fixed price purchase agreements that require deposits that may be forfeited if nvr fails to perform under the contract 
the deposits are in the form of cash or letters of credit in varying amounts and represent a percentage of the aggregate purchase price of the finished lots 
nvr maintains an allowance for losses on contract land deposits that it believes is sufficient to provide for losses in the existing contract land deposit portfolio 
the allowance reflects management s judgment of the present loss exposure at the end of the reporting period  considering market and economic conditions  sales absorption and profitability within specific communities and terms of the various contracts 
although nvr considers the allowance for losses on contract land deposits reflected on the december  balance sheet to be adequate  there can be no assurance that this allowance will prove to be adequate over time to cover losses due to unanticipated adverse changes in the economy or other events adversely affecting specific markets or the homebuilding industry 
intangible assets reorganization value in excess of identifiable assets excess reorg value and goodwill are no longer subject to amortization upon the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no  goodwill and other intangible assets fas 
rather  excess reorg value and goodwill are subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test 
nvr continually evaluates whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate that the remaining value of excess reorg value and goodwill may not be recoverable 
at december   management believes that excess reorg value and goodwill were not impaired 
this conclusion is based on management s judgment  considering such factors as nvr s history of operating success  nvr s well recognized brand names and the significant positions held in the markets in which nvr operates 
however  changes in strategy or adverse changes in market conditions could impact this judgment and require an impairment loss to be recognized for the amount that the carrying value of excess reorg value and or goodwill exceeds their fair value 

table of contents warranty product liability accruals warranty and product liability accruals are established to provide for estimated future expenses as a result of construction and product defects  product recalls and litigation incidental to nvr s business 
liability estimates are determined based on management judgment considering such factors as historical experience  the likely current cost of corrective action  manufacturers and subcontractors participation in sharing the cost of corrective action  consultations with third party experts such as engineers  and discussions with our general counsel and other outside counsel retained to handle specific product liability cases 
although nvr considers the warranty and product liability accrual reflected on the december  balance sheet see note to be adequate  there can be no assurance that this accrual will prove to be adequate over time to cover losses due to increased costs for material and labor  the inability or refusal of manufacturers or subcontractors to financially participate in corrective action  unanticipated adverse legal settlements  or other unanticipated changes to the assumptions used to estimate the warranty and product liability accrual 
impact of inflation  changing prices and economic conditions see risk factors previously discussed 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
nvr s market risk arises from interest rate risk inherent in its financial instruments 
interest rate risk is the possibility that changes in interest rates will cause unfavorable changes in net income or in the value of interest rate sensitive assets  liabilities and commitments 
lower interest rates tend to increase demand for mortgage loans for home purchasers  while higher interest rates make it more difficult for potential borrowers to purchase residential properties and to qualify for mortgage loans 
nvr has no market rate sensitive instruments held for speculative or trading purposes 
nvr s mortgage banking segment is exposed to interest rate risk as it relates to its lending activities 
the mortgage banking segment originates mortgage loans which are either sold through optional or mandatory forward delivery contracts into the secondary markets 
all of the mortgage banking segment s loan portfolio is held for sale and subject to forward sale commitments 
nvr also sells substantially all of its mortgage servicing rights on a servicing released basis 
nvr s homebuilding segment generates operating liquidity and acquires capital assets through fixed rate and variable rate debt 
the homebuilding segment s primary variable rate debt is a working capital revolving credit facility that currently provides for unsecured borrowings up to  subject to certain borrowing base limitations 
the working capital credit facility expires in august and outstanding amounts bear interest at the election of nvr based on the type of borrowing and other criteria set forth in the facility 
the weighted average interest rate for the amounts outstanding under the facility was during there were no amounts outstanding under the working capital revolving credit facility at december  at december   there were no borrowing base limitations reducing the amount available to nvr for borrowings 
nvrm generates operating liquidity primarily through the mortgage warehouse facility which currently has a borrowing limit of  the interest rate under the mortgage warehouse facility is either i the london interbank offering rate libor plus  or ii to the extent that nvrm provides compensating balances 
the weighted average interest rate for amounts outstanding under the mortgage warehouse facility was during mortgage loans and gestation mortgage backed securities collateralize the mortgage warehouse facility borrowings 
the mortgage warehouse facility is annually renewable and currently expires in august there was  outstanding under the mortgage warehouse facility at december  the mortgage warehouse facility agreement includes  among other items  restrictions on nvrm incurring additional borrowings and making intercompany dividends and tax payments 
in addition  nvrm is required to maintain a minimum net worth of  at december   borrowing base limitations reduced the amount available to nvrm for borrowings to approximately  
table of contents nvrm currently has available an aggregate of  of borrowing capacity in an uncommitted gestation and repurchase agreement 
amounts outstanding thereunder accrue interest at various rates tied to the libor rate and are collateralized by gestation mortgage backed securities and whole loans 
the uncommitted facility generally requires nvrm to  among other items  maintain a minimum net worth and limit its level of liabilities in relation to its net worth 
the weighted average interest rates for amounts outstanding under these uncommitted facilities were and during and  respectively 
there were no borrowings outstanding under the uncommitted gestation and repurchase agreement at december  the following table represents the contractual balances of nvr s on balance sheet financial instruments in dollars at the expected maturity dates  as well as the fair values of those on balance sheet financial instruments  at december  the expected maturity categories take into consideration historical and anticipated prepayment speeds  as well as actual amortization of principal and does not take into consideration the reinvestment of cash or the refinancing of existing indebtedness 
because nvr sells all of the mortgage loans it originates into the secondary markets  nvr has made the assumption that the portfolio of mortgage loans held for sale will mature in the first year 
consequently  outstanding warehouse borrowings and repurchase facilities are also assumed to mature in the first year
