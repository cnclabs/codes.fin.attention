overview cubist is a biopharmaceutical company primarily located in the us  focused on becoming a leader in the research  development and commercialization of products that address unmet medical needs 
to date  we have been exclusively focused on exploiting business and product opportunities in the antiinfective marketplace 
on september   we received approval from the fda to market cubicin in the us for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections  or csss infections  caused by certain gram positive bacteria 
in the first week of november  we launched cubicin in the us and began filling and shipping orders to hospitals 
in the fourth quarter of  we signed an international commercialization agreement with chiron for the development and commercialization of cubicin in western and eastern europe  australia  new zealand  india and certain central american  south american and middle eastern countries 
as we work to expand our launch of cubicin into these and other significant markets  we expect our product revenues as well as the related cost of sales and sales and marketing expenses to increase 
in addition to our launch of cubicin  in we focused on improving our operating efficiencies and costs  as well as restructuring our balance sheet by addressing our long term commitments 
during the year  we made the decision to close our uk research facility and consolidate our discovery activities in the us and to transfer as many of our scientists who wish to relocate from the uk to our lexington  ma facility by september restructuring our operations resulted in certain one time expenses such as the million charge to buy out our lease in slough  england  as well as the potential future costs to relocate employees accepting a transfer to the us in we expect that this decision will allow us to better position ourselves to develop new products while also reducing operating costs over time 
in december  we paid down million of our million senior convertible notes with john hancock 
we may continue to reduce our debt obligations under the notes as we seek to restructure the remaining principal balance of million 
we have incurred net losses since our inception  principally as a result of research and development efforts  pre clinical testing and clinical trials 
as of december  we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future as we continue our investments in sales and marketing activities related to the launch of cubicin as well as research and development for other drug products with potential commercial viability 
results of operations years ended december  and revenues the following table sets forth and revenues together with the percentage change in revenues from year to year december  change in millions product revenues  net license fee revenues collaborative agreement and other revenues total revenues product revenues  net the company began shipping cubicin in november net sales of cubicin were million in and accounted for all of the product sales 
gross sales of cubicin totaled million for and are net of  of allowances for sales returns  medicaid rebates  chargebacks and prompt pay discounts 
in order to prevent a one time loading of product upon launch  we did not allow wholesalers to stock cubicin 
we currently have a drop ship program in place through which orders are processed through wholesalers  but shipments are sent directly to our end users 
this results in sales trends closely tracking actual hospital purchases of our product 
as our product revenues are only for the last two months of  we expect higher product sales in our product revenues in the future may be impacted by increases or decreases in wholesaler inventories if we move away from this drop ship program 
license fee revenues total license fee revenues in the year ended december  were million as compared to million in the year ended december   a decrease of million or 
the decrease in our license revenues from to primarily relates to the mutual termination in september of a european commercialization agreement with gilead sciences  which accounted for million in license fee revenue and million of milestone revenue in and no revenue in in the fourth quarter of  we signed a license agreement with chiron  which included up front payments totaling million  including a million premium paid upon purchasing our common stock 
this million was recorded as deferred revenue and is being amortized to license fee revenues over the estimated development period of the agreement  or two years 
revenue of million was recognized under this agreement during the fourth quarter of the company currently expects to recognize million and million of the up front fee as revenue in and  respectively  assuming no change in our estimated development period 
collaborative agreement and other revenues total collaborative agreement and other revenues in the year ended december  were million as compared to million in the year ended december   a decrease of million or 
the decrease in our collaborative agreement and other revenues from to primarily relates to our completion in february of our research collaboration agreement with novartis under which we recognized  of revenue in as compared to million of revenue in  as well as a decrease in small business innovation research sbir grants received in versus operating expenses the following table sets forth and operating expenses together with the percentage change in operating expenses from year to year december  change in millions cost of product revenues research and development sales and marketing general and administrative total operating expense cost of product revenues cost of product revenues were  in as compared with no cost of product revenues in as cubicin was launched in november our gross margin for was 
since we began commercial sale of cubicin late in  there is the potential for our gross margin to increase as product production volume increases and as we work to develop manufacturing process improvements 
included in our cost of product revenues are royalties owed to eli lilly on net sales of cubicin under our license agreement with eli lilly 
research and development expense total research and development expense in the year ended december   was million compared to million in the year ended december   a decrease of million or 
the decrease from to primarily related to a decrease of million in clinical study costs related to cubicin development that were incurred in and not in  decrease in license fee expense of million  and a decrease in lab services and supplies of million partially offset by i million of costs related to the development of the manufacturing process for cubicin and ii million of milestone expense to sandoz for completion of a cab dosing study in humans 
our research and development costs primarily consist of salaries  benefits and other head count related costs  clinical trial and related clinical manufacturing costs  contract and other outside service fees  quality assurance  quality control  medical affairs and the development of a manufacturing process for cubicin 
we expect our research costs to remain steady in with increased development costs as we enter into phase v clinical trials for cubicin and as we work with acs to ensure that their manufacturing facility complies with gmp standards to manufacture cubicin 
in february  we discontinued clinical development of cab due to observed adverse events and are currently assessing other pipeline opportunities 
sales and marketing expense sales and marketing expenses in the year ended december  were million compared to million in the year ended december   an increase of million or 
the increase in sales and marketing expenses relates to an increase of million in salary and benefits expense primarily due to the addition of employees and regional business directors for our cubicin sales force  and million in costs for advertising  promotions and medical education related to the cubicin product launch 
we expect our sales and marketing expense to increase in as we will have a full year of sales force costs as well as promotion expenses for cubicin 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expenses in the year ended december   were million compared to million in the year ended december   an increase of million or 
the increase primarily relates to lease termination charges of million recorded in the third and fourth quarters of stemming from our decision in september to consolidate our discovery activities in our lexington  ma facility 
the charge includes the cost to buy out our slough  england lease  and we expect that there could be additional costs in the future to related to our relocation of certain scientists to our lexington facility by the third quarter of future cost savings as a result of this consolidation may offset these charges 
also included in general and administrative expenses are costs of approximately  related to the termination of employment of two former executive officers during other expense  net the following table sets forth and other expenses together with the percentage change in other expenses from year to year december  change in millions interest income interest expense other expense total other expense  net interest income and expense interest income in the year ended december  was million compared to million in the year ended december   a decrease of million or 
the decrease in interest income was due to the decrease throughout the year of our cash and cash equivalents balance as well as lower average yields on our investments 
interest expense in the year ended december  was million as compared to million during the year ended december   a decrease of million or 
the decrease in interest expense from to was the result of our initiative to restructure our balance sheet and improve our capital structure 
we repaid our original term loan and entered into a new term loan with a lower average balance in versus interest expense related to our subordinated convertible notes due was approximately million in interest expense related to our senior convertible notes due in was approximately million in  with the million pay down of debt in december  interest expense on these notes will be approximately million per year 
as we continue to work to reduce our outstanding debt balance  we expect our interest expense to decrease proportionately  provided that interest rates remain stable 
other expense other expense in the year ended december  was million compared to million in the year ended december   an increase of million or 
included in other expense is a foreign exchange translation loss of million primarily related to the remeasurement of the slough lease termination accrual that is denominated in british pounds and an impairment loss of  recorded in the first quarter of on our investment in syrrx based upon the pricing of a round of financing that syrrx completed in the first quarter of in  our canadian subsidiary was liquidated into  and all remaining assets were transferred to  cubist pharmaceuticals  inc us a foreign exchange loss of  relating to the liquidation of these subsidiaries was taken during years ended december  and revenues the following table sets forth and revenues together with the percentage change in revenues from year to year december  change in millions novartis gilead sciences grants total revenues total revenues in the year ended december  were million compared to million in the year ended december   a decrease of million or

the revenues earned in the year ended december  consisted primarily of million in license fee revenues and million in milestone revenues from gilead  million in research support funding and  in milestone payments from the novartis collaboration   in sbir funding   in license maintenance fees and  in research support funding 
the decrease in revenues in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  was primarily due to the decrease in license fees and milestones recognized as revenue from gilead 
in september  cubist and gilead jointly announced the dissolution of their licensing agreement 
operating expenses the following table sets forth and operating expenses together with the percentage change in operating expenses from year to year december  change in millions research and development sales and marketing general and administrative total operating expense research and development expense total research and development expense in the year ended december  was million compared to million in the year ended december   a decrease of million or 
the decrease was largely due to the completion and closure of cubist s community acquired pneumonia phase clinical trials for cubicin 
during  based upon current information received from each clinical research organization  or cro  the company reversed previously recorded accrued clinical trial expense of million by crediting research and development expense 
while cubist does not currently maintain cost accounting systems to specifically track costs on an individual project basis  in  based on an estimated average full time equivalent basis  the company incurred estimated costs of million in connection with all of its research collaborations  which generated approximately million of revenue in in  based on an estimated average full time equivalent basis  cubist incurred estimated costs of million in connection with all of its research collaborations  which generated approximately million of revenue in general and administrative expense general and administrative expenses in the year ended december  were million compared to million in the year ended december   a decrease of million or 
other income expense  net the following table sets forth and other expenses together with the percentage change in other income expense from year to year december  change in millions interest income interest expense other income expense total other income expense  net interest income and expense interest income in the year ended december   was million compared to million in the year ended december   a decrease of million or 
the decrease in interest income was due to lower average cash  cash equivalents and investment balances during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   and significantly lower interest rates 
interest expense in the year ended december  was million as compared to million during the year ended december   an increase of million or 
the increase in interest expense was primarily due to increased long term debt related to the issuance of convertible subordinated notes in the fourth quarter of other income expense other income expense in the year ended december  was million compared to million in the year ended december   a change of million or 
in  our canadian subsidiary was liquidated into  and all remaining assets were transferred to  cubist pharmaceuticals  inc us a foreign exchange loss of million relating to the liquidation of these subsidiaries was taken during the year 
in  the decision was made to relocate the functions performed at the vancouver operations to cubist s corporate headquarters 
this was considered to represent a substantial reduction of cubist s investment in its canadian subsidiary  therefore the cumulative translation adjustment relating to these operations  which amounted to  was taken to income during the year 
income tax benefit there was no income tax benefit in the year ended december   as compared to  in the year ended december   a decrease of  or 
the elimination of an income tax benefit was due to cubist no longer qualifying for investment tax credits for increased research and development expenditures related to cubist s canadian operations 
liquidity and capital resources currently  we require cash to fund our working capital needs  to purchase capital assets  and to pay our debt service  including principal  interest and capital lease obligations 
historically  we have funded our cash requirements through the following methods payments from our strategic collaborators including license fees  sponsored research funding and research grants  equity and debt financings  equipment financings  and interest earned on invested capital 
in the future  we expect to continue to fund our cash requirements from these sources as well as from sales of cubicin 
we anticipate sustained cash outflows in the next few years relating to the continued development and commercialization of cubicin  the continued development of our other drug candidates  as well as investments in other product opportunities 
net cash used in operating activities was million in  million in and million in although net loss increased million in as compared to  net cash used for operating activities only increased million in as compared to this is primarily due to i increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of million primarily due to the agreement to buy out of our lease in slough  england and ii million of cash provided by deferred revenue primarily due to the up front payment of million from chiron 
these increases in cash were offset by uses of cash as a result of accounts receivable and inventory due to our launch of cubicin as well as our focus on the development of a manufacturing process for cubicin and the development of our cubicin sales force 
our investing activities have consisted of capital expenditures and strategic investments 
purchases of property and equipment during the year ended december  were million as compared to million and million in the years ended december  and  respectively 
in we expended million for computer hardware and software primarily related to development of a sales automation system 
during  we expended million for lab equipment and million for computer hardware primarily due to company growth 
in  our fixed asset additions primarily related to the build out of our corporate headquarters in lexington  ma 
in  we plan to invest in updating our it infrastructure  such as our manufacturing  inventory  sales reporting and regulatory record keeping modules as a result of our product launch 
we will also invest in research equipment as we transfer our uk operations to the uk net cash used in investing activities may in the future fluctuate significantly from period to period due to the timing of our capital expenditures and other investments 
net cash of million was provided by financing activities in the year ended december  as compared to  used for financing activities in and million provided in financing activities in the year ended december  in  million of cash that was restricted as of december  became unrestricted due to the repayment of our term loan 
we generated net cash of million from our public offering of shares in in addition  we repaid million of our senior convertible notes related to our building 
net cash used by financing activities in was primarily due to approximately million in repayments of debt with no significant inflows from financings 
net cash provided by financing activities in was primarily due to approximately million of net proceeds from our convertible subordinated notes 
our total cash  cash equivalents and investments at december  was million compared to million  excluding restricted cash  at december  based on the net cash raised from our equity financing of million  and the up front payments and stock purchase provided to us from chiron of million we now believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents  investments and cash flows from revenues will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses  debt obligations  milestone payments under our collaborative agreements and capital requirements under our current business plan through the first half of on march   we filed a shelf registration statement on form s to register the offering on a delayed or continuous basis of million of common stock 
the registration statement became effective on june  on october   we amended the registration statement to increase the aggregate offering price from million to million  resulting in the issuance of approximately  additional shares of common stock  based on a per share offering price of 
on october   we completed the sale of  shares of common stock at per share 
net cash proceeds from this offering were million 
in april  we entered into a term loan agreement with a bank under which we were able to borrow up to million 
advances under this facility are to be repaid over a month period  commencing on june  interest on the borrowings accrues at the bank s libor rate plus a margin of at december  
the outstanding borrowings under this facility totaled million at december  on october   cubist completed the private placement of million of convertible subordinated notes less financing costs of million 
the notes are convertible at any time prior to maturity into common stock at a conversion price of per share  subject to adjustment upon certain events 
on december   the initial purchasers exercised their option to purchase million of convertible subordinated notes less financing costs of million 
interest is payable on each november and may  beginning may  cubist paid million in interest on these notes during and the notes are subordinated to senior indebtedness and mature on november  in  gilead paid cubist million for achieving three development milestones 
in september  cubist and gilead mutually agreed to terminate their licensing agreement 
as a result of the mutual termination  cubist recognized million in milestone revenue and million in remaining deferred license fee revenue 
revenues of million and million were recognized in the years ended and respectively 
there are no future financial obligations relating to this licensing agreement 
cubist issued million of senior convertible notes to john hancock life insurance company to finance the purchase of the company s headquarters 
the five year notes carry a coupon rate of and can be converted at any time at the option of the holder into our common stock at per share 
cubist retains the right to redeem these notes after three years at of their principal amount outstanding 
on december  we repaid million of the senior convertible notes 
commitments contractual obligations our major outstanding contractual obligations relate to convertible notes  a term loan and our facilities leases 
the aggregate outstanding principal of our convertible notes is million as of december  these notes consist of million of convertible subordinated notes due in  and million of senior convertible notes due in both the convertible subordinated notes and the senior convertible notes require semi annual interest payments through maturity 
our uk subsidiary leases  square feet of commercial office and laboratory space in slough  england pursuant to a lease  which we may exit with six months notice to the lessor 
in february  the uk subsidiary entered into a binding letter of intent to lease approximately  square feet of additional space in slough  england  commencing in february for a term of fifteen years 
in september  we decided not to occupy the additional facility or the existing facility beyond the third quarter of in january  we agreed to a buy out of the lease and accordingly  we have recorded an accrual of million  representing our cost to buy out the lease 
payments are due in january and september under this agreement 
the aggregate outstanding amount of the contractual obligations and commercial commitments is million as of december  these obligations and commitments represent maximum payments based on current operating forecasts 
certain of the commitments could be reduced if changes to our operating forecast occur in the future 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  and the effect such obligations and commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in the future periods payments due by period total and thereafter in millions financing obligations senior convertible notes subordinated convertible notes term loan capital lease operating leases total contractual obligations commercial commitments clinical cro costs manufacturing and distribution licenses and collaborations total commercial commitments cubist is party to research and development as well as license agreements for various technologies 
certain of these agreements contain provisions for future royalties to be paid on commercial sales of products developed from the licensed technologies 
this table represents cubist s best estimates of its current minimum obligations and forecasts 
guarantees and indemnification obligations pursuant to article of cubist s amended and restated by laws  cubist has agreed to indemnify any person who is made a party to any action or threatened with any action as a result of such person s serving or having served as an officer or director of cubist or having served  at our request  as an officer or director of another company 
the indemnification does not apply if the person is adjudicated not to have acted in good faith in the reasonable belief that his or her actions were in the best interests of cubist 
the indemnification obligation survives termination of the indemnified party s involvement with cubist but only as to those claims arising from such person s role as an officer or director 
the maximum potential amount of future payments that cubist could be required to make under the by law provision is unlimited  however  we have director and officer insurance policies that  in most cases  would limit our exposure and enable us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid 
in addition  cubist has not incurred any material costs under this indemnification 
the estimated fair value of these indemnification provisions is minimal and accordingly  we have no liabilities recorded for these agreements as of december  cubist typically includes customary indemnification provisions in its agreements with other companies in the ordinary course of business  typically with business partners  contractors  and clinical sites 
under these provisions  cubist generally indemnifies and holds harmless the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party as a result of the company s activities 
these indemnification provisions generally survive termination of the underlying agreement 
the maximum potential amount of future payments cubist could be required to make under these indemnification provisions is unlimited 
cubist has not incurred any material costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification agreements 
as a result  the estimated fair value of these agreements is minimal 
accordingly  the company has no liabilities recorded for these agreements as of december  in december  the holders of our senior convertible notes due in september  waived our obligation to reserve shares of common stock issuable upon the conversion of the senior convertible notes 
therefore  we reduced the number of shares reserved for issuance upon conversion of these notes from  shares of common stock to zero shares of common stock 
at our annual shareholder meeting to be held on june   we will propose to increase the authorized capital stock of the company 
upon approval of such increase  and provided that we have not redeemed all of the senior convertible notes  we will reserve for issuance that number of shares necessary to cover the conversion in full of each note still outstanding on june  if a the reported last sale price of our common stock on the nasdaq national market is greater than at any time prior to the date that we reserve a sufficient amount of shares to cover the conversion in full of the notes and b a holder of our senior convertible notes provides written notice to us that it intends to convert its respective note and sell the shares of common stock to be received upon such conversion  then we agreed to use best efforts to make available a sufficient number of shares of common stock to enable each purchaser to convert its note in full 
if such shares are unavailable for delivery on the date delivery is required under the note  then we agreed to pay to each purchaser that delivered a conversion notice the note proceeds in accordance with the terms of the agreement 
we have determined that it is not probable that our stock price will reach per share by june   therefore  no liabilities were recorded for this agreement as of december  critical accounting policies and estimates cubist prepares its consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the company is required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts and disclosures  actual amounts may differ 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition  inventories  accrued clinical research costs  investments  long lived assets  income taxes 
i 
revenue recognition cubist recognizes revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab as amended by sab  and emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
for all revenue transactions entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  principal sources of revenue are sales of cubicin  license fees and milestone payments  which are derived from collaborative agreements with other biotechnology companies 
we recognize revenue from product sales when the product has been delivered at which point title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  collection from the customer is reasonably assured and we have no further performance obligations 
non refundable license fees are recorded as deferred revenue once received and are recognized ratably over the development period to which they relate 
the relevant time period for the product development phase is based on management estimates and could vary depending on the outcome of clinical trials and the regulatory approval process 
such changes could materially impact the revenue recognized 
as a result  management continually reviews the relevant time period 
revenues from milestone payments related to arrangements under which the company has continuing performance obligations are recognized as revenue upon achievement of the milestone only if all of the following conditions are met the milestone payments are non refundable  achievement of the milestone was not reasonably assured at the inception of the arrangement  substantive effort is involved in achieving the milestone  and the amount of the milestone is reasonable in relation to the effort expended or the risk associated with the achievement of the milestone 
if any of these conditions are not met  the milestone payments are deferred and recognized as revenue over the term of the arrangement as the company completes its performance obligations 
revenues from research funding are recognized when the services are performed in order to match revenues to expenses incurred 
revenues from sbir grants to conduct research and development is recognized as eligible costs are incurred up to the funding limit 
we analyze our multiple element arrangements entered into after june  to determine whether the elements can be separated and accounted for individually as separate units of accounting in accordance with eitf no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
we recognize up front license payments as revenue if the license has standalone value and the fair value of the undelivered items can be determined 
if the license is considered to have standalone value but the fair value on any of the undelivered items cannot be determined  the license payments are recognized as revenue over the period of performance for such undelivered items or services 
we currently have an arrangement which includes an up front license payment as well as requirements for cubist to perform development services and to manufacture and supply drug product 
the pricing for the manufacturing and supply services was determined to be at fair value 
although the license was determined to have standalone value  we could not establish fair value for the development services and  as such  the license and development services are being accounted for as a single unit of accounting 
accordingly  the up front license payment is being recognized over the estimated development period of two years 
our estimate of the development period and our determination that the terms of the manufacturing and supply agreement are at fair value both involve management judgment 
we record reserves for rebates payable under medicaid and discounts under our chargeback agreements as a reduction of revenue at the time product sales are recorded 
our medicaid and chargeback reserves have two components an estimate of outstanding claims for end user sales that have occurred  but for which related claim submissions have not been received  and an estimate of chargebacks based on an analysis of customer data 
because the second component is calculated based on the amount of inventory in the distribution channel  our assessment of distribution channel inventory levels impacts our estimated reserve requirements 
our calculation also requires other estimates  including estimates of sales mix  to determine which sales will be subject to rebates and the amount of such rebates 
we will update our estimates and assumptions each period  and record any necessary adjustment to our reserves 
as of december   our reserve for medicaid and payor rebates was approximately  we record allowances for product returns as a reduction of revenue at the time product sales are recorded 
the product returns reserve is estimated based on industry return rates for similar products 
if the history of product returns changes  the reserve will be adjusted appropriately 
our estimate of distribution channel inventory is also used to assess the reasonableness of our product returns reserve 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate and result in an impairment of their ability to make payments  we would record an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses on those receivables 
ii 
inventories we value inventories at cost or  if lower  fair value 
we determine cost using the first in  first out method 
we analyze our inventory levels quarterly and write down inventory that has become obsolete  inventory that has a cost basis in excess of its expected net realizable value and inventory in excess of expected requirements  to cost of product revenues 
expired inventory is disposed of and the related costs are written off 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
iii 
accrued clinical research costs the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period reported 
specifically  the company s management must make estimates of costs incurred to date  but not yet invoiced by external entities such as cros 
management analyzes the progress of clinical trials  invoices received  and budgeted costs when evaluating the adequacy of the accrued liability 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the accrued balance in any accounting period 
actual results may differ from the amount and timing of the accrued balance for any period 
iv 
investments it is our intent to hold all investments to maturity in accordance with cubist s investment policy 
however  if the circumstances regarding an investment were to change  such as a change in an investment s external credit rating  cubist would consider a sale of the related security to minimize any losses 
the appropriateness of all investment classifications is reviewed at each reporting date 
v 
long lived assets in the ordinary course of our business  we incur substantial costs to purchase and construct property  plant and equipment 
the treatment of costs to purchase or construct these assets depends on the nature of the costs and the stage of construction 
we generally depreciate plant and equipment using the straight line method over the asset s estimated economic life  which ranges from years to years 
determining the economic lives of plant and equipment requires us to make significant judgments that can materially impact our operating results 
property and equipment primarily consists of cubist s corporate headquarters building 
as of december   there were approximately million of net other intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheet  which consisted of patents  intellectual property  acquired technology rights  manufacturing rights  and other intangibles 
we amortize our intangible assets using the straight line method over their estimated economic lives  which range from years to years 
determining the economic lives of intangible assets requires us to make significant judgment and estimates  and can materially impact our operating results 
property and equipment and intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on historical and projected future operating results  changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets  overall business strategy  and market and economic trends 
future events could cause management to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that certain intangibles assets are impaired 
vi 
income taxes cubist records deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the net tax effects of tax credits  operating loss carry forwards  and temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
cubist then assesses the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent that cubist determines that recovery is not likely  a valuation allowance is established 
the valuation allowance is based on estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which cubist operates and the period over which deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
through december   cubist believes it is more likely than not that all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized and  accordingly  has recorded a valuation allowance against substantially all deferred tax assets 
if results of operations in the future indicate that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be recovered  the reduction of the valuation allowance will be recorded as a tax benefit during one or over many periods 
recent accounting pronouncements in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement will be effective in fiscal year for contracts entered into or modified after june  and for hedging relationships designated after june  we do not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
or fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  to expand upon and strengthen existing accounting guidance that addresses when a company should include in its financial statements the assets  liabilities and activities of another entity 
until now  one company generally has included another entity in its consolidated financial statements only if it controlled the entity through voting interests 
fin changes that by requiring a variable interest entity vie  as defined  to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
fin also requires disclosures about variable interest entities that the company is not required to consolidate but in which it has a significant variable interest 
in december  the fasb released a revised version of fin hereafter referred to as fin r clarifying certain aspects of fin and providing certain entities with exemptions from the requirements of fin the variable interest model of fin r was only slightly modified from that contained in fin a vie would be required to be consolidated if either of the following conditions are met the total equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support provided by any parties  including equity holders 
the equity investors lack any one of the following three characteristics of a controlling financial interest the direct or indirect ability through voting rights or similar rights to make decisions about an entity s activities that have a significant effect on the success of the entity 
the obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity 
the right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity 
fin r requires the application of either fin or fin r by public entities to all special purpose entities spes created prior to february  at the end of the first interim or annual reporting period ending after december  all entities created after january  by public entities were already required to be analyzed under fin  and they must continue to do so  unless fin r is adopted early 
fin r will be applicable to all non spes created prior to february  by public entities that are not small business issuers at the end of the first interim or annual reporting period ending after march  the adoption of fin had no effect on our results of operations and financial position 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk cubist is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations 
cubist currently owns financial instruments that are sensitive to market risks as part of its investment portfolio 
the investment portfolio is used to preserve capital until it is required to fund operations 
none of these market risk sensitive instruments is held for trading purposes 
the investment portfolio includes investment grade debt instruments 
these bonds are subject to interest rate risk  and could decline in value if interest rates fluctuate 
due to our policy to hold these instruments to maturity  cubist does not believe that it has a material exposure to interest rate risk 
interest rate risk cubist invests its cash in a variety of financial instruments  principally securities issued by the us government and its agencies  investment grade corporate bonds and notes and money market instruments 
these investments are denominated in us dollars 
all of its interest bearing securities are subject to interest rate risk  and could decline in value if interest rates fluctuate 
the primary market risk exposure is that of interest rate risk on borrowings under cubist s credit facility  which are subject to interest rates based on the bank s base rate 
a change in the applicable interest rate on this loan would affect the rate at which cubist could borrow funds 
cubist estimates that the hypothetical loss in earnings for one year of borrowings held at december   resulting from a hypothetical increase in interest rates  would not have materially impacted net income or materially affected the fair value of interest rate sensitive instruments 
the fair market value of long term debt at december  amounted to million  and consisted of fixed rate debt with maturities through foreign currency risk cubist faces exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
international revenues and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies 
the functional currency of cubist s uk subsidiary is the us dollar 
cubist s international activities are subject to risks typical of an international business  including  but not limited to differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange rate volatility 
based on cubist s overall currency rate exposure at december   a change in foreign exchange rates would have had an immaterial effect on its financial position  results of operations and cash flows
