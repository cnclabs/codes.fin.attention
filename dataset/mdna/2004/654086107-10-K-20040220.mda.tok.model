item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the purpose of this financial review is to explain changes in operating results and financial condition from to and to discuss business trends and uncertainties that might affect nicor inc nicor 
certain terms used herein are defined in the glossary on page i 
the discussion is organized into five sections summary  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity  critical accounting estimates  and factors that may affect business performance 
summary nicor inc nicor is a holding company with two principal subsidiaries nicor gas and tropical shipping 
nicor gas is one of the nation s largest natural gas distribution companies and typically represents approximately percent of nicor s operating income 
tropical shipping is a containerized shipping business serving the bahamas and the caribbean region that typically represents approximately percent of nicor s operating income 
nicor also owns or has equity interests in several energy related businesses which have begun to provide a small but growing amount of income 
net income and diluted earnings per common share are presented below in millions  except per share data income before cumulative effect of accounting change net income earnings per average share of common stock diluted before cumulative effect of accounting change diluted after cumulative effect of accounting change net income was lower in compared with due primarily to lower operating income from the gas distribution segment  the cumulative effect of a change in accounting methods and an increase in the effective income tax rate 
these factors were partially offset by improved equity investment results due primarily to cash received from a previously written off investment 
net income was higher in compared with due primarily to increased insurance recoveries at the company s gas distribution segment related to its mercury inspection and repair program  partially offset by other operating income reductions in the gas distribution segment 
lower net interest expense  and operating income improvements in the shipping segment  also contributed to the improvement 
nicor s net income and earnings per share were positively impacted for all periods presented by the recognition of partial recoveries from insurers and contractors and or reserve reductions for nicor gas mercury inspection and repair program 
the recognition of partial recoveries from insurers and contractors and or reserve reductions lowered pretax operating expenses by million  million and million in  and  respectively

results of operations details of various financial and operating information by segment can be found in the tables throughout this review 
the following discussion summarizes the major items impacting nicor s results of operations 
operating revenues 
operating revenues by major business segment are presented below in millions gas distribution shipping other energy ventures corporate and eliminations gas distribution revenues increased nearly percent in compared to due primarily to higher natural gas costs  which are passed directly through to customers without markup  subject to icc review 
the revenue effect of higher natural gas costs was approximately million 
revenues also increased in by about million due to colder weather 
while residential deliveries rose on colder weather  industrial deliveries fell due largely to lower power generation load affected by mild summer weather 
the decrease in gas distribution revenues compared to was due primarily to much lower average natural gas costs 
the revenue effect of the lower average natural gas costs  estimated to be approximately million  was partially offset by the impact of colder weather about million in compared to in  shipping segment operating revenues increased due primarily to higher volumes shipped million  higher average rates million and increased charter income million 
higher volumes reflect increased activity from an acquisition that occurred in april in  shipping segment results included higher volume related revenues million partially offset by lower average rates million 
the increases in volume related revenues resulted primarily from acquisitions 
the slow economy in the caribbean region in put pressure on rates 

table of contents nicor inc page item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the increase in revenues for other energy ventures was due primarily to the company s energy related products and services businesses million  largely reflecting new customers and products  such as utility bill management products introduced in negatively impacting were decreased revenues from nicor s former energy system development activities million 
the increase in revenues for other energy ventures was due primarily to higher revenue at the company s energy related products and services businesses  which increased million to million 
partially offsetting this increase were decreased revenues from former energy system development activities million 
corporate and eliminations reflects primarily the elimination of gas distribution revenues against expenses for customers purchasing the utility bill management products 
gas distribution margin 
nicor utilizes a measure it refers to as gas distribution margin to evaluate the operating income impact of gas distribution revenues 
gas distribution revenues include gas costs  which are passed directly through to customers without markup  subject to icc review  and revenue taxes  for which nicor gas earns only a small administrative fee 
these items often cause significant fluctuations in gas distribution revenues  and yet they have virtually no direct impact on gas distribution operating income 
therefore  nicor gas excludes these items in evaluating performance 
a reconciliation of gas distribution revenues and margin follows in millions gas distribution revenues cost of gas revenue tax expense gas distribution margin although and were essentially equal  a number of factors impacted margin 
negatively impacting margin in was a smaller contribution from the chicago hub and other nontraditional gas supply related activities million and lower industrial deliveries  mainly for power generation million 
the company believes commercial and industrial deliveries were unfavorably impacted by general economic conditions and higher natural gas prices 
positively impacting margin were increased customer finance and late payment charges million related to higher natural gas prices in the absence of pbr plan losses as occurred in million and increased deliveries due to colder weather than the prior year about million  partially offset by an unfavorable variance from the company s weather hedge in compared to million  also positively impacted margin 
gas distribution margin increased million in contributing to the improvement were lower pbr plan losses compared to million 
additional information related to the pbr plan is included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements note contingencies performance based rate plan 
other factors affecting margin in were the positive effects of increased natural gas deliveries unrelated to weather million and colder weather about million  and the negative effect of lower revenues from customer finance and late payment charges million 
the reduction of revenues from customer finance and late payment charges was related to lower levels of customer receivables arising from reduced natural gas prices in

table of contents nicor inc page item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued other energy ventures operating expenses 
the million increase in the operating expenses compared to was due primarily to increased expenses at nicor s energy related products and services businesses million associated largely with the addition of new customers and products 
this increase was partially offset by lower operating expenses from the company s former energy system and design activities million 
the million increase in other energy ventures operating expenses for compared to was due primarily to increased expenses at nicor s energy related products and services businesses million associated largely with the addition of new customers and products 
the increase was partially offset by lower operating expenses from nicor s former energy system development activities million and its gas distribution technology business million 
corporate operating expenses and eliminations 
corporate operating expenses of million  million and million in  and  respectively  include primarily legal and business development costs

lower results in reflect a million investment loss from nicor energy  including the impairment writedown  compared with a loss of 
million in equity investment results also include million  million and million for  and  respectively  for nicor s share of triton container investments llc results 
other income expense 
other income expense  net was million in  million in  and million in the fluctuation from year to year was due primarily to reduced short term investment levels and the resultant effect on interest income 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased million in and was down million in compared to due to lower average borrowing levels and interest rates 
income taxes 
the company s effective income tax rate rose to percent in as compared to percent in due principally to the effects of an increase in tax expense in relating to adjustments of deferred tax accounts and a reduction in tax expense in resulting from the completion of an income tax audit 
cumulative effect of accounting change 
the cumulative effect of a january  required accounting change relates to the application of accrual accounting  rather than fair value accounting  to gas in storage and certain energy related contracts  such as storage and transportation contracts  at nicor enerchange  nicor s wholesale natural gas marketing business

these resources include net cash flow from operating activities  access to capital markets  lines of credit and short term investments 
operating cash flows 
the gas distribution business is highly seasonal and operating cash flow may fluctuate significantly during the year and from year to year due to factors such as weather  natural gas prices  the timing of collections from customers  and natural gas purchasing and storage practices 
the company relies on short term financing to meet seasonal increases in working capital needs 
cash requirements generally increase during the third and fourth quarters due to increases in natural gas purchases  gas in storage and accounts receivable 
during the first and second quarters  positive cash flow generally occurs from the sale of gas in storage and the collection of accounts receivable 
this cash is typically used to reduce short term debt to near zero during the second quarter 
net cash flow used for provided from operating activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
operating cash flow for was negative due primarily to changes in working capital items in the gas distribution segment 
two decisions in were the primary factors underlying the working capital changes 
first  the company significantly increased the quantity of owned gas in storage at december  as compared to december  in addition  to reduce associated costs  the company chose to fund a significant portion of those purchases through short term borrowings which are shown outside the operating segment  in the financing segment  of the consolidated statements of cash flows instead of accounts payable 
as noted in the financing activities section of management s discussion and analysis  the company had increased its short term debt borrowing capacity in anticipation of these two and other factors including higher gas costs  accommodating the funding of these decisions without impacting the level of long term borrowing 
the company believes that operating cash flow will be positive in  as inventory and accounts payable balances at year end should be comparable to year end in the fourth quarter of  nicor received an income tax refund of approximately million attributable to a tax loss carryback associated with a change in tax accounting methods  subject to future internal revenue service review and approval 
decisions by taxing authorities may significantly impact the company s cash flow 
operating cash flow was significantly lower in compared to due primarily to changes in accounts receivable  accrued deferred gas costs and accounts payable balances associated with natural gas price volatility

capital expenditures by business segment are presented below in millions estimated gas distribution shipping other energy ventures capital expenditures in the gas distribution segment for versus remained relatively level 
increased costs in for public main improvements of million and higher capitalized pension costs of million were offset by a million decrease in supply operations expenditures compared with supply operations expenditures in included the acquisition of a compressor for a storage facility 
gas distribution capital expenditures were higher in than in due primarily to the acquisition of the compressor and million of higher capitalized employee benefit costs 
shipping segment capital expenditures were higher than normal in due primarily to the construction of two vessels 
expenditures were lower in and were further reduced in because vessel construction was completed in early shipping segment capital expenditures are expected to rise in due to facilities renovations  the purchase of freight handling equipment and systems upgrades that were postponed from capital expenditures are expected to be higher at our other energy ventures in as computer systems are upgraded and facilities expanded at our retail energy related products and services businesses

nicor inc and nicor gas maintain short term line of credit agreements with major domestic and foreign banks 
these agreements  which serve as backup for the issuance of commercial paper  allow for borrowings of up to billion through march and million thereafter through september commitment fees paid in advance totaled million and are being amortized over the respective terms of the agreements as interest expense 
the company had million and million of commercial paper borrowings outstanding at december  and  respectively 
under the company s short term line of credit agreements  if nicor s or nicor gas ratio of consolidated indebtedness to capitalization including short term debt exceeds at the end of the first  second or third fiscal quarter  or at december   or nicor s or nicor gas twelve months ended interest coverage ratio is less than to at the end of any fiscal quarter during the term of the credit agreements  banks representing two thirds of the commitments may declare any amounts due immediately payable and or terminate the commitments to make advances to the company

as of december   nicor had contractual obligations with payments due as follows in millions payments due by period less more than than total year years years years purchase obligations long term debt operating leases other long term obligations purchase obligations consist primarily of natural gas transportation and storage contracts  and natural gas purchase agreements in the gas distribution and wholesale natural gas marketing segments 
purchase obligations also include obligations to purchase natural gas at future market prices  calculated using december  nymex futures prices 
operating leases are primarily for vessels  containers and equipment in the shipping segment  and for office space and equipment in the gas distribution segment 
rental expense under operating leases was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
off balance sheet arrangements 
nicor has certain guarantees  as further described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements note guarantees and indemnities 
the company believes that it is unlikely that these guarantees will have a material effect on its financial condition 
other 
restrictions imposed by regulatory agencies and loan agreements limiting the amount of subsidiary net assets that can be transferred to nicor are not expected to have a material impact on the company s ability to meet its cash obligations 
critical accounting estimates nicor prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which regularly require nicor s management to exercise judgment in the selection and application of accounting methods 
the application of accounting methods includes making estimates using subjective assumptions and judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 
the use of estimates and the selection of accounting policies affect nicor s reported results and financial condition 
the company has adopted several significant accounting policies and is required to make significant accounting estimates that are important to understanding its financial statements and are described throughout the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents nicor inc page item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued although there are numerous areas in which nicor s management makes significant accounting estimates  it believes its critical estimates are those that require management s most difficult and subjective or complex judgments 
nicor s management has a practice of reviewing its critical accounting estimates and policy decisions with the audit committee of its board of directors 
its critical estimates typically involve loss contingencies  derivative instruments  income taxes  credit risk and unbilled revenues because they are estimates which could materially impact nicor s financial statements 
loss contingencies 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards fas no 
 nicor and its subsidiaries record contingent losses as liabilities when a loss is both probable and the amount or range of loss  including related legal defense costs  is reasonably estimable 
when only a range of potential loss is estimable  the company records a liability for the minimum anticipated loss 
nicor and its subsidiaries and affiliates are involved in various legal and regulatory proceedings and are exposed to various loss contingencies 
these loss contingencies are in some cases resolved in stages over time  estimates may change significantly from period to period  and the company s ultimate obligations may differ materially from its estimates 
of particular note is the pbr plan contingency at nicor gas described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements note contingencies 
derivative instruments 
the rules for determining whether a contract meets the definition of a derivative instrument or qualifies for hedge accounting treatment are numerous and complex 
the treatment of a single contract may vary from period to period depending upon accounting elections  changes in management s assessment of the likelihood of future hedged transactions or new interpretations of accounting rules 
as a result  management judgment is required in the determination of the appropriate accounting treatment 
in addition  the estimated fair value of derivative instruments may change significantly from period to period depending upon market projections  and changes in hedge effectiveness may impact the accounting treatment 
these determinations and changes in estimates may have a material impact on reported results 
income taxes 
a deferred income tax liability is not required on undistributed foreign earnings that are indefinitely reinvested offshore 
nicor has recorded a million deferred income tax liability associated with foreign earnings it may repatriate  and it has not recorded deferred income taxes of million on approximately million of cumulative undistributed foreign earnings it believes to be indefinitely reinvested offshore 
changes in management plans or circumstances could result in a different deferred income tax liability 
credit risk 
nicor s subsidiaries and affiliates are required to estimate credit risk in establishing allowances for doubtful accounts and in estimating the fair values of certain derivative instruments with counterparty credit risk being an especially difficult and critical judgment 
actual credit losses could vary materially from nicor s estimates 
nicor s allowance for doubtful accounts at december   and was million  million and million  respectively  as presented on schedule ii on page unbilled revenues 
nicor gas estimates revenues for gas deliveries not yet billed to customers from the last billing date to month end unbilled revenues 
unbilled revenue estimates are dependent upon a number of factors which require management judgment  including projections of gas costs  weather and customer usage 
these estimates are adjusted when actual billings occur  and changes in estimates can be material 
estimated unbilled revenues for nicor gas at december   and were million  million and million  respectively 

table of contents nicor inc page item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued factors that may affect business performance the following factors can impact year to year comparisons and may affect the future performance of nicor s businesses 
gas distribution 
nicor gas  a regulated natural gas distribution utility  serves over two million customers in a service territory that encompasses most of the northern third of illinois  excluding the city of chicago 
the region s economy is diverse and its customer base has grown steadily over the years  providing nicor gas with a well balanced mix of residential  commercial and industrial customers 
in  residential  commercial and industrial customers accounted for approximately percent  percent and percent of natural gas deliveries  respectively 
weather 
natural gas deliveries are temperature sensitive and seasonal since about one half of all deliveries are used for space heating 
typically  about percent of deliveries and revenues occur from october through march 
fluctuations in weather have the potential to significantly impact year to year comparisons of operating income and cash flow 
in  and the first quarter of  nicor gas purchased earnings protection against the impact of significantly warmer than normal or colder than normal weather 
no agreement is in effect for the heating season 
there is a partial offset to nicor gas weather risk that arises from the utility bill management products marketed by nicor solutions  a nicor energy related products and services business 
before consideration of this offset  it is estimated that in a degree day variation from normal weather about  degree days per year may affect nicor s earnings per share by about cents 
it is estimated that the offset arising from utility bill management products is at least one third that amount 
the actual amount of this offset will vary depending on the number of customers for these products and the market price for natural gas 
the company will continue to evaluate its coverage options to determine whether any weather protection should be purchased 
demand and natural gas prices 
in addition to the impact of weather  significant changes in economic conditions or natural gas prices can impact customer gas usage 
however  nicor gas large residential customer base provides relative stability during weak economic periods  and the industrial and commercial customer base is well diversified  lessening the impact of industry specific economic swings 
nicor gas growth in natural gas deliveries has traditionally come from customer additions and increased usage by commercial and industrial customers 
in commercial and industrial deliveries were unfavorably impacted by general economic conditions 
the company is uncertain as to the long term impact of this factor 
changes in the price of natural gas have no direct impact on gas distribution margin since gas costs are passed directly through to customers without markup  subject to icc review 
however  high natural gas prices can have an adverse effect on accounts receivable collections  customer demand  company use gas expenses  financing costs and customer service expenses 

table of contents nicor inc page item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued competition 
nicor gas competes with other energy suppliers based on such factors as price  service and reliability 
the company believes that it is well positioned to deal with the possibility of fuel switching by customers because it has rates and services designed to compete against alternative fuels 
in addition  the company has a rate that allows negotiation with potential bypass customers  and no customer has bypassed the nicor gas system since the rate became effective in nicor gas also offers commercial and industrial customers alternatives in rates and service  increasing its ability to compete in these markets 
storage and supply 
nicor gas has a direct connection to eight interstate pipelines and extensive underground storage capacity that provides the company and its transportation customers with flexibility and alternatives for natural gas supply procurement and storage services 
in addition  in an effort to ensure supply reliability  the company purchases gas from several different producing regions under varied contract terms 
customer choice of commodity supplier 
since march  all nicor gas customers have had a choice of natural gas suppliers 
previously  supplier choice was available to all industrial and commercial customers and about percent of residential customers 
the choice of another natural gas commodity supplier has no direct impact on gas distribution margin because natural gas costs are passed directly through to customers without markup  subject to icc review 
nicor gas continues to deliver the natural gas  maintain its distribution system and respond to emergencies 
customer credit risk 
nicor gas has a diversified customer base  which limits its exposure to concentrations of credit risk in any one industry or income class 
the company believes that it maintains prudent credit policies  subject to icc regulations 
customers also have options to help them manage their bills  such as energy assistance programs for low income customers and a budget payment plan that spreads gas bills more evenly throughout the year 
however  high natural gas prices can increase the risk of customer nonpayment 
nicor gas experienced increasing bad debt expense in the past three years due in part to high natural gas prices and increasingly adverse credit experience consistent with general market conditions 
it is expected that high natural gas prices will continue in see also the credit risk section on page pension investment returns 
nicor gas maintains a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all employees hired prior to for actuarial valuation purposes  nicor gas utilizes an october measurement date to determine the company s pension expense or credit for the subsequent calendar year 
during the months ended september   the pension plans experienced poor investment returns consistent with general market conditions  negatively impacting the company s operating income 
the company s pension credit expense included in operating income was 
million  million and million in  and  respectively 
pension credits represented percent and percent of nicor s net income in and  respectively 
the october  actuarial valuation reflected higher asset values which  absent any plan or accounting rule changes  will lead to a pension credit for  increasing operating income by about million 
actuarial assumptions affecting include an expected rate of return on plan assets of and a discount rate of  reduced from and  respectively  for anticipated impacts of the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of have not yet been estimated by nicor gas 
the pension plans are adequately funded  and recent market performance is not expected to impact participant benefits or future company contributions 
however  substantial declines in market performance or changes to actuarial assumptions could require future company contributions 

table of contents nicor inc page item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued nontraditional activities 
nicor gas continues to pursue nontraditional activities  including the chicago hub  which provides natural gas transportation and storage services 
the chicago area is a major market hub for natural gas  and demand exists for storage and transmission related services by marketers  other gas distribution companies and electric power generation facilities 
during  and  the chicago hub contributed to operating income million  million and million  respectively 
the decline reflects primarily unfavorable general market conditions  including less liquidity in the market 
regulation 
nicor gas is regulated by the icc  which establishes the rules and regulations governing utility rates and services in illinois 
certain rates are updated monthly and designed to recover specific past costs  such as gas supply and environmental costs  subject to an annual prudence review 
base rates  on the other hand  are designed to allow the company an opportunity to recover its costs and to earn a fair return for its investors 
nicor gas has the option to seek icc approval for a base rate increase 
once started  a rate relief proceeding generally takes about one year 
the company s last rate increase was in significant changes in the regulations applicable to nicor gas or its affiliates  or the regulatory environment in general  could affect the performance of nicor gas 
information regarding certain icc proceedings is presented within the notes to the consolidated financial statements note contingencies performance based rate plan 
labor negotiations 
the current labor contract between nicor gas and the international brotherhood of electrical workers ibew local expires on february  the current agreement covers approximately  physical and clerical employees of nicor gas 
as of the filing date of this report  negotiations between ibew representatives and the company continue 
nicor gas believes that there are adequate contingency plans in the event of a work stoppage  which the company currently does not expect 
outlook 
due to the absence of gains from mercury related recoveries that occurred in and higher operating costs  gas distribution results for are expected to be lower than also  the icc s performance based rate plan purchased gas adjustment review could significantly affect results  but is not estimable 
shipping 
tropical shipping is one of the largest containerized cargo carriers in the bahamas and caribbean region 
tropical shipping has a reputation for providing quality  on time delivery service a reputation that has helped the company establish a leading position in most of the markets it serves 
the company is a major carrier of exports from the east coast of the united states and canada to the caribbean region

nicor continues to explore new energy ventures 

table of contents nicor inc page item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued nicor has substantially liquidated its investment in nicor energy  a percent owned retail energy marketing joint venture with dynegy marketing and trade 
nicor s investment in nicor energy was written off in due to the belief at that time that nicor ultimately would not recover its investment balance 
during  nicor energy disposed of its customer contracts  ceased operations  and is in the process of liquidating its remaining assets and resolving remaining contingent liabilities 
nicor recorded gains of million in upon the receipt of cash from nicor energy and future gains or losses are expected to be minimal 
market risk 
nicor is exposed to market risk in the normal course of its business operations  including the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in natural gas commodity prices  credit conditions and interest rates 
it is nicor s practice to manage these risks utilizing derivative instruments and other methods  as deemed appropriate 
commodity price risk 
with regard to commodity price risk  the company has established policies and procedures governing the management of such risks and the use of derivative instruments to hedge its exposure to such risks 
a risk management committee oversees compliance with such policies and procedures 
the company utilizes various techniques to limit  measure and monitor market risk  including limits based on volume  dollar amounts and duration  and in some cases value at risk var 
var is the potential loss for an instrument or portfolio from adverse changes in market factors  for a specified time period and at a specified confidence level 
the company s risk management committee has established exposure limits at such a level that material adverse economic results are not expected 
the company s commodity price risk policies and procedures continue to evolve with its businesses and are subject to ongoing review and modification 
in accordance with securities and exchange commission sec disclosure requirements  nicor performs sensitivity analyses to assess the potential loss in earnings based upon a hypothetical percent adverse change in market prices 
management does not believe that sensitivity analyses alone provide an accurate or reliable method for monitoring and controlling risks and therefore also relies on the experience and judgment of its management to revise strategies and adjust positions as deemed necessary 
losses in excess of the amounts determined in sensitivity analyses could occur if market prices exceed the percent shift used for the analyses 
based on nicor s unhedged positions at december   a percent decrease in natural gas prices would have increased nicor s earnings at december  by about  which is not materially different than in the prior year 
nicor s regulated utility  nicor gas  is not directly exposed to market risk caused by changes in commodity prices because of illinois rate regulation allowing for the recovery of prudently incurred natural gas supply costs from customers 
however  substantial increases in natural gas prices may indirectly impact nicor gas earnings by increasing the cost of gas used by the company  bad debt expense and other operating expenses 
higher natural gas prices may also lead to lower customer gas consumption and margin 
the company is mitigating these risks through the use of fixed price purchase agreements  futures contracts and swap agreements 
nicor s other energy businesses are subject to natural gas commodity price risk  arising primarily from fixed price purchase and sale agreements and natural gas inventories 
derivative instruments such as futures  options  forwards and swaps may be used to hedge this risk 
in addition  management believes it has taken appropriate steps to mitigate the risks of loss associated with its utility bill management products 

table of contents nicor inc page item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued at december   nicor enerchange  nicor s wholesale natural gas marketing business  had derivative contracts outstanding with the following fair values in millions maturity total less than to to source of fair value fair value year years years prices actively quoted prices based on pricing models total credit risk 
the company is also exposed to credit risk in the event a counterparty  customer or supplier defaults on a contract to pay for or deliver product at agreed upon terms and conditions 
to manage this risk  the company has established procedures to determine and monitor the creditworthiness of counterparties  to require guarantees or collateral back up  and to limit its exposure to any one counterparty 
nicor also  in some instances  enters into netting arrangements to mitigate counterparty credit risk 
interest rate risk 
nicor is exposed to changes in interest rates 
the company manages its interest rate risk by issuing long term fixed rate debt with varying maturities  refinancing certain debt and periodically hedging the interest rate on anticipated borrowings

the effective income tax rate is currently expected to be about percent 
contingencies 
the following contingencies of nicor are in various stages of investigation or disposition 
although in some cases the company is unable to estimate the amount of loss reasonably possible in addition to any amounts already recognized  it is possible that the resolution of these contingencies  either individually or in aggregate  will require the company to take charges against  or will result in reductions in  future earnings 
it is the opinion of management that the resolution of these contingencies  either individually or in aggregate  could be material to earnings in a particular period but is not expected to have a material adverse impact on nicor s liquidity or financial condition 
performance based rate plan 
nicor gas pbr plan for natural gas costs went into effect in and was terminated by the company effective january  under the pbr plan  nicor gas total gas supply costs were compared to a market sensitive benchmark 
savings and losses relative to the benchmark were determined annually and shared equally with sales customers 
the pbr is currently under illinois commerce commission icc review 
there are allegations that the company acted improperly in connection with the pbr plan  and the icc and others are reviewing these allegations 
on june  the citizens utility board cub filed a motion to reopen the record in the icc s proceedings to review the pbr plan the icc proceedings 
as a result of the motion to reopen  nicor gas  the cook county state s attorney office ccsao  the staff of the icc and cub entered into a stipulation providing for additional discovery 
the illinois attorney general s office has also intervened in this matter 
in addition  the illinois attorney general s office issued civil investigation demands cids to cub and the icc staff 
the cids ordered that cub and the icc staff produce all documents relating to any claims that nicor gas may have presented  or caused 
table of contents nicor inc page item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued to be presented  false information related to its pbr plan 
parties who were plaintiffs in a dismissed class action proceeding against the company could potentially intervene in these proceedings 
the company has committed to cooperate fully in the reviews of the pbr plan 
in response to these allegations  on july   the nicor board of directors appointed a special committee of independent  non management directors to conduct an inquiry into issues surrounding natural gas purchases  sales  transportation  storage and such other matters as may come to the attention of the special committee in the course of its investigation 
the special committee presented the report of its counsel report to nicor s board of directors on october  the findings of the report include certain transactions increased customer costs in the aggregate amount of approximately million 
no improper nicor affiliated party transactions or improper hedging activities were identified 
inadvertent accounting errors occurred  sometimes to the benefit of customers and sometimes to the benefit of nicor gas 
no criminal activity or fraud was identified 
in response  the nicor board of directors directed the company s management to  among other things  make appropriate adjustments to account for  and fully address  the adverse consequences to ratepayers of the items noted in the report  and conduct a detailed study of the adequacy of internal accounting and regulatory controls 
the adjustments were made in financial statements resulting in a million liability at december  included in such million adjustments is a million loss contingency 
in addition  nicor gas estimates that there is million due to the company from the pbr plan year  which has not been recognized in the financial statements due to uncertainties surrounding the pbr plan 
the net of these items results in a million reimbursement the company is seeking as of december   pending resolution of the proceedings discussed below 
the company has taken steps throughout to correct the weaknesses and deficiencies identified in the detailed study of the adequacy of internal controls 
pursuant to the agreement of all parties  including the company  the icc re opened the and purchased gas adjustment filings for review of certain transactions related to the pbr plan and consolidated the reviews of the purchased gas adjustment filings with the pbr plan review 
on february   the ccsao and cub filed a motion for million in sanctions against the company in the icc proceedings 
in that motion  ccsao and cub alleged that nicor gas responses to certain cub data requests were false 
also on february   cub stated in a press release that  in addition to million in sanctions  it would seek additional refunds to consumers 
on march   the icc staff filed a response brief in support of cub s motion for sanctions 
on may   the administrative law judges issued a ruling denying cub and ccsao s motion for sanctions 
cub has filed an appeal of the motion for sanctions with the icc  and the icc has indicated that it will not rule on the appeal until the final disposition of the icc proceedings 
it is not possible to determine how the icc will resolve the claims of ccsao  cub or other parties to the icc proceedings 

table of contents nicor inc page item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued in november  the icc staff  cub  ccsao and the illinois attorney general s office iago filed their respective direct testimony in the icc proceedings 
the icc staff is seeking refunds to customers of approximately million and cub and ccsao are jointly seeking refunds to customers of approximately million 
the iago direct testimony alleges adjustments in a range from million to million 
the iago testimony as filed is presently unclear as to the amount which iago seeks to have refunded to customers 
nicor gas filed rebuttal testimony in january  which is consistent with the findings of the special committee report and  as noted above  seeks a reimbursement to nicor gas of approximately million 
nicor is unable to predict the outcome of any of the foregoing reviews or the company s potential exposure thereunder 
because the pbr plan and historical gas costs are still under icc review  the final outcome could be materially different than the amounts reflected in the company s financial statements as of december  nicor energy

accounting irregularities at nicor energy were identified in information about these developments is presented within the notes to the consolidated financial statements note contingencies nicor energy

the three former employees of nicor energy have pled guilty to the charges 
separately  on december   the united states securities and exchange commission sec filed its own civil enforcement action against the same three former employees and one additional former employee of nicor energy 
while nicor is unable to predict the final outcome of these matters  the resolution of such matters is not expected to have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations
