liquidity and capital resources the company s operations and growth have been financed with funds generated from operations and bank borrowings 
the company maintains a combined long term line of credit with two commercial lenders the credit facility 
the credit facility provides a  long term line of credit that matures on august  and bears interest at the prevailing libor rate which was approximately at december  plus an applicable margin based on a defined leverage ratio for the company 
based on the company s existing leverage ratio  the margin is currently  the most favorable rate provided under the terms of the agreement 
amounts available under the credit facility are limited to of the company s earnings before income taxes  interest  depreciation and amortization for the trailing twelve months 
at december   the company had  available for additional borrowings 
under the terms of the credit facility  the company is required to maintain certain financial ratios and comply with certain technical covenants

the profitability and liquidity of the company is affected by the amount of pawn loans outstanding  which is controlled in part by the company s lending decisions 
the company is able to influence the frequency of pawn redemption by increasing or decreasing the amount pawned in relation to the resale value of the pledged property 
tighter credit decisions generally result in smaller pawns in relation to the estimated resale value of the pledged property and can thereby decrease the company s aggregate pawn balance and  consequently  decrease pawn service charges 
additionally  small advances in relation to the pledged property s estimated resale value tend to increase pawn redemptions and improve the company s liquidity 
conversely  providing larger pawns in relation to the estimated resale value of the pledged property can result in an increase in the company s pawn service charge income 
also  larger average pawn balances can result in an increase in pawn forfeitures  which increases the quantity of goods on hand and  unless the company increases inventory turnover  reduces the company s liquidity 
the company s renewal policy allows customers to renew pawns by repaying all accrued interest on such pawns  effectively creating a new pawn transaction 
the amount of short term advances outstanding and related potential bad debt expense also affect the profitability and liquidity of the company 
an allowance for losses is provided on active short term advances and service charges receivable  based upon expected default rates  net of estimated future recoveries of previously defaulted short term advances and service charges receivable 
the company considers short term advances to be in default if they are not repaid on the due date  and writes off the principal amount and service charges receivable as of the default date  leaving only active receivables in the reported balances 
net defaults and changes in the short term advance allowance are charged to bad debt expense  which is included in operating expenses 
in addition to these factors  merchandise sales and the pace of store expansions affect the company s liquidity 
management believes that the credit facility and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to accommodate the company s current operations for fiscal the company has no significant capital commitments 
the company currently has no written commitments for additional borrowings or future acquisitions  however  the company intends to continue to grow and may seek additional capital to facilitate expansion 
the company will evaluate acquisitions  if any  based upon opportunities  acceptable financing  purchase price  strategic fit and qualified management personnel 
the company currently intends to continue to engage in a plan of expansion primarily through new store openings 
during fiscal  the company currently plans to open new stores  comprised of both check cashing short term advance locations  primarily located in texas  and pawnshops  primarily in mexico 
the majority of this expansion will be funded through operating cash flows 
management believes that the company has the ability to obtain an increase to the credit facility if necessary to complete funding of the expansion plans 
while the company continually looks for  and is presented with potential acquisition candidates  the company has no definitive plans or commitments for further acquisitions 
if the company encounters an attractive opportunity to acquire new stores in the near future  the company will seek additional financing  the terms of which will be negotiated on a case by case basis 
between january  and march   the company opened new check cashing short term advance location and pawnshops  while pawnshops located in the us were closed

inflation the company does not believe that inflation has had a material effect on the amount of pawns and short term advances made or unredeemed goods sold by the company or its results of operation 
seasonality the company s retail business is seasonal in nature with its highest volume of merchandise sales occurring during the first and fourth calendar quarters of each year

recent accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
r fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities formerly special purpose entities 
in general  a variable interest entity is a corporation  partnership  trust or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either a does not have equity investors with voting rights or b has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities 
the objective of fin is not to restrict the use of variable interest entities  but to improve financial reporting by companies involved with variable interest entities 
fin requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
the consolidation requirements are effective for the first period that ends after march   however  the company has elected to adopt the requirements effective december  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks relating to the company s operations result primarily from changes in interest rates  foreign exchange rates  and gold prices 
the company does not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions  nor does it hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
interest rate risk the company is exposed to market risk in the form of interest rate risk in regards to its long term line of credit 
as of march  the line of credit had no balance outstanding  therefore the company s interest rate risk for is immaterial 
the company s cash and cash equivalents are invested in money market accounts 
accordingly  the company is subject to changes in market interest rates 
however  the company does not believe a change in these rates would have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results  financial condition  and cash flows 
foreign currency risk a majority of the company s pawn loans in mexico are currently contracted and settled in us dollars and therefore the company bears limited exchange risk from its operations in mexico 
the company maintained certain mexican peso denominated pawn loan balances at december   which converted to a us dollar equivalent of  the company also maintained certain peso denominated bank balances at december   which converted to a us dollar equivalent of  a increase in the peso to us dollar exchange rate would increase the company s foreign currency translation exposure by approximately  gold price risk a significant and sustained decline in the price of gold would negatively impact the value of jewelry inventories held by the company and the value of jewelry pledged as collateral by pawn customers 
as a result  the company s profit margins on existing jewelry inventories would be negatively impacted  as would be the potential profit margins on jewelry currently pledged as collateral by pawn customers in the event it is forfeited by the pawn customer 
in addition  a decline in gold prices could result in a lower balance of pawn loans outstanding for the company  as customers would receive lower loan amounts for individual pieces of jewelry 
the company believes that many customers would be willing to add additional items of value to their pledge in order to obtain the desired loan amount  thus mitigating a portion of this risk
