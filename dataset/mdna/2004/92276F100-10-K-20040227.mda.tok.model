item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis provides information which management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the consolidated results of operations and financial condition of ventas  inc ventas or the company 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in this annual report on form k 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap  which require the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the related disclosures 
the company believes that the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its condensed consolidated financial statements 
impairment of long lived assets the company periodically evaluates its long lived assets  primarily consisting of its investments in real estate  for impairment indicators 
if indicators of impairment are present  the company evaluates the carrying value of the related real estate investments in relation to the future undiscounted cash flows of the underlying operations 
the company adjusts the net book value of leased properties and other long lived assets to fair value  if the sum of the expected future cash flow or sales proceeds is less than book value 
future events could occur which would cause the company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and an impairment loss is warranted 
during the year ended december   the company recorded a million impairment on one of its non operating skilled nursing facilities

legal contingencies the company is currently involved in certain legal proceedings 
as described further in note litigation to the consolidated financial statements  the company is currently involved in certain legal proceedings and other matters that arose from the company s operations prior to the time of the company s spin off of kindred healthcare  inc together with its subsidiaries  kindred on may  the spin off or relate to assets or liabilities transferred to kindred in connection with the spin off 
under the various agreements the spin agreements entered into by the company and kindred at the time of the spin off  as such agreements may have been amended and restated in connection with kindred s emergence from bankruptcy on april   kindred agreed to assume the defense  on behalf of the company  of any claims

index to financial statements that a were pending at the time of the spin off and which arose out of the ownership or operation of the healthcare operations or any of the assets or liabilities transferred to kindred in connection with the spin off  or b were asserted after the spin off and which arose out of the ownership and operation of the healthcare operations or any of the assets or liabilities transferred to kindred in connection with the spin off  and to indemnify the company for any fees  costs  expenses and liabilities arising out of such operations 
kindred is presently defending the company in these matters  however  there can be no assurance that kindred will continue to defend the company in such matters or that kindred will have sufficient assets  income and access to financing to enable it to satisfy such obligations 
a change in kindred s ability or willingness to perform under these commitments could have a material adverse effect defined below on the company 
the company is also involved in other litigation as further described in note litigation to the consolidated financial statements 
it is the opinion of management that  except as set forth in note litigation to the consolidated financial statements  the disposition of such matters will not  individually or in the aggregate  have a material adverse effect on the business  financial condition  results of operations and liquidity of the company  and on the company s ability to make distributions to its stockholders as required to continue to qualify as a real estate investment trust reit a material adverse effect 
if management s assessment of the company s liability with respect to these actions in incorrect  such matters could have a material adverse effect on the company 
fair value of derivative instruments the valuation of derivative instruments requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the fair value of the instruments 
fair value for the company s derivatives are verified with a third party consultant which utilizes pricing models that consider forward yield curves and discount rates 
such amounts and the recognition of such amounts in the consolidated financial statements of the company are subject to significant estimates which may change in the future 
income taxes for the year ended december   a provision for income tax was not recorded due to the company s ability and intention to distribute to its stockholders at least of its estimated taxable income and to continue to qualify as a reit 
the company s estimation of its taxable income and the related quarterly dividends is based on a number of assumptions  including  but not limited to  the following kindred performs its obligations under the five master lease agreements pursuant to which the company leases of its hospitals and of its skilled nursing facilities to kindred the kindred master leases  and the spin agreements  the company s other tenants perform their obligations under their leases with the company  no capital transactions  acquisitions or divestitures occur  the company s tax and accounting positions do not change  and the number of issued and outstanding shares of the company s common stock remain relatively unchanged 
these assumptions which impact the estimate of the company s taxable income are subject to change and many are outside the control of the company 
if actual results vary from these assumptions  the company s expectations regarding future dividends may change 
although the company intends to continue to qualify as a reit  it is possible that economic  market  legal  tax or other considerations may cause the company to fail  or elect not  to continue to qualify as a reit 
if the company were to fail  or elect not  to continue to qualify as a reit in any year  the company would be subject to federal income tax and to the applicable state and local income taxes for the affected years 
such tax obligations would have a material adverse effect on the company 
unless eligible for limited relief  if the company failed  or revoked its election  to qualify as a reit  the company would not be eligible to elect again to be treated as a reit before the fifth year after the year of such termination or revocation

ffo for the five years ended december  is summarized in the following table in thousands for the years ended december  net income loss adjustments depreciation on real estate assets realized gain on sale of real estate assets other items discontinued operations real estate depreciation discontinued gain on sale of real estate funds from operations historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  many industry investors have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves 
to overcome this problem  the company considers ffo an appropriate measure of performance of an equity reit and the company uses the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit definition of ffo 
nareit defines ffo as net 
table of contents 
index to financial statements income computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of real estate property  plus depreciation for real estate assets  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
ffo presented herein is not necessarily comparable to ffo presented by other real estate companies due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definition 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap as an indicator of the company s financial performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of the company s liquidity  nor is ffo necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of the company s needs 
the company believes that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of its consolidated historical operating results  ffo should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented in the consolidated financial statements and data included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
asset liability management asset liability management is a key element of the company s overall risk management program 
the objective of asset liability management is to support the achievement of business strategies while maintaining appropriate risk levels 
the asset liability management process focuses on a variety of risks  including market risk primarily interest rate risk and credit risk 
effective management of these risks is an important determinant of the absolute levels and variability of ffo and net worth 
the following discussion addresses the company s integrated management of assets and liabilities  including the use of derivative financial instruments 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
market risk the following discussion of the company s exposure to various market risks contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
these projected results have been prepared utilizing certain assumptions considered reasonable in light of information currently available to the company 
nevertheless  because of the inherent unpredictability of interest rates as well as other factors  actual results could differ materially from those projected in such forward looking information 
the company receives revenue primarily by leasing its assets under leases that are long term triple net leases in which the rental rate is generally fixed with annual escalators  subject to certain limitations 
the company also earns revenue from the thi mezzanine loan 
the company s obligations under the credit agreement are and its obligations under the credit agreement were floating rate obligations whose interest rate and related monthly interest payments vary with the movement in libor 
see note borrowing arrangements to the consolidated financial statements 
the general fixed nature of the company s assets and the variable nature of the company s obligations create interest rate risk 
if interest rates were to rise significantly  the company s lease and other revenue might not be sufficient to meet its debt obligations 
in order to mitigate this risk  in connection with the spin off  the company entered into a swap the swap to effectively convert most of its floating rate debt obligations to fixed rate debt obligations 
interest rate swaps generally involve the exchange of fixed and floating rate interest payments on an underlying notional amount 
the swap expired on june  see note borrowing arrangements senior notes offering to the consolidated financial statements 
on september   the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement the swap in the notional amount of million to hedge floating rate debt for the period between july  and june  the swap is treated as a cash flow hedge for accounting purposes 
the swap is with a highly rated counterparty in which the company pays a fixed rate of and receives libor from the counterparty 
on december   the notional amount of the swap for the period december  through june  was reduced from million to million 
see note borrowing arrangements to the consolidated financial statements 
there are no collateral requirements under

index to financial statements the swap 
the notional amount of the swap is scheduled to decline from million as follows notional amount date june  june  june  in accordance with the terms of the cmbs loan agreement as defined below  on december   ventas finance i  llc ventas finance purchased an interest rate cap from a highly rated counterparty the buy cap 
see liquidity and capital resources credit facility and note borrowing arrangements to the consolidated financial statements 
because the company already hedged its consolidated interest rate risk through the swap and the swap  on december  the company sold an interest rate cap the sell cap for the same notional value million and on the same terms year amortizing libor cap as the buy cap 
if libor should exceed the cap  the sell cap would require the company to pay the counterparty and the buy cap would require the counterparty to pay ventas finance for the interest accruing in excess of the libor cap 
the buy cap and the sell cap are shown separately as an asset and a liability on the company s balance sheet  respectively 
the company believes that the economic substance of the buy cap offsets the net cash flow exposure of the sell cap 
when interest rates rise  the interest rate swaps increase in fair value to the company and when interest rates fall  the interest rate swaps decline in fair value to the company 
similarly  when interest rates increase  the buy cap increases in fair value and the sell cap decreases in fair value 
as of december   interest rates had fallen and the swap was in an unrealized loss position to the company 
generally  interest rate swap agreements with longer terms evidence greater dollar values of variation when interest rates change 
to highlight the sensitivity of the interest rate swaps and caps to changes in interest rates  the following summary shows the effects of a hypothetical instantaneous change of basis points bps in interest rates as of december  swap sell cap buy cap notional amount fair value to the company fair value to the company reflecting change in interest rates bps bps the company paid million under the swap and swap during the year ended december  assuming that interest rates do not change  the company estimates that it will pay approximately million on the swap during the year ended december  the carrying value of the company s variable rate debt approximates fair value 
there is no cash flow impact from the fluctuation of interest rates since the company currently hedges of its variable rate debt 
the fair value of the fixed rate debt is million based on open market trading activity provided by a third party 
credit risk as a result of the spin off  the company has a significant concentration of credit risk with kindred under the kindred master leases 
for the years ended december  and lease rental revenues from kindred totaled million or and or  respectively  of the company s total real estate revenue for the period 
for the year ended december   lease rental revenues from kindred comprised of the company s total lease rental revenues 
accordingly  kindred s financial condition and ability to 
table of contents 
index to financial statements meet its rent obligations will largely determine the company s rental revenues and its ability to make distributions to its stockholders 
in addition  any failure by kindred to effectively conduct its operations could have a material adverse effect on its business reputation or on its ability to enlist and maintain patients in its facilities 
kindred  as well as certain other tenants of the company  have experienced financial difficulty and or filed for bankruptcy 
kindred emerged from bankruptcy on april  despite kindred s emergence from bankruptcy  there can be no assurance that kindred will have sufficient assets  income and access to financing to enable it to satisfy its obligations under the kindred master leases 
since  as of december   the company derived in excess of of its rental revenues from kindred and since the kindred master leases are triple net leases under which kindred is responsible for all insurance  taxes and maintenance and repair expenses required in connection with the leased properties  the inability or unwillingness of kindred to satisfy its obligations under the kindred master leases would have a material adverse effect on the condition of the kindred leased properties  as well as a material adverse effect on the company
