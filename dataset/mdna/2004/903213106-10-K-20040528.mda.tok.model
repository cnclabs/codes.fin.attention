these statements may differ materially from actual future events or results 
readers are referred to the risk factors section at the end of item financial condition cash and cash equivalents at march  were  and working capital the excess of current assets over current liabilities was  compared with  and  respectively  at march  the increase in cash and cash equivalents is primarily attributable to proceeds from a secondary offering completed in october  which resulted in cash proceeds  net of offering costs  of  accounts receivable declined  to  at march  from  at march  the decrease is primarily attributable to the reclassification of the accounts receivable of the discontinued electronic products segment to assets of discontinued operation at march  costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts increased  to  at march  versus  at march  the increase is due to less favorable billing terms on contracts in process at march  estimated earnings on contracts in process declined to  or percent of contracts in process of  at march  compared to estimated earnings on contracts in process of  or percent of contracts in process of  at march  the decrease in estimated margins on contracts in process is attributable to anticipated cost overruns on certain engineering projects during the fiscal year ended march  inventory obligations of certain customers decreased  to nil at march  the decrease is primarily attributable to the reclassification of the inventory obligations of certain customers of the discontinued electronic products segment to assets of discontinued operation at march  inventories declined  to  principally due to lower levels of raw material and finished goods inventories which declined  and  respectively 
the decline in raw materials inventories is attributable to reduced stocking levels associated with lower production volumes  and the reclassification of the inventory of the discontinued electronic products segment to assets of discontinued operation at march  prepaid expenses decreased to  at march  from  at march  primarily due to lower levels of prepaid software maintenance costs at the end of the current fiscal year versus the prior fiscal year end 
assets of discontinued operations was  at march  compared to nil at march  reflecting the estimated realizable value of all assets of the discontinued electronic products segment  other than cash  at march  see also note below 
we invested  for the acquisition of property and equipment during the fiscal year compared to  last fiscal year 
the decrease in capital expenditures is primarily due to a planned reduction in capital spending in our technology segment 
accounts payable declined to  at march  from  at march   primarily due to the reclassification of the accounts payable of the discontinued electronic products segment to commitments of discontinued operation at march  other current liabilities decreased  to  at march  from  at march  the decrease is primarily attributable to lower levels of accrued loss reserves on certain engineering contracts  customer deposits and the reclassification of the accrued liabilities of the discontinued electronic products segment to commitments of discontinued operation at march  liabilities and commitments of discontinued operation were  at march  compared to nil at march   reflecting the estimated liabilities of the discontinued electronic products segment including the estimated obligation for future lease payments on the manufacturing facility in st 
charles  missouri 
on may   we completed a sublease with the purchaser of the assets of our discontinued contract electronics manufacturing business for the remaining term of our lease agreement 
however  we remain the primary obligor and due to doubt regarding the sublessee s financial capability to meet its obligations under the sublease  we have recorded an estimate of the potential shortfall under our master lease  should the sublease obligation not be fully honored 
billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts decreased  to  at march  from  at march  the decrease is due to lower revenue and reduced billing rates on engineering contracts during the fiscal year ended march  versus the prior fiscal year 
long term debt  less current portion decreased  to  at march  reflecting principal repayments on the mortgage debt for our frederick  colorado facility 
common stock and additional paid in capital increased to  and  respectively  at march  compared to  and  at march  the increases were primarily attributable to completion of a secondary offering of  shares of common stock to institutional investors in north america and europe

the increase in the current year loss from continuing operations is attributable to lower revenue levels  higher levels of internally funded research and development expenditures and the inclusion in the prior two fiscal years of deferred gains on sale of real estate of  or per common share  and  or per common share  respectively 
revenue from contract services declined  or percent  to  at march  compared to  for the fiscal year ended march  primarily due to the application of additional engineering resources to internally funded research and development programs during the fiscal year 
revenue from contract services decreased  or percent  for the year ended march  compared to revenue for the year ended march  reflecting decreased activity on revenue generating programs during the second half of fiscal year product sales this fiscal year declined percent to  compared to  for the year ended march  product sales revenue for the fiscal year ended march  declined percent versus product sales revenue for the year ended march  of  mechanical products segment revenue for the year ended march  decreased  or percent  to  compared to  for fiscal year ended march  due to decreased shipments of wheelchair propulsion motors  which was partially offset by the launch of production of fan blower motors used in the air conditioning systems on a military aircraft 
we expect production of wheelchair propulsion motors to continue at current levels through november we do not expect to receive additional orders for new wheelchair production motors from invacare corporation  although orders for field service and warranty units are expected to continue for the foreseeable future 
mechanical products segment revenue for the fiscal year ended march  rose  or percent  versus revenue for the fiscal year ended march  reflecting increased shipments of wheelchair motors 
technology segment product revenue for the fiscal year ended march  increased  or percent  to  compared to  for fiscal year ended march  due to increased shipments of fuel cell air compressor drive motors and proprietary propulsion systems 
technology segment product revenue for the fiscal year ended march  decreased  or percent  versus revenue for the fiscal year ended march  reflecting reduced demand for proprietary propulsion systems 
gross profit on contract services was percent this fiscal year compared to and percent for the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively 
the increase in contract services margins for the current fiscal year versus the fiscal year ended march  is attributable to lower levels of cost overruns on certain engineering contracts this year versus the prior fiscal year period

gross profit margin on product sales this fiscal year was percent compared to percent and percent in the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively 
the decrease in margins on product sales for this fiscal year versus the prior fiscal year resulted from decreased overhead absorption associated with lower revenue levels 
the increase in margins on product sales for the fiscal year ended march  versus the fiscal year ended march  is due to reduced material costs 
research and development expenditures for the fiscal year ended march  increased to  compared to  and  for the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively 
the increase is primarily due to internally funded development of a new micro processor platform for our power electronic controls  production engineering costs and an increase in cost share type contracts 
general and administrative expense this fiscal year was  compared to  and  for the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses for this fiscal year versus last fiscal year is primarily attributable to cost reduction activities at all business units throughout the year

results of discontinued operations in january  we announced our intention to exit our contract electronics manufacturing business 
as a result  during the quarter ended march   we recorded a loss from operations of the discontinued electronic products segment of  of which  represents the loss on disposal of the segment s assets 
additionally  for all periods presented  we reclassified operating results of the electronic products segment to loss from operations of discontinued electronic products segment 
all segment assets were reclassified to the balance sheet caption assets of discontinued operation as of march  lease and commitments were recorded as a current liability under the caption liabilities and commitments of discontinued operations 
on may   we completed the divestiture of the assets of this business for  in cash and a ownership interest in the purchaser 
we have not recorded any value for the common stock of the purchaser received in this transaction 
in addition  the purchaser executed a sublease on our st 
charles  missouri manufacturing facility for the remaining term of our lease 
however  we are the primary obligor on the lease and due to doubt regarding the sublessee s financial capability to meet its obligation under the sublease  we have recorded an estimate of the potential shortfall under our master lease should payments under the sublease obligation not be fully honored 
in october  we announced our intention to exit our non core contract gear manufacturing business 
as a result  during the quarter ended september   we recorded a charge of  for the estimated loss on disposal of the gear division  which included a provision of  for expected operating losses during the phase out period 
additionally  for all periods presented  we reclassified operating results of the gear division to loss from operations of discontinued gear division  and reclassified all capital equipment and associated term debt as current under the following balance sheet captions equipment of discontinued operations held for sale  net and term debt and accrued future losses of discontinued operations  respectively 
we completed the divestiture of the contract gear manufacturing business during the first quarter of the fiscal year ended march  loss from discontinued operations for the fiscal year ended march  was  or per common share  compared to a loss from discontinued operations of  or per common share  and  or per common share  for the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources our cash balances and liquidity throughout the fiscal year ended march  were adequate to meet operating needs 
at march   we had working capital the excess of current assets over current liabilities of  compared to  at march  working capital decreased by  primarily due to the winding down of operations of our contract electronics manufacturing business 
the divestiture of our contract electronics manufacturing business  which was completed on may   generated net cash proceeds of approximately  for the year ended march  net cash used by operating activities was  compared to net cash provided by operations of  for the year ended march  the decrease is primarily attributable to higher levels of operating losses and lower levels of cash generated from reductions in accounts receivables and inventory this fiscal year versus last fiscal year 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities for the year ended march  versus the fiscal year ended march  was primarily due to cash provided from lower levels of accounts receivable and inventory 
net cash provided by investing activities for the fiscal year ended march  was  compared to cash used by investing activities of  for the previous fiscal year 
the increase in cash provided by investing activities this fiscal year was due to the sale of our ownership interest in taiwan uqm which provided net cash proceeds of  and lower levels of capital expenditures for property and equipment  facility expansion and patent and trademark costs 
net cash provided by financing activities was  for the fiscal year ended march  versus  for the comparable period last year 
the decrease is attributable to reduced proceeds from the sale of common stock and reduced proceeds from bank borrowings during the current fiscal year 
net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal rose substantially versus the fiscal level of  due to completion of a secondary offering in fiscal of million and increased bank borrowings 
our operating results and liquidity during the fiscal year were adversely impacted by the reduction in orders of a significant customer in our mechanical products segment  an adverse court ruling against our electronic products segment and our decision to divest our contract electronics manufacturing business 
our debt facilities require compliance with certain financial covenants in order for the financing to continue to be available on a long term basis 
at march  we were in compliance with all financial covenants 
in the event our operating results are not sufficient to maintain compliance with these covenants  we could experience a material adverse change in liquidity 
we expect to manage our operations and working capital requirements to minimize the future level of operating losses and working capital usage  however  we cannot provide assurance that we will be successful in achieving these objectives 
during fiscal  the emerging market for hybrid electric automobiles began to expand at an unexpected rate due to the market success of the toyota prius hybrid electric passenger car and the honda insight and civic hybrid electric passenger cars 
as a result  several auto makers have announced planned introductions of similar vehicles and others are expected to follow as the market acceptance of these vehicles continues to grow 
as a result of this industry trend  we expect expanded demand for our proprietary propulsion systems which are ideally suited for a wide range of hybrid electric vehicle platforms 
in order to capitalize on this anticipated expansion in demand  we expect to make substantial investments in human resources  manufacturing facilities and equipment  production and application engineering among other things  and the scope of these investments may exceed our currently available cash resources 
accordingly  we expect to fund our future operations from existing cash balances and from the future issuance of equity or debt securities or a combination thereof 
we can  however  not provide any assurance that financing or equity capital to fund planned operations will be available on terms acceptable to us 
in the event financing or equity capital to fund future growth is not available  we will modify our strategy to align our operations with then available financial resources 
contractual obligations the following table presents information about our contractual obligations and commitments as of march  tabular disclosure of contractual obligations payments due by period total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations executive compensation under employment agreements other long term liabilities reflected on the balance sheet under gaap total critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in united states requires management to make judgements  assumptions and estimates that effect the dollar values reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
estimates are used for but not limited to allowance for doubtful accounts receivables  costs to complete contracts  recoverability of inventories and warranty costs 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
the following critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgements  assumptions and estimates used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
accounts receivable our trade accounts receivable are subject to credit risks associated with the financial condition of our customers and their liquidity 
we evaluate all customers periodically to assess their financial condition and liquidity and set appropriate credit limits based on this analysis 
as a result  the collectibility of accounts receivable may change due to changing general economic conditions and factors associated with each customers particular business 
we have established a reserve for potentially uncollectible trade accounts receivable which is our best estimate of the amount of trade accounts receivable that we believe may become uncollectible at a future date due to the foregoing factors 
at march  we had recorded reserves for uncollectible trade accounts receivable of  it is reasonably possible  that future events or changes in circumstances could cause the realizable value of our trade accounts receivable to decline materially  resulting in material losses 
asset recovery and realization discontinued operations on may   we completed the sale of the assets of our electronic products segment 
part of the consideration received from this divestiture was common stock of the purchasing entity  a privately held corporation 
in our judgement there is doubt regarding our ability in the future to sell or otherwise liquidate the common stock of the purchasing entity  and accordingly  we recorded the stock at no value as a result of this uncertainty 
in the event we are able to realize value from the sale or liquidation of this asset at a future date  we would at that time record a gain equal to the amount of the value received 
in addition  the purchaser completed a sublease agreement with us whereby it effectively assumed the remaining lease obligation under our master lease 
similarly  in our judgement there is doubt regarding the purchaser s financial capability to meets its obligations under the sublease agreement 
accordingly  we have recorded a liability of  which represents our estimate of the potential future shortfall under our master lease should the sublease obligation not be fully honored 
this estimate could be revised either up or down depending on future events  and any such changes could result in a material impact on our financial condition  results of operation and liquidity 
inventories we maintain raw material inventories of electronic components  motor parts and other materials to meet our expected manufacturing needs for proprietary products and for products manufactured to the design specifications of our customers 
some of these components may become obsolete or impaired due to bulk purchases in excess of customer requirements 
accordingly  we periodically assesses our raw material inventory for potential impairment of value based on then available information  expectations and estimates and establish impairment reserves for estimated declines in the realizable value of our inventories 
the actual realizable value of our inventories may differ materially from these estimates based on future occurrences and any resulting change in our estimates 
it is reasonably possible  that future events or changes in circumstances could cause the realizable value of our inventories to decline materially  resulting in additional material impairment losses 
percentage of completion revenue recognition on long term contracts costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts we recognize revenue on the development projects funded by our customers using the percentage of completion method 
under this method  contract services revenue is based on the percentage that costs incurred to date bear to management s best estimate of the total costs to be incurred to complete the project 
many of these contracts involve the application of our technology to customers products and other applications with demanding specifications 
management s best estimates have sometimes been adversely impacted by unexpected technical challenges requiring additional analysis and redesign  failure of electronic components to operate in accordance with manufacturers published performance specifications  unexpected prototype failures requiring the purchase of additional parts and a variety of other factors that may cause unforeseen delays and additional costs 
it is reasonably possible that total costs to be incurred on any of the projects in process at march  could be materially different from management s estimates  and any modification of management s estimate of total project costs to be incurred could result in material changes in the profitability of affected projects or result in material losses on any affected projects 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
finr  consolidation of variable interest entities revised december 
fin addresses how a business enterprise should evaluate whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity through means other than voting rights and accordingly should consolidate the entity 
finr replaces fasb interpretation no 
consolidation of variable interest entities  which was issued in january we do not have interests in any variable interest entities  therefore  finr had no impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
this statement establishes standards for the classification and measurement of certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
the statement also includes required disclosures for financial instruments within its scope 
the statement was effective for instruments entered into or modified after may  and otherwise will be effective as of january   except for mandatorily redeemable financial instruments 
for certain mandatorily redeemable financial instruments  the statement will be effective for the company on january  the effective date has been deferred indefinitely for certain other types of mandatorily redeemable financial instruments 
we currently do not have any financial instruments that are within the scope of this statement  therefore  sfas no 
had no impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as foreign currency exchange and interest rates 
we do not use financial instruments to any degree to manage these risks and do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
all of our product sales  and related receivables are payable in us dollars 
we are subject to interest rate risk on our debt obligations 
one of our long term debt obligations has a variable rate of interest indexed to the prime rate 
the interest rate on these instruments approximates current market rates as of march  a one percent change in the prime interest rate would increase or decrease interest expense by  on an annual basis on outstanding borrowings at march  on debt with adjustable interest rate provisions
