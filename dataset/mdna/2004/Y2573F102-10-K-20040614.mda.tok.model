in addition to our sales force  executive management focuses a significant amount of attention to expanding existing  and developing new  customer relationships  thus playing an integral role in our sales efforts 
backlog although we obtain firm purchase orders from our customers  oem customers typically do not make firm orders for delivery of products more than to days in advance 
we do not believe that the backlog of expected product sales covered by firm purchase orders is a meaningful measure of future sales since customers may reschedule or cancel orders 
competition the ems industry is extremely competitive and includes many companies  several of whom have achieved substantial market share 
we compete against numerous domestic and foreign ems providers  as well as our current and prospective customers  who evaluate our capabilities in light of their own 
in recent years  we have also begun to face competition from taiwanese odm suppliers  who have a substantial share of the global market for information technology hardware production  primarily related to notebook and desktop computers and personal computer motherboards  as well as provide consumer products and other technology manufacturing services 

table of contents we compete with different companies depending on the type of service we are providing or the geographic area in which an activity is taking place 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in the segments of the ems industry in which we operate are cost  technological capabilities  responsiveness and flexibility  location of facilities  product quality  design capabilities  and range of services available 
failure to satisfy any of the foregoing requirements could seriously harm our business 
environmental regulation our operations are subject to a number of regulatory requirements relating to the use  storage  discharge  and disposal of hazardous chemicals used during the manufacturing processes 
we believe that our operations are currently in compliance in all material respects with applicable regulations and do not believe that costs of compliance with these laws and regulations will have a material effect on our capital expenditures  operating results  or competitive position 
currently we have no commitments with environmental authorities regarding any compliance related matters 
we engage an environmental consulting firm to assist us in the evaluation of environmental liabilities of our ongoing operations  historical disposal activities and closed sites in order to establish appropriate accruals in our financial statements 
we determine the amount of our accruals for environmental matters by analyzing and estimating the range of possible costs in light of information currently available 
the imposition of more stringent standards or requirements under environmental laws or regulations  the results of future testing and analysis undertaken by us at our operating facilities  or a determination that we are potentially responsible for the release of hazardous substances at other sites could result in expenditures in excess of amounts currently estimated to be required for such matters 
we do not believe that any of our potential or possible liabilities for environmental matters are material 
however  there can be no assurance that additional environmental matters will not arise in the future or that costs will not be incurred with respect to sites as to which no problem is currently known 
employees as of march   our global workforce totaled approximately  employees 
we have never experienced a work stoppage or strike  and we believe that our employee relations are good 
our success depends to a large extent upon the continued services of key managerial and technical employees 
the loss of such personnel could seriously harm our business  results of operations  prospects and debt service ability 
to date  we have not experienced significant difficulties in attracting or retaining such personnel 
although we are not aware that any of our key personnel currently intend to terminate their employment  we cannot guarantee their future services 
intellectual property we own or have licensed various united states and foreign patents related to a variety of technologies 
for certain of our proprietary processes  we rely on trade secret protection 
we also have registered our corporate name and several other trademarks and service marks that we use in our business in the united states and other countries throughout the world 
although we believe that our intellectual property assets and licenses are sufficient for the operation of our business as we currently conduct it  we cannot assure you that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us in the future 
in addition  flextronics is increasingly providing design  engineering and odm services to its customers 
as a consequence of these activities  we are required to address and allocate the ownership and responsibility for intellectual property in our customer relationships to a greater extent than in our manufacturing and assembly businesses 
if a third party were to make an assertion regarding the ownership or right to use intellectual property  we would be required to either enter into licensing arrangements or to resolve the issue through litigation 
we cannot assure you that such license rights would be available to us on commercially acceptable terms  if at all  or that any such litigation would be resolved in our favor 
additionally  we believe that litigation could be lengthy and costly and could materially harm our financial condition regardless of the outcome 
we may also be required to incur substantial costs to redesign a product or re perform design services

we were incorporated in the republic of singapore in may our principal corporate office is located at one marina boulevard   singapore our us corporate headquarters is located at fortune drive  san jose  california  risk factors if we do not effectively manage changes in our operations  our business may be harmed 
in the last ten years  we have experienced significant growth in our business through a combination of internal growth and acquisitions 
our global workforce has more than doubled in size since the beginning of fiscal year during that time  we have also reduced our workforce at some locations and closed certain facilities in connection with our restructuring activities 
these changes have placed considerable strain on our management control systems and resources  including decision support  accounting management  information systems and facilities 
if we do not continue to improve our financial and management controls  reporting systems and procedures to manage our employees effectively and to expand our facilities  our business could be harmed 
we plan to continue to transition manufacturing to lower cost locations 
we plan to increase our manufacturing capacity in our low cost regions by expanding our facilities and adding new equipment 
this expansion involves significant risks  including  but not limited to  the following we may not be able to attract and retain the management personnel and skilled employees necessary to support expanded operations  we may not efficiently and effectively integrate new operations and information systems  expand our existing operations and manage geographically dispersed operations  we may incur cost overruns  we may incur charges related to our expansion activities  we may encounter construction delays  equipment delays or shortages  labor shortages and disputes and production start up problems that could harm our growth and our ability to meet customers delivery schedules  and we may not be able to obtain funds for this expansion  and we may not be able to obtain loans or operating leases with attractive terms 
in addition  we expect to incur new fixed operating expenses associated with our expansion efforts that will increase our cost of sales  including increases in depreciation expense and rental expense 
if our revenues do not increase sufficiently to offset these expenses  our operating results could be seriously harmed 
our transition to low cost manufacturing regions has contributed to significant restructuring and other charges that have resulted from reducing our workforce and capacity at higher cost locations 
we recognized restructuring charges of approximately million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year associated with the consolidation and closure of several manufacturing facilities  and impairment of certain long lived assets at several manufacturing facilities 
we may be required to take additional charges in the future as a result of these activities 
we cannot assure you as to the timing or amount of any future restructuring charges 
if we are required to take additional restructuring charges in the future  it could have a material adverse impact on operating results  financial position and cash flows 

table of contents we depend on industries that continually produce technologically advanced products with short life cycles  our inability to continually manufacture such products on a cost effective basis could harm our business 
for fiscal year  we derived approximately of our revenues from customers in the handheld devices industry  whose products include cellular phones  pagers and personal digital assistants  approximately of our revenues from customers in the computers and office automation industry  whose products include copiers  scanners  graphic cards  desktop and notebook computers  and peripheral devices such as printers and projectors  approximately of our revenues from providers of communications infrastructure  whose products include equipment for optical networks  cellular base stations  radio frequency devices  telephone exchange and access switches  and broadband devices  approximately of our revenues from the consumer devices industry  whose products include set top boxes  home entertainment equipment  cameras and home appliances  approximately of our revenues from providers of information technologies infrastructure  whose products include servers  workstations  storage systems  mainframes  hubs and routers  and approximately of our revenues from customers in a variety of other industries  including the medical  automotive  industrial and instrumentation industries 
factors affecting these industries in general could seriously harm our customers and  as a result  us 
these factors include rapid changes in technology  which result in short product life cycles  seasonality of demand for our customers products  the inability of our customers to successfully market their products  and the failure of these products to gain widespread commercial acceptance  and recessionary periods in our customers markets 
our customers have and may continue to cancel their orders  change production quantities or locations  or delay production 
as a provider of electronics manufacturing services  we must provide increasingly rapid product turnaround for our customers 
we generally do not obtain firm  long term purchase commitments from our customers  and we often experience reduced lead times in customer orders 
customers cancel their orders  change production quantities and delay production for a number of reasons 
uncertain economic and geopolitical conditions have resulted  and may continue to result  in some of our customers delaying the delivery of some of the products we manufacture for them  and placing purchase orders for lower volumes of products than previously anticipated 
cancellations  reductions or delays by a significant customer or by a group of customers have harmed  and may continue to harm  our results of operations by reducing the volumes of products we manufactured for these customers and delivered in that period  by causing a delay in the repayment of our expenditures for inventory in preparation for customer orders and lower asset utilization resulting in lower gross margins 
in addition  customers often require that manufacturing of their products be transitioned from one facility to another to achieve cost and other objectives 
such transfers result in inefficiencies and costs due to resulting excess capacity and overhead at one facility and capacity constraints and related stresses at the other 
in addition  we make significant decisions  including determining the levels of business that we will seek and accept  production schedules  component procurement commitments  personnel needs and other resource requirements  based on our estimates of customer requirements 
the short term nature of our customers commitments and the rapid changes in demand for their products reduce our ability to estimate accurately future customer requirements 
this makes it difficult to schedule production and maximize utilization of our manufacturing capacity 
we often increase staffing  increase capacity and incur other expenses to meet the anticipated demand of our customers  which cause reductions in our gross margins if customer orders are or cancelled 
anticipated orders may not materialize  and delivery schedules may be deferred as a result of changes in demand for our customers products 
on 
table of contents occasion  customers require rapid increases in production  which stress our resources and reduce margins 
although we have increased our manufacturing capacity  and plan further increases  we may not have sufficient capacity at any given time to meet our customers demands 
in addition  because many of our costs and operating expenses are relatively fixed  a reduction in customer demand harms our gross profit and operating income 
our operating results vary significantly from period to period 
we experience significant fluctuations in our results of operations 
some of the principal factors that contribute to these fluctuations are changes in demand for our services  our effectiveness in managing manufacturing processes and costs in order to decrease manufacturing expenses  the mix of the types of manufacturing services we provide  as high volume and low complexity manufacturing services typically have lower gross margins than lower volume and more complex services  changes in the cost and availability of labor and components  which often occur in the electronics manufacturing industry and which affect our margins and our ability to meet delivery schedules  the degree to which we are able to utilize our available manufacturing capacity  our ability to manage the timing of our component purchases so that components are available when needed for production  while avoiding the risks of purchasing inventory in excess of immediate production needs  and local conditions and events that may affect our production volumes  such as labor conditions  political instability and local holidays  and changes in demand in our customers end markets 
two of our significant end markets are the handheld electronics devices market and the consumer devices market 
these markets exhibit particular strength toward the end of the calendar year in connection with the holiday season 
as a result  we have historically experienced stronger revenues in our third fiscal quarter as compared to our other fiscal quarters 
our increased original design manufacturing odm activity may reduce our profitability 
we have recently begun providing odm services  where we design and develop products that we then manufacture for oem customers 
we are actively pursuing odm projects  focusing primarily on consumer related devices  such as cellular phones and related products  which requires that we make investments in research and development  technology licensing  test and tooling equipment  patent applications  facility expansion  and recruitment 
although we enter into contracts with our odm customers  we may design and develop products for these customers prior to receiving a purchase order or other firm commitment from them 
we are required to make substantial investments in the resources necessary to design and develop these products  and no revenue may be generated from these efforts if our customers do not approve the designs in a timely manner or at all  or if they do not then purchase anticipated levels of products 
in addition  odm activities often require that we purchase inventory for initial production runs before we have a purchase commitment from a customer 
even after we have a contract with a customer with respect to an odm product  these contracts may allow the customer to delay or cancel deliveries and may not obligate the customer to any volume of purchases 
these contracts can generally be terminated by either party on short notice 
there is no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current level of odm activity at all or for an extended period of time 
due to the initial costs of investing in the resources necessary for this business  our increased odm activities adversely affected our profitability during fiscal year we continue to make investments in our odm services  which could adversely affect our profitability during fiscal year and beyond 
further  the products we design must satisfy safety and regulatory standards and some products must also receive government certifications 
if we fail to obtain these approvals or certifications on a timely basis  we would be unable to sell these products  which would harm our sales  profitability and reputation 

table of contents the success of our odm activity depends on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights 
we retain certain intellectual property rights to our odm products 
as the level of our odm activity is increasing  the extent to which we rely on rights to intellectual property incorporated into products is increasing 
despite our efforts  we cannot be certain that the measures we have taken to prevent unauthorized use of our technology will be successful 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights  this could reduce or eliminate the competitive advantages of our proprietary technology  which would harm our business 
intellectual property infringement claims against our customers or us could harm our business 
our odm products often face competition from the products of oems  many of whom may own the intellectual property rights underlying those products 
as a result  we could become subject to claims of intellectual property infringement as the number of our competitors increases 
in addition  customers for our odm services typically require that we indemnify them against the risk of intellectual property infringement 
if any claims are brought against us or our customers for such infringement  whether or not these have merit  we could be required to expend significant resources in defense of such claims 
in the event of such an infringement claim  we may be required to spend a significant amount of money to develop non infringing alternatives or obtain licenses 
we may not be successful in developing such alternatives or obtaining such a license on reasonable terms or at all 
if our odm products are subject to design defects  our business may be damaged and we may incur significant fees 
in our contracts with odm customers  we generally provide them with a warranty against defects in our designs 
if an odm product or component that we design is found to be defective in its design  this may lead to increased warranty claims 
although we have product liability insurance coverage  it is expensive and may not be available on acceptable terms  in sufficient amounts  or at all 
a successful product liability claim in excess of our insurance coverage or any material claim for which insurance coverage was denied or limited and for which indemnification was not available could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we are exposed to intangible asset risk 
we have a substantial amount of intangible assets 
these intangible assets are attributable to acquisitions and represent the difference between the purchase price paid for the acquired businesses and the fair value of the net tangible assets of the acquired businesses 
we are required to evaluate goodwill and other intangibles for impairment on at least an annual basis  and whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable from estimated future cash flows 
as a result of our annual and other periodic evaluations  we may determine that the intangible asset values need to be written down to their fair values  which could result in material charges that could be adverse to our operating results and financial position 
we may encounter difficulties with acquisitions  which could harm our business 
we have completed numerous acquisitions of businesses and we expect to continue to acquire additional businesses in the future 
we are currently in preliminary discussions with respect to potential acquisitions and strategic customer transactions  including the potential transaction with nortel networks and the definitive agreement for the acquisition of the majority ownership stake in hughes software systems described under management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview 
we do not have any other definitive agreements to make any material acquisitions or strategic customer transactions other than our agreement to acquire outstanding shares of hughes software systems limited announced in june any future acquisitions may require additional debt or equity financing 
this could increase our leverage or be dilutive to our existing shareholders 
we may not be able to complete acquisitions or strategic customer transactions in the future to the same extent as in the past  or at all 
in addition  acquisitions involve numerous risks and challenges  including difficulties in integrating acquired businesses and operations  diversion of management s attention from the normal operation of our business  potential loss of key employees and customers of the acquired companies  difficulties in managing and integrating operations in geographically dispersed locations  
table of contents lack of experience operating in the geographic market or industry sector of the acquired business  increases in our expenses and working capital requirements  which reduce our return on invested capital  and exposure to unanticipated contingent liabilities of acquired companies 
these and other factors have harmed  and in the future could harm  our ability to achieve anticipated levels of profitability at acquired operations or realize other anticipated benefits of an acquisition  and could adversely affect our business and operating results 
our strategic relationships with major customers create risks 
over the past several years  we have completed numerous strategic transactions with oem customers  including  among others  xerox  alcatel  casio and ericsson  and we are currently in discussions with respect to a potential strategic transaction with nortel networks as described under management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview 
under these arrangements  we generally acquire inventory  equipment and other assets from the oem  and lease or acquire their manufacturing facilities  while simultaneously entering into multi year supply agreements for the production of their products 
we intend to continue to pursue these oem divestiture transactions in the future 
there is strong competition among ems companies for these transactions  and this competition may increase 
these transactions have contributed to a significant portion of our revenue growth  and if we fail to complete similar transactions in the future  our revenue growth could be harmed 
as part of these arrangements  we typically enter into manufacturing services agreements with these oems 
these agreements generally do not require any minimum volumes of purchases by the oem  and the actual volume of purchases may be less than anticipated 
the arrangements entered into with divesting oems typically involve many risks  including the following we may need to pay a purchase price to the divesting oems that exceeds the value we may realize from the future business of the oem  the integration of the acquired assets and facilities into our business may be time consuming and costly  we  rather than the divesting oem  bear the risk of excess capacity at the facility  we may not achieve anticipated cost reductions and efficiencies at the facility  we may be unable to meet the expectations of the oem as to volume  product quality  timeliness and cost reductions  and if demand for the oems products declines  the oem may reduce its volume of purchases  and we may not be able to sufficiently reduce the expenses of operating the facility or use the facility to provide services to other oems 
as a result of these and other risks  we have been  and in the future may be  unable to achieve anticipated levels of profitability under these arrangements 
in addition  these strategic arrangements have not  and in the future may not  result in any material revenues or contribute positively to our earnings per share 
we depend on the continuing trend of outsourcing by oems 
future growth in our revenue depends on new outsourcing opportunities in which we assume additional manufacturing and supply chain management responsibilities from oems 
to the extent that these opportunities are not available  either because oems decide to perform these functions internally or because they use other providers of these services  our future growth would be limited 
the majority of our sales come from a small number of customers  if we lose any of these customers  our sales could decline significantly 
sales to our ten largest customers have represented a significant percentage of our net sales in recent periods 
our ten largest customers accounted for approximately and of net sales in fiscal year and fiscal year  respectively 
our largest customers during fiscal year were hewlett packard and sony ericsson  each accounting for approximately of net sales  respectively 
no other customer accounted for more than of net sales in fiscal year or fiscal year 
table of contents our principal customers have varied from year to year  and our principal customers may not continue to purchase services from us at current levels  if at all 
significant reductions in sales to any of these customers  or the loss of major customers  would seriously harm our business 
if we are not able to timely replace expired  canceled or reduced contracts with new business  our revenues could be harmed 
our industry is extremely competitive 
the ems industry is extremely competitive and includes many companies  several of which have achieved substantial market share 
current and prospective customers also evaluate our capabilities against the merits of manufacturing products themselves 
some of our competitors may have greater design  manufacturing  financial or other resources than we do 
additionally  we face competition from taiwanese odm suppliers  who have a substantial share of the global market for information technology hardware production  primarily related to notebook and desktop computers and personal computer motherboards  in addition to providing consumer products and other technology manufacturing services 
the overall demand for electronics manufacturing services decreased in recent years  resulting in increased capacity and substantial pricing pressures  which have harmed our operating results 
certain sectors of the ems industry have experienced increased price competition  and if we experience such increased level of competition in the future  our revenues and gross margin may continue to be adversely affected 
we may be adversely affected by shortages of required electronic components 
at various times  there have been shortages of some of the electronic components that we use  as a result of strong demand for those components or problems experienced by suppliers 
these unanticipated component shortages have resulted in curtailed production or delays in production  which prevented us from making scheduled shipments to customers in the past and may do so in the future 
our inability to make scheduled shipments could cause the company to experience a reduction in sales  increase in inventory levels and costs  and could adversely affect relationships with existing and prospective customers 
component shortages may also increase our cost of goods sold because we may be required to pay higher prices for components in short supply and redesign or reconfigure products to accommodate substitute components 
as a result  component shortages could adversely affect our operating results for a particular period due to the resulting revenue shortfall and increased manufacturing or component costs 
our customers may be adversely affected by rapid technological change 
our customers compete in markets that are characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards and continuous improvement in products and services 
these conditions frequently result in short product life cycles 
our success will depend largely on the success achieved by our customers in developing and marketing their products 
if technologies or standards supported by our customers products become obsolete or fail to gain widespread commercial acceptance  our business could be adversely affected 
we are subject to the risk of increased income taxes 
we have structured our operations in a manner designed to maximize income in countries where tax incentives have been extended to encourage foreign investment  or income tax rates are low 
we base our tax position upon the anticipated nature and conduct of our business and upon our understanding of the tax laws of the various countries in which we have assets or conduct activities 
however  our tax position is subject to review and possible challenge by taxing authorities and to possible changes in law  which may have retroactive effects 
we cannot determine in advance the extent to which some jurisdictions may require us to pay taxes or make payments in lieu of taxes 
several countries in which we are located allow for tax holidays or provide other tax incentives to attract and retain business 
these tax incentives expire over various periods from to and are subject to certain conditions with which we expect to comply 
we have obtained tax holidays or other incentives where available  primarily in china  malaysia and hungary 
in these three countries  we generated an aggregate of approximately billion of our total revenues for the fiscal year ended march  our 
table of contents taxes could increase if certain tax holidays or incentives are not renewed upon expiration  or tax rates applicable to us in such jurisdictions are otherwise increased 
in addition  further acquisitions of businesses may cause our effective tax rate to increase 
we conduct operations in a number of countries and are subject to risks of international operations 
the geographical distances between the americas  asia and europe create a number of logistical and communications challenges for the company 
these challenges include managing operations across multiple time zones  directing the manufacture and delivery of products across distances  coordinating procurement of components and raw materials and their delivery to multiple locations  and coordinating the activities and decisions of the core management team  which is based in a number of different countries 
facilities in several different locations may be involved at different stages of the production of a single product  leading to additional logistical difficulties 
because our manufacturing operations are located in a number of countries throughout the americas  asia and europe  we are subject to the risks of changes in economic and political conditions in those countries  including fluctuations in the value of local currencies  labor unrest and difficulties in staffing  longer payment cycles  cultural differences  increases in duties and taxation levied on our products  imposition of restrictions on currency conversion or the transfer of funds  limitations on imports or exports of components or assembled products  or other travel restrictions  expropriation of private enterprises  and a potential reversal of current favorable policies encouraging foreign investment or foreign trade by our host countries 
the attractiveness of our services to us customers can be affected by changes in us trade policies  such as most favored nation status and trade preferences for some asian countries 
in addition  some countries in which we operate  such as brazil  hungary  mexico  malaysia and poland  have experienced periods of slow or negative growth  high inflation  significant currency devaluations or limited availability of foreign exchange 
furthermore  in countries such as china and mexico  governmental authorities exercise significant influence over many aspects of the economy  and their actions could have a significant effect on us 
finally  we could be seriously harmed by inadequate infrastructure  including lack of adequate power and water supplies  transportation  raw materials and parts in countries in which we operate 
we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
we transact business in various foreign countries 
as a result  we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies 
we have currency exposure arising from both sales and purchases denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of our entities 
volatility in the exchange rates between the foreign currencies and the functional currencies of our entities could seriously harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
we try to manage our foreign currency exposure by borrowing in various foreign currencies and by entering into foreign exchange forward contracts 
mainly  we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts intended to reduce the short term impact of foreign currency fluctuations on current assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency 
these exposures are primarily  but not limited to  cash  receivables  payables and inter company balances  in currencies other than the functional currency of the operating entity 
we will first evaluate and  to the extent possible  use non financial techniques  such as currency of invoice  leading and lagging payments  receivable management or local borrowing to reduce transactions exposure before taking steps to minimize remaining exposure with financial instruments 
foreign exchange forward contracts intended to hedge forecasted transactions are treated as cash flow hedges and such contracts generally expire within three months 
the credit risk of these forward contracts is minimized since the contracts are with large financial institutions 
the gains and losses on forward contracts generally offset the gains and losses on the assets  liabilities and transactions hedged 

table of contents we depend on our executive officers and skilled management personnel 
our success depends to a large extent upon the continued services of our executive officers 
generally our employees are not bound by employment or non competition agreements  and we cannot assure you that we will retain our executive officers and other key employees 
we could be seriously harmed by the loss of any of our executive officers 
in order to manage our growth  we will need to recruit and retain additional skilled management personnel and if we are not able to do so  our business and our ability to continue to grow could be harmed 
in addition  in connection with expanding our odm activities  we must attract and retain experienced design engineers 
although we and a number of companies in our industry have implemented workforce reductions  there remains substantial competition for highly skilled employees 
our failure to recruit and retain experienced design engineers could limit the growth of our odm activities  which could adversely affect our business 
we are subject to environmental compliance risks 
we are subject to various federal  state  local and foreign environmental laws and regulations  including those governing the use  storage  discharge and disposal of hazardous substances in the ordinary course of our manufacturing process 
in addition  we are responsible for cleanup of contamination at some of our current and former manufacturing facilities and at some third party sites 
if more stringent compliance or cleanup standards under environmental laws or regulations are imposed  or the results of future testing and analyses at our current or former operating facilities indicate that we are responsible for the release of hazardous substances  we may be subject to additional remediation liability 
further  additional environmental matters may arise in the future at sites where no problem is currently known or at sites that we may acquire in the future 
currently unexpected costs that we may incur with respect to environmental matters may result in additional loss contingencies  the quantification of which cannot be determined at this time 
the market price of our ordinary shares is volatile 
the stock market in recent years has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices of technology companies 
these fluctuations have often been unrelated to or disproportionately impacted by the operating performance of these companies 
the market for our ordinary shares may be subject to similar fluctuations 
factors such as fluctuations in our operating results  announcements of technological innovations or events affecting other companies in the electronics industry  currency fluctuations and general market conditions may cause the market price of our ordinary shares to decline 
we are a defendant in several securities class action lawsuits and this litigation could harm our business whether or not determined adversely to us 
between june and august  flextronics and certain of our officers and directors were named as defendants in several securities class action lawsuits that seek an unspecified amount of damages  which were filed in the untied states district court for the southern district of new york 
these actions  which were filed on behalf of those who purchased  or otherwise acquired  flextronics ordinary shares between january  and june   including those who purchased ordinary shares in our secondary offerings on february  and january  these actions generally allege that  during this period  the defendants made misstatements to the investing public about the financial condition and prospects of flextronics 
on april   the court entered an order transferring these lawsuits to the united states district court for the northern district of california 
on july   flextronics filed a motion to dismiss on behalf of the company and its officers and directors named as defendants 
on november   the court entered an order granting defendants motion to dismiss without prejudice 
on january   plaintiffs filed an amended complaint 
flextronics motion to dismiss the amended complaint was filed on march  in may  the parties reached a tentative settlement of all claims in the lawsuit and the defendants withdrew their motion to dismiss 
the settlement would be funded entirely by funds from flextronics s officers and directors insurance 
the settlement agreement is subject to negotiation and documentation of a formal stipulation of settlement  as well as court approval 
if the settlement is not finalized  there can be no assurance we will be successful in defending the lawsuits  and  if we are unsuccessful  we may be subject to significant damages 
even if we were to be successful  defending the lawsuits may be expensive and may divert management s attention from other business concerns and harm our business 
it may be difficult to effect services of process within the united states on us or to enforce civil liabilities against us 
we are incorporated in singapore under the companies act  chapter of singapore  or singapore companies act 
some of our directors and officers reside outside the united states 
a substantial portion of the assets of flextronics international ltd 
are located outside the united states 
as a result  it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process within the united states upon us or to enforce against us in united states courts  judgments obtained in such courts predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the united states 
judgments of united states courts based upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the united states are not directly enforceable in singapore courts and there can be no assurance as to whether singapore courts will enter judgments in original actions brought in singapore courts based solely upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the united states 
item properties our facilities consist of a global network of industrial parks  regional manufacturing operations  design and engineering and product introduction centers  providing over million square feet of manufacturing capacity as of march  excluding
