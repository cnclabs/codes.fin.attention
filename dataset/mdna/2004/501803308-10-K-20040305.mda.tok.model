item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with the selected financial data and the accompanying financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed here 
factors that could contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in item business  under government regulation and factors that may affect future results and market price of common stock 
overview we are a leading developer and operator of fixed site laser vision correction centers under the brand name lasikplus 
our vision centers provide the facilities  equipment and support services for performing laser vision correction that employ advanced laser technologies to help correct nearsightedness  farsightedness and astigmatism 
we currently utilize fixed site excimer lasers manufactured by bausch lomb  visx and alcon 
in july  we began converting our vision centers to closed access facilities from open access facilities in order to obtain increased control over the quality of care we provide to our patients and greater operational growth and control of our business 
substantially all of our revenues currently are derived from lasik procedures performed in our us vision centers 
our operating costs and expenses include medical professional and license fees  including per procedure fees for the ophthalmologists performing laser vision correction and the license fees per procedure paid to equipment suppliers visx  bausch lomb and alcon direct costs of services  including center rent and utilities  equipment lease and maintenance costs  surgical supplies  center staff expense and costs related to other revenues general and administrative costs  including headquarters staff expense and other overhead costs marketing and advertising costs depreciation of equipment our vision centers have a relatively high degree of operating leverage due to the fact that many of our costs are fixed in nature 
as a result  our level of procedure volume can have a significant impact on our level of profitability 
results of operations revenues we derived substantially all of our revenues for the last three years from the delivery of lasik laser vision correction services 
our revenues in any period are primarily a function of the number of laser vision correction procedures performed and the pricing for these services 
our revenues are impacted by a number of factors  including the following our ability to generate customers through our arrangements with managed care companies  direct to consumer advertising and word of mouth referrals our mix of procedures among the different types of laser technology used by us new vision center openings and our ability to increase procedure volume at existing vision centers the availability of patient financing general economic conditions and consumer confidence levels the continued growth and increased acceptance of lasik the effect of competition and discounting practices in our industry certain states prohibit us from practicing medicine  employing ophthalmologists to practice medicine on our behalf or employing optometrists to render optometry services on our behalf 
in those states  we may contract with professional corporations to provide these services 
beginning in september  we started a process to amend our management agreements with professional corporations 
the new management agreements provide us with financial and operational control of the professional corporations 
therefore  we now consolidate the financial results for those professional corporations under the new management agreements in accordance with eitf  application of fasb statement no 
and apb opinion no 
to physician management entities and certain other entities with contractual management agreements 
this change did not have a material impact on our operating income loss  as the increase in revenue resulting from consolidation of these professional corporations is offset by a corresponding increase in medical professional fees 

table of contents the following table details the number of laser vision correction procedures performed at our consolidated vision centers 
first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter year procedure volume declined in the second half of  which we believe was a result of weakening consumer confidence and the tragedy of september th 
procedure volume rebounded in the first quarter of in a manner consistent with the seasonality experienced in prior years 
we believe that falling procedure volume for the balance of was due to further weakening in consumer confidence and rising unemployment 
we believe that improved marketing and advertising effectiveness  together with third party patient financing  and our own patient financing plan helped to grow procedure volume in over in  revenues increased by  or  to  from  in approximately  of this increase in revenues in was a result of improved pricing  and approximately  was due to higher procedure volumes 
we believe that improved marketing and advertising effectiveness  together with third party patient financing and our own patient financing plan  helped to grow procedure volume in over in  revenues declined by  or  from  in to  in in  revenues decreased by  primarily as a result of lower procedure volume as compared to the volume decrease more than offset the increase in revenue of  associated with improved price realization 
although the market for laser vision correction remains highly competitive  we have raised our average price per procedure over the last twelve quarters 
our average price per procedure has increased from in the fourth quarter of to  in the quarter ended december  in the third quarter of  we introduced custom laser vision correction technology from alcon in five of our markets  and we later upgraded our visx lasers in all our markets to perform custom procedures 
lasik procedures using custom ablation accounted for of fiscal volume  and over of fiscal revenues 
we now offer lasik using custom ablation in all of our markets and believe we can charge a premium for this more advanced technology 
our strongest quarter in terms of number of procedures performed historically has been the first quarter of the year 
we believe this is related to a number of factors  including the availability of funds under typical corporate medical flexible spending programs and the general effect of the new year season 
in  the effects of this seasonality were not as strong as we saw in prior years  due to a number of factors  including an uptick in consumer confidence 

table of contents operating costs and expenses compared to the following table shows the dollar amount of increase decrease in operating expenses from to and the percent of revenues for each period dollars in thousands increase of revenue decrease medical professional and license fees direct costs of services general and administrative expenses marketing and advertising depreciation and amortization medical professional expenses increased by approximately  in from approximately  of this increase was due to higher revenues and approximately  was due to the consolidation in for the first time of some professional corporations with whom we contract to provide medical services in those states where we cannot practice medicine 
license fees decreased by  purchasing rebates from suppliers were almost entirely offset by an increase in license fees of  due primarily to higher procedure volumes 
direct costs of services include the salary component of physician compensation for those physicians employed by us  staffing  equipment  medical supplies  and facility costs of operating laser vision correction centers 
these direct costs increased in by  compared to  largely because of an increase in provision for bad debt on patient financing of  due to higher levels of accounts receivable  financing fees of  related to third party patient financing  rent and utilities expense of  and salaries and benefits of  these increases in expenses were partially offset by a decrease in insurance of  general and administrative expenses decreased by  in as compared to  primarily as a result of the absence of warrant compensation expense of  a decrease in expenditures on professional services in of  and a decrease in insurance expenses of  warrant amortization relating to certain warrants granted to a former joint venture partner in our managed care business was completed in these decreases were partially offset by an increase in salaries and benefits of  marketing and advertising expenses decreased by  in from  primarily as a result of more cost effective media buying 
depreciation and amortization expense increased by  in from  primarily as a result of laser upgrades and the acquisition of diagnostic equipment to support custom lasik

warrant amortization was completed in  resulting in a decrease of  office equipment costs were reduced by  in state and local taxes were reduced by  in offsetting these decreases were increases in insurance costs of  and stockholder communications of  the increase in depreciation and amortization expense of  is primarily the result of the purchase of lasers and other equipment that had been previously leased 
during the third quarter of  our management implemented a restructuring plan to close unprofitable locations and to reduce operating expenses  in part by reducing staffing levels in existing markets 
we estimated the cost of the plan to be  comprised of a  restructuring charge and an  asset impairment charge for leasehold improvements  equipment and goodwill associated with the locations to be closed 
the restructuring charges included  in lease termination costs and  in severance payments for employees 
by the end of the first quarter of  the restructuring plan had been fully implemented and we released excess reserves of  relating to the restructuring plan 
other investment income decreased by  in from  primarily as a result of lower interest rates and lower average invested cash 
in august  we received a settlement payment of  from pillar point partners class action litigation 
pillar point partners a joint entity formed in by laser manufacturers visx and summit technology inc  now a subsidiary of alcon corporation collected per use royalties from all laser vision correction providers using their equipment 
the manufacturers agreed to settle the various lawsuits for million 
pillar point was dissolved in july after the federal trade commission filed an administrative complaint challenging the joint entity s existence 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities in was  exceeding expenditures in investing activities during the period to open new facilities and upgrade lasers to custom lasik technology 
in addition  in december  we completed an offering of common stock in which we raised  of equity capital 
as a result  cash and cash equivalents increased to  including million of cash maintained by our captive insurance company pursuant to statutory requirements as of december   compared to  as of december  the major use of cash in was capital expenditures in connection with opening new vision centers and upgrading equipment 

table of contents during the second quarter of  our directors initiated a program to encourage additional direct stock ownership by our senior management 
we offered loans to nine key managers and directors for the purpose of purchasing shares in the open market 
a total of  was loaned under this program  all prior to june  all current directors and officers repaid their loans in full in we maintain a  revolving credit facility with the provident bank 
in addition  we have a  credit commitment for the purpose of funding acquisitions 
the revolving credit line has a variable interest rate equal to the lender s prime rate and is secured by substantially all our assets  including a mortgage on our headquarters building in cincinnati  which we own 
as of december   no borrowings were outstanding under this credit facility 
the acquisition funding commitment has no set terms and its availability is at the sole discretion of the lender 
these credit arrangements are scheduled to expire july  our contractual obligations for future cash payments as of december  are summarized in the following table 
payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations deferred compensation total as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of  these expire in varying amounts from until approximately  of federal net operating loss carryforwards and  of state net operating loss carryforwards were acquired through an acquisition we closed in our ability to use these acquired net operating loss carryforwards is limited to approximately  per year under code section of the internal revenue code 
because we could not be certain we would realize the full benefit of these loss carryforwards  in we established a valuation reserve equal in amount to the loss carryforwards 
as discussed under critical accounting policies income taxes  a future reduction in this reserve may favorably impact our results of operations 
in december  we purchased medical equipment that was being previously leased for  this resulted in a reduction in leased equipment expense of  and an increase in depreciation expense of  in as compared to our costs associated with the opening of a new vision center generally consist of capital expenditures such as the purchase or lease of lasers  diagnostic equipment  office equipment and leasehold improvements 
in addition  we typically incur other startup expenses and pre opening advertising expenses 
generally  we estimate the costs associated with opening a new vision center to be between million and million 
actual costs will vary from vision center to vision center based upon the location of the market  the number of lasers purchased for the vision center  the site of the vision center and the level of leasehold improvements required 
our capital expenditures consist primarily of investments incurred in connection with the opening of new vision centers and equipment purchases or upgrades at existing facilities 
in january  we opened a new vision center in cleveland  ohio  in june  we opened a new vision center in indianapolis  indiana  in november  we opened a new vision center in las vegas  nevada  in december  we opened a new vision center in houston  texas  and in january  we opened a new vision center in orlando  florida 
in the third quarter of  we updated our visx lasers and diagnostic equipment to enable us to offer custom ablation in all our markets 
in addition  in the fourth quarter of  we upgraded our bausch lomb lasers to offer their recently approved zyoptix tm custom technology 
the cost of our laser and equipment upgrades and vision center expansion plans resulted in capital expenditures of  which was funded by cash flow from operations 
we recently expanded the use of our own sponsored patient financing 
as of december   we had million in accounts receivable  net of allowance for doubtful accounts  which is an increase of million since december  further growth in accounts receivable is expected 
our consolidated cash and cash equivalents includes million of cash maintained by our consolidated captive insurance company pursuant to statutory requirements as of december  these funds are not available for general corporate purposes 
we expect cash reserves in our captive insurance company to grow over time 

table of contents the ability to fund our marketing and advertising program  planned capital expenditures and new vision center rollouts depends on our future performance  which  to a certain extent  is subject to general economic  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 
we believe that cash flow from operations  available cash including that from our december public offering and short term investments and available borrowing under our credit facility provide sufficient cash reserves and liquidity to fund our working capital needs  capital expenditures and debt service requirements 
critical accounting policies accounts receivable we provide patient financing to some of our customers  including those who could not otherwise obtain third party financing 
the terms of the financing require the patient to pay an up front fee which is intended to cover some or all of our variable costs  and the remainder is deducted automatically from the patient s checking account over a period of to months 
we began our patient financing program in may accounts receivable for patients that we finance for a period of months or less are recorded at the undiscounted total expected payments less an estimated allowance for doubtful accounts 
for patients we finance with an initial term over months  we record the present value of expected payments discounted at a rate of percent per year 
the discount rate assumption is based upon current market rates charged by other providers of unsecured credit to similar customers 
interest income is recorded over the term of the payment program 
as of december   the discount in receivables with an initial term over months was  allowance for doubtful accounts as a result of an expansion of the amount of patient financing provided in  we are exposed to more credit risk than we have experienced in the past 
based upon our own experience with patient financing and based upon the credit experience of lenders that provide financing to customers similar to ours  we have established bad debt reserves as of december  of  against accounts receivable of  to the extent that our actual bad debt writeoffs are greater than our estimated bad debt reserve  it would adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows and to the extent that our actual bad debt write offs are less than our estimated bad debt reserve  it would favorably impact our results of operations and cash flows 
captive insurance company reserves effective december   we established a captive insurance company to provide professional liability insurance coverage for claims brought against us after december  in addition  our captive insurance company s charter allows it to provide professional liability insurance for our doctors  some of whom are currently insured by the captive 
our captive insurance company is managed by an independent insurance consulting and management firm  and it is capitalized and funded by us based on actuarial studies performed by an affiliate of the consulting and management firm 
for the months ending december   our captive insurance company purchased excess liability coverage for of our losses in the year in excess of  per occurrence  up to  our captive insurance company is responsible for of our aggregate losses in excess of  up to  under that arrangement  the coverage providers obligation arises only after our captive pays the first  of any loss and the coverage providers are then only obligated to pay an aggregate of  in a given policy year 
beginning december   the company elected to use the captive insurance company for both the primary insurance and the excess liability coverage 
the captive insurance company continues to be funded at a rate determined by actuarial studies performed by an independent consulting firm 
a number of claims covered by our captive insurance company are now pending 
the financial statements of the captive insurance company are consolidated with our financial statements since it is a wholly owned enterprise 
as of december   we recorded an insurance reserve amount of  which primarily represents an actuarially determined estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported 
to the extent that our actual claim experience is greater than our estimated insurance reserve  it would adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows and to the extent that our actual claim experience is less than our estimated insurance reserve  it would favorably impact our results of operations and cash flows 
income taxes as a result of our operating loss during the third quarter of and throughout  and continuing uncertainties regarding the general economic conditions in the united states and the impact on our ongoing operations  we continue to record a full valuation reserve for deferred tax assets 
this reserve was established according to the requirements of sfas no 
accounting for income taxes 
favorable changes in our operating profitability  as a result of improved general economic conditions in the united states or otherwise  could impact our determination as to whether reduction  in whole or in part  to the valuation reserve is necessary in the future 
to the extent that such a reduction in the valuation reserve is necessary  an income tax benefit would be recorded in the consolidated statement of operations  which would favorably impact our results of operations 
in addition  future taxable income may be absorbed by the net operating loss carryforwards that we maintain  which would favorably impact our results of operations and cash flows 
during the twelve months ended december   we applied approximately  of our net operating losses 
table of contents against our taxable income for the period  which resulted in reduced federal income tax expenses and tax payments of approximately  the valuation reserve and net operating loss carryforwards were  and  respectively  as of december  consolidation we use the consolidation method to report our investment in our subsidiaries and other companies when we own a majority of the voting stock of the subsidiary 
in addition  we consolidate the results of operations of professional corporations with which we contract to provide the services of ophthalmologists or optometrists at our vision centers  in accordance with eitf  application of fasb statement no 
and apb opinion no 
to physician management entities and certain other entities with contractual management arrangements 
prior to september  our contractual management arrangements did not permit consolidation of our relationships with professional corporations pursuant to eitf because we did not maintain a controlling financial interest in the professional corporations 
beginning in september  we began a process of renewing our agreements with the professional corporations and opening new vision centers with agreements that meet the controlling financial interest criteria of eitf as a result of the fasb s issuance of fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
 in january  we evaluated the contractual management arrangements entered into with professional corporations after january  and have determined that consolidation of these entities was appropriate under the fin guidance 
with respect to the three remaining professional corporations with which we had a contractual management arrangement prior to january   we began consolidating these entities as of july   which did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
if modifications are made to existing management agreements  or if new agreements are made under different terms than existing management agreements  then the financial statements of the professional corporations may not be consolidated in the future 
the professional corporations do not have any material assets or debt obligations and do not materially increase our exposure to risk of loss 
cautionary statement concerning forward looking statements information contained above in this management s discussion and analysis and elsewhere in this annual report on form k with respect to expected financial results and future events and trends is forward looking  based on our estimates and assumptions and subject to risks and uncertainties 
for those statements  we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward looking statements contained in the private securities litigation reform act of item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the carrying values of financial instruments including cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  and accounts payable approximate fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments 
we have a very low exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and  as such  have not used derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency fluctuation risk
