the most significant item affecting financial results was the provision for loan losses  which totaled million in  an increase of million over the million provision for loan losses in credit quality issues made a challenging year for the company 
high levels of nonperforming loans with associated charge offs and increases to the allowance for loan losses significantly impacted financial results

in addition  the company s management placed a renewed focus on risk management  from both a corporate and credit perspective 
this included expansion of the position formerly known as chief credit officer to chief risk officer 
the company has committed substantial resources to credit administration and underwriting functions with the goal of increasing consistency among subsidiary banks in reporting and grading loans  and strengthening the review and oversight of subsidiary bank lending and credit administration at the holding company level 
the company s future challenges include managing existing credit quality issues as well as continuing to strengthen and standardize the current loan underwriting process 
significant resources have been invested in building an infrastructure necessary to manage the current credit issues and to support future growth 
management is now faced with the challenge of leveraging that infrastructure to grow revenues by investing in quality assets 
critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and are consistent with predominant practices in the financial services industry 
application of critical accounting policies  which are those policies that management believes are the most important to the company s financial position and results  requires management to make estimates  assumptions  and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes and are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements 
future changes in information may affect these estimates  assumptions and judgments  which  in turn  may affect amounts reported in the financial statements 
the company has numerous accounting policies  of which the most significant are presented in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
these policies  along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes and in this discussion  provide information on how significant assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses are reported in the consolidated financial statements and how those reported amounts are determined 
based on the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods  assumptions  and estimates underlying those amounts  management has determined that the accounting policies with respect to the allowance for loan losses and goodwill require particularly subjective or complex judgments important to the company s financial position and results of operations  and  as such  are considered to be critical accounting policies as discussed below 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the use of subjective measurements including management s assessment of the internal risk classifications of loans  changes in the nature of the loan portfolio  industry concentrations and the impact of current local  regional and national economic factors on the quality of the loan portfolio 
changes in these estimates and assumptions are reasonably possible and may have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements  results of operations or liquidity 
for additional discussion related to the company s accounting policies for the allowance for loan losses  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
goodwill statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets prescribes the accounting for goodwill and intangible assets subsequent to initial recognition 
the provisions of sfas no 
discontinue the amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives 
instead  these assets are subject to at least an annual impairment review  and more frequently if certain impairment indicators are in evidence 
changes in the estimates and assumptions used to evaluate impairment may have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements  results of operations or liquidity 
during  the company evaluated goodwill for impairment using a discounted cash flow analysis and determined no impairment existed

such yields and rates were derived by dividing interest income or expense by the average balances of interest earning assets or interest bearing liabilities  respectively  for the years shown 
tax equivalent adjustments have been made 
all average balances are average daily balances 
nonaccrual loans are included in the yield calculations in this table

lost interest on the higher levels of nonaccrual loans has also contributed to the decline in loan portfolio yield 
total average interest bearing liabilities were billion for the year ended december  representing a million increase over and represented approximately of the average increased funding required to support the growth in average earning assets 
the principal funding source for the average earning asset growth was deposits  with the average for the year ended december  increasing million or over the average for the same period in net interest margin declined in  as general market interest rates declined to historically low levels 
as overall interest rates have continued to remain low  the company s yields on earning assets declined in more rapidly than the cost of funds

net noninterest bearing funding sources represent the amount of zero interest cost funds such as demand deposits and equity that are available to fund earning assets after funding non interest earning assets 
coupling the zero interest funding sources with interest bearing liabilities results in a total cost of funds for the company in of  down basis points from the total cost of funds of

fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  was issued in november fasb interpretation no 
elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
it also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of fasb interpretation no 
are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  the company has provided the required disclosures 
the company adopted the recognition and measurement provisions of fasb interpretation no 
effective january  the adoption did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
requires that certain financial instruments  which under previous guidance could be accounted for as equity  be accounted for as liabilities 
financial instruments affected include mandatorily redeemable securities  certain financial instruments that require or may require the issuer to buy back some of its shares in exchange for cash or other assets and certain obligations that can be settled with shares of stock 
sfas no 
is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  for all other financial instruments 
the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 
on july  the adoption did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
the objective of this interpretation is to provide guidance on how to identify a variable interest entities vie and determine when the assets  liabilities  non controlling interests  and results of operations of a vie need to be included in a company s consolidated financial statements 
fin was effective for all vies created after january  however  the fasb postponed that effective date to december  in december  the fasb issued a revised fin fin r which further delayed the effective date until march  for vie s created prior to february  the requirements of fin r resulted in the deconsolidation of the company s wholly owned subsidiary trust  formed to issue mandatorily redeemable preferred securities trust preferred securities 
the deconsolidation  as of december   results in the derecognition of the million of trust preferred securities and the recognition of junior subordinated debentures of million and investment in the subsidiary trust of  in the company s consolidated statement of financial position 
in december  the fasb issued a revision of sfas no 
 employers disclosure about pensions and other post retirement benefits to expand disclosure requirements to include descriptions of plan assets  investment strategy  measurement dates  plan obligations  cash flows and components of net periodic benefit cost recognized during interim periods 
the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 as revised  on december  required disclosures have been made in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
liquidity the objective of maintaining adequate liquidity is to assure the ability of the company and its subsidiaries to meet their financial obligations 
these obligations include the withdrawal of deposits on demand or at their contractual maturity  the repayment of borrowings as they mature  the ability to fund new and existing loan commitments and the ability to take advantage of new business opportunities 
the company and its subsidiaries achieve liquidity by maintaining a strong base of core customer funds  maturing short term assets  the ability to sell securities  lines of credit  and access to capital markets 
liquidity at the subsidiary bank level is managed through the monitoring of anticipated changes in loans  the investment portfolio  core deposits and wholesale funds 
the strength of the subsidiary bank s liquidity position is a result of its base of core customer deposits 
these core deposits are supplemented by wholesale funding sources that include credit lines with the other banking institutions  the fhlb  farmer mac and the federal reserve bank 
the primary source of liquidity for the parent company is dividends from subsidiaries  lines of credit  and access to capital markets 
dividends from subsidiaries are limited by various regulatory requirements related to capital adequacy and earnings trends 
the company s subsidiaries rely on cash flows from operations  core deposits  borrowings  short term liquid assets  and  in the case of non banking subsidiaries  funds from the parent company 
the company s cash and cash equivalents were million at december   an increase of million from the balance of million at december  the principal sources of cash from financing activities were million from the net increase in deposits  offset by million of net decrease in borrowings and million in dividend payments 
the principal source of net cash from operating activities is the company s net income of million and loan sale proceeds 
the company utilized its cash in the following investing activities million in the net acquisition of securities  million in the net origination of loans and million in the purchase of premises and equipment 
an additional source of liquidity to the company is provided from its ability to limit its investing activities and or dispose of its securities and loans 
additional liquidity can be provided to the company through limiting the growth in loans by offering terms and pricing that would not be competitive 
securities available for sale and newly originated loans could be sold to provide additional liquidity 
the fair value of assets being sold is dependent upon market conditions at the time of sale and potentially could adversely affect the company s earnings 
contractual obligations the following table presents the company s contractual obligations as of december  less than more than total year years years years operating leases    long term borrowings     junior subordinated debentures   total obligations     off balance sheet arrangements the company has an off balance sheet arrangement  which includes the guarantee of distributions  and payments for redemption or liquidation of trust preferred securities issued by a wholly owned  deconsolidated subsidiary trust to the extent of funds held by the trust 
although the guarantee is not separately recorded  the obligation underlying the guarantee is fully reflected on the company s consolidated statement of financial condition as junior subordinated debentures 
the subsidiary s trust preferred securities currently qualify as tier capital under the federal reserve capital adequacy guidelines 
for further information regarding the junior subordinated debentures issued to unconsolidated subsidiary trust  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in the normal course of business  the company has outstanding commitments to extend credit  which are not reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements 
the commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
at december  letters of credit totaling million and unused loan commitments of million were contractually available 
comparable amounts for these commitments at december  were million and million  respectively 
the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements as many of the commitments are expected to expire without funding 
for further information regarding the outstanding loan commitments  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
capital resources the federal reserve board has adopted a system using risk based capital guidelines to evaluate the capital adequacy of bank holding companies 
the guidelines require a minimum total risk based capital ratio of 
leverage ratio is also utilized in assessing capital adequacy with a minimum requirement that can range from to 
the following table reflects the changes in the components of those ratios dollars in thousands total shareholders equity    less unrealized gains losses on securities available or sale    disallowed goodwill and other intangible assets    plus minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries qualifying trust preferred securities    total tier capital    adjusted average assets    tier leverage ratio total tier capital    plus qualifying allowance for loan losses    nonqualifying trust preferred securities  total risk based capital    net risk weighted assets    total risk based capital ratio the company s tier leverage ratio was at december  the ratio increased slightly from at december  total tier capital of million at december  increased million from million at december  the increase in tier capital relates primarily to the increase in retained earnings resulting from net income of million and reduced by million in preferred and common dividends declared during the company s total risk weighted capital ratio was at december  the ratio increased from at december  total risk based capital was million at december  an increase of million from million at december  the increase is primarily attributed to the million increase in tier capital previously discussed plus the slight increase in qualifying allowance for loan losses 
in addition  the formal agreements entered into by nbg and bnb with their primary regulator required both banks to develop capital plans enabling them to achieve  by march   a tier leverage capital ratio equal to  a tier risk based capital ratio equal to  and a total risk based capital ratio of 
each of the banks meets the required levels at december  for further information regarding regulatory capital  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk the principal objective of the company s interest rate risk management is to evaluate the interest rate risk inherent in certain assets and liabilities  determine the appropriate level of risk to the company given its business strategy  operating environment  capital and liquidity requirements and performance objectives  and manage the risk consistent with the guidelines approved by the company s board of directors 
the company s senior management is responsible for reviewing with the board its activities and strategies  the effect of those strategies on the net interest margin  the fair value of the portfolio and the effect that changes in interest rates will have on the portfolio and exposure limits 
senior management develops an asset liability policy that meets strategic objectives and regularly reviews the activities of the subsidiary banks 
each subsidiary bank board adopts an asset liability policy within the parameters of the overall fii asset liability policy and utilizes an asset liability committee comprised of senior management of the bank under the direction of the bank s board 
the matching of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring the company s interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or re price within that time period 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or re pricing within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or re pricing within that same time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets 
at december   the one year gap position  representing the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or re pricing within one year and interest bearing liabilities maturing or re pricing within one year  was a positive million  or of total assets 
accordingly  over the one year period following december   the company will have an estimated million more in assets re pricing than liabilities 
generally if rate sensitive assets re price sooner than rate sensitive liabilities  earnings will be positively impacted in a rising rate environment 
conversely  in a declining rate environment  earnings will generally be negatively impacted 
if rate sensitive liabilities re price sooner than rate sensitive assets then generally earnings will be negatively impacted in a rising rate environment 
conversely  in a declining rate environment earnings will generally be positively impacted 
management believes that the positive gap position at december  will not have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
gap analysis the following table the gap table sets forth the amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at december  which management anticipates  based upon certain assumptions  to re price or mature in each of the future time periods shown 
except as stated below  the amount of assets and liabilities shown which re price or mature during a particular period were determined in accordance with the earlier of the re pricing date or the contractual maturity of the asset or liability 
the table sets forth an approximation of the projected re pricing of assets and liabilities at december   on the basis of contractual maturities  anticipated prepayments and scheduled rate adjustments within the selected time intervals 
all non maturity deposits demand deposits and savings deposits were assumed to become rate sensitive over time  with     and of such deposits assumed to re price in the periods of less than days  to days  to days  to years  to years and more than years  respectively 
prepayment and re pricing rates can have a significant impact on the estimated gap 
while management believes the assumptions used in modeling the gap table are reasonable  there can be no assurance that assumed prepayment and re pricing rates will approximate actual future activity 
gap table december  volumes subject to repricing within non dollars in thousands days days days years years years sensitive total interest earning assets federal funds sold and and interest bearing deposits   investment securities        loans         total interest earning assets         interest bearing liabilities interest bearing checking  savings and money market deposits        certificates of deposit        borrowed funds        total interest bearing liabilities        period gap         cumulative gap        period gap to total assets cumulative gap to total assets cumulative interest earning assets to cumulative interest bearing liabilities amounts shown include the amortized cost of held to maturity securities and the fair value of available for sale securities 
amounts shown include principal balance net of deferred loan fees and costs  unamortized premiums and discounts 
amounts shown include junior subordinated debentures 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the gap table 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as adjustable rate loans  have features which restrict changes in interest rates  both on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
further  in the event of changes in interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table 
as a result of these shortcomings  the company directs more attention on simulation modeling  such as net interest income at risk discussed below  rather than gap analysis 
even though the gap analysis reflects a ratio of cumulative gap to total assets within acceptable limits  the net interest income at risk simulation modeling is considered by management to be more informative in forecasting future income at risk 
net interest income at risk analysis in addition to the gap analysis  management uses a rate shock simulation to measure the rate sensitivity of the balance sheet 
rate shock simulation is a modeling technique used to estimate the impact of changes in rates on net interest income and economic value of equity 
the following table sets forth the results of the modeling analysis at december  change in interest net interest income economic value of equity rates in basis points rate shock amount change change amount change change dollars in thousands static   the company measures net interest income at risk by estimating the changes in net interest income resulting from instantaneous and sustained parallel shifts in interest rates of different magnitudes over a period of months 
as of december   a basis point increase in rates would increase net interest income by million  or  over the next twelve month period 
a basis point decrease in rates would decrease net interest income by million  or  over a twelve month period 
this simulation is based on management s assumption as to the effect of interest rate changes on assets and liabilities and assumes a parallel shift of the yield curve 
it also includes certain assumptions about the future pricing of loans and deposits in response to changes in interest rates 
further  it assumes that delinquency rates would not change as a result of changes in interest rates  although there can be no assurance that this will be the case 
while this simulation is a useful measure as to net interest income at risk due to a change in interest rates  it is not a forecast of the future results and is based on many assumptions that  if changed  could cause a different outcome
