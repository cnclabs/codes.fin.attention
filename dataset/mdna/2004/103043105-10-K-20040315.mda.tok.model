overview the company began with a high degree of uncertainty in each of its businesses 
the financial printing segment had just experienced the weakest six months of capital market activity in the past decade 
with the impending war in iraq  there was little to suggest improvement 
this segment s digital printing group  bowne enterprise solutions  was coping with continuing contraction in its largest customer group the mutual fund industry and the challenges of introducing new customized communications solutions to an uncertain financial services market 
bowne global solutions had completed the acquisition of berlitz globalnet  but was continuing to integrate the two organizations while also addressing integration related customer relations and retention issues 
bowne business solutions had just acquired decisionquest  further strengthening the suite of litigation support services provided by its outsourcing business  however  this business had also experienced the dissolution of two large legal clients and a weak capital market that depressed its investment banking business 
the company entered the year with the need to strengthen its capital structure and maximize its performance during unpredictable times 
discussions began in march to renegotiate the covenants with its banks and private note holders 
the resulting amendment enabled the company to maintain its long term strategy through and comfortably meet the terms of its credit facilities even with the market uncertainties 
the company also concluded it was carrying too much senior debt as a result of its acquisition of decisionquest and globalnet 
in response  the company executed a million convertible subordinated debt offering that reduced its reliance on its senior revolving credit facility 
the resulting capital structure provides stability and lowers the company s exposure to increases in borrowing rates 
within operations  bowne continued to pursue process improvements throughout the company and sought to increase efficiencies while controlling capital expenditures 
as a result of the anemic conditions of capital markets in the first half of the year  the company further reduced staffing and resources that supported financial printing 
these actions resulted in further restructuring charges of million in the financial printing segment in and brought total reductions in annual fixed costs within this segment to more than million since the fourth quarter of the company s continued integration and reductions within bowne global solutions resulted in restructuring charges of million within the globalization segment 
the results of these actions were as follows financial printing 
in large part due to restructuring within the financial printing segment  segment profits in the fourth quarter of rose million  or  compared to the same period in the prior year 
comparing the stronger second half of with the same period in  revenues increased million  or  with segment profits increasing million  or 
more importantly  the leverage of having a more efficient operating model gives the company confidence that profitability could improve rapidly as capital markets continue to rebound

as a result  the company took several steps over the last three years to reduce fixed costs  eliminate redundancies  and better position the company to respond to market pressures or unfavorable economic conditions 
the following table summarizes the amounts incurred for restructuring  integration and asset impairment charges for each segment over the last three years financial printing outsourcing globalization corporate total after tax impact per share impact the actions taken in are estimated to result in additional annualized savings of approximately to million 
since beginning its cost cutting initiatives in the fourth quarter of  the company has reduced its annual cost base for continuing operations by approximately to million through december  much of the expense reductions within the financial printing segment are the result of the elimination of redundant staff and facilities that the company maintained while it was bringing new technology solutions and manufacturing capacity on line to support the unprecedented growth in transactional financial print work during the period from through the company does not anticipate the need to replace this staff or the closed facilities in order to respond to a recovery in the capital markets  therefore yielding a higher degree of operating leverage and allowing the company to increase productivity in such a recovery 
the company believes the current financial print model has the capacity to support transactional revenues in the range of million without adding fixed costs 
in addition to the cost reductions in its financial printing segment  the company has also made workforce reductions in its outsourcing and globalization segments to better respond to fluctuations in demand in those markets and to integrate the acquisitions of mendez and globalnet into the existing bgs operation 
further discussion of the restructuring activities is included in the segment information which follows  as well as in note to the consolidated financial statements

the acquisition of globalnet strengthened bgs s position in the globalization and localization industry and enhanced bgs s results by enabling bgs to combine complementary services  improve efficiencies  and diversify its customer base 
in december  the company acquired decisionquest  a provider of litigation resources  including trial research  strategic communications and strategic marketing  for approximately million in cash 
the acquisition of decisionquest enabled bbs to provide a broader and deeper array of outsourced services to the legal industry 
with regard to future acquisition activity  the company will continue to evaluate potential acquisition candidates in areas that will enhance its existing businesses 
the company also completed two other transactions in the third quarter of that affect comparability of results 
the company sold certain publishing assets and liabilities in its financial printing segment  resulting in a pre tax gain of   after tax  or per share 
the company also completed the sale of the chicago office building  resulting in a pre tax gain of   after tax  or per share

segment performance is evaluated exclusive of interest  income taxes  amortization  certain shared corporate expenses  restructuring  integration and asset impairment charges  disposal of certain assets  other expenses and other income 
segment profit and segment profit less depreciation expense are measured because management believes that such information is useful in evaluating the results of certain segments relative to other entities that operate within these industries and to its affiliated segments 
in the first quarter of  the company changed the manner in which it reports and evaluates segment information 
the company now reports certain administrative  legal  finance  and other support services which are not directly attributable to the segments in the category corporate other

declining volumes can be offset somewhat through monthly minimum charges on certain contracts  as well as contract language that calls for the removal of underutilized assets such as copier machines 
at the same time  the company expects that additional outsourcing opportunities from new clients will become more prevalent as businesses continue to focus on core competencies and look for cost effective alternatives to managing their document and infrastructure requirements 
in addition  strategic investments in digital litigation services such as electronic data services are projected to drive additional revenue growth in products such as the recently announced rapidview tm  a web based document hosting capability that makes lawsuit discovery easier and more cost effective for litigation teams  present a significant growth opportunity for the outsourcing segment

full year revenues to billion financial print to million outsourcing to million globalization to million segment profit financial print to million outsourcing to million globalization to million corporate other to million restructuring charges to million depreciation and amortization to million interest expense to million diluted earnings per share to diluted earnings per share  excluding restructuring charges to capital expenditures to million liquidity and capital resources liquidity and cash flow information working capital current ratio to to to net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in provided by financing activities capital expenditures acquisitions  net of cash acquired average days sales outstanding on december   the company had a current ratio of to and working capital of  on december   the company had a current ratio of to and working capital of  the decrease in working capital of  results from several factors 
a decrease of approximately million in working capital is due to an increase in accrued employee compensation and benefits as a result of a higher current portion of the pension and other retirement plan liabilities  as well as higher accrued incentive compensation as of december  compared to december  in addition  there was an approximately million decrease in working capital due to a lower level of cash and a decline in prepaid expenses and other current assets as of december  as compared to december  these decreases in working capital were offset by an increase in accounts receivable of approximately million due 
table of contents to higher revenue in the fourth quarter ended december  as compared to december   as well as a smaller balance in accrued restructuring charges at december   which was lower by approximately million 
on september   the company completed a million private placement of convertible subordinated debentures due october  the proceeds from this private placement were used to pay down a portion of the company s revolving credit facility and to repurchase a portion of the senior notes 
the company may redeem any portion of the debentures in cash on or after october  at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional interest  if any  up to  but not including the redemption date 
in addition  each holder of the debentures may require the company to repurchase all or any portion of that holder s debentures on each of october   october   october   october  and october   or in the event of a change in control as that term is defined in the indenture for the debentures  at a purchase price equal to of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional interest  if any  up to  but not including the redemption date 
the company would pay the repurchase price for any debentures repurchased on october  in cash 
the company would have the option of paying the repurchase price of any debentures repurchased on october   october   october   or october  in cash  shares of the company s common stock  or a combination of cash and shares of common stock 
in february  the company completed a million private placement of senior notes with several institutional lenders 
the notes have an approximate interest rate of including the impact of amendments and prepayments  with payments required between january and january the proceeds from the private placement were used to pay down a portion of the company s revolving credit facility 
the outstanding balance under these notes was million at december  the company completed its three year million revolving credit facility on july  amended in march and september 
in october  the commitment under this facility was permanently reduced to million 
the outstanding balance under this facility was million at december  the terms of the senior notes and revolving credit agreement provide certain limitations on additional indebtedness  sale and leaseback transactions  asset sales and certain other transactions 
additionally  the company is subject to certain financial covenants based on its results of operations 
the senior notes and revolving credit agreement are guaranteed by substantially all of the company s subsidiaries 
the debentures are unsecured obligations and are subordinated in right of payment to all of the company s existing and future senior debt 
the debentures are not guaranteed by any of the company s subsidiaries and are effectively subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of the company s subsidiaries  including trade creditors 
the company is not subject to any financial covenants under the debentures 
due to the continued economic downturn and impact on the company s business  the revolving credit agreement and senior notes were amended in march to modify certain financial covenant requirements and definitions 
under the terms of these amendments  the company is required to meet revised leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios from the first quarter of through the first quarter of these financial covenant requirements were further revised as a result of the september amendments described below 
the new covenants are less restrictive than the previously existing covenants 
the company was in compliance with all loan covenants as amended as of december  based upon its current projections  the company believes it will be in compliance with the revised quarterly loan covenants throughout fiscal year in the event that actual results do not approximate forecasted results  management believes it could execute contingency plans to mitigate any adverse impact 
such plans include additional cost reductions  asset sales  or seeking additional alternative financing 
while the company believes that it could obtain any requisite additional financing  there can be no assurance that such financing would be available on a timely basis or on acceptable terms 
in consideration for the march amendments  the company agreed to provide accounts receivable as collateral 
the collateral will be shared proportionally between the parties to the revolving credit agreement and the senior notes 
in addition  interest rates charged under the revolving credit agreement increased to libor plus basis points depending on certain leverage ratios as defined in the credit agreement  
table of contents compared to libor plus basis points under the previously existing covenants 
interest rates charged under the senior notes increased by basis points during the amendment period and a subsequent period during which the company must meet the original covenant requirements this rate increase was made permanent by the september amendment described below 
the company paid an amendment fee to approving lenders and other costs aggregating approximately million  which is being amortized to interest expense over the period covered by the amendment 
in september  the company entered into an amendment to the revolving credit facility  that  among other things  i provided for the permanent reduction of the credit facility by at least million to the extent that net proceeds from the issuance of the debentures were used to reduce the company s borrowings under the facility  ii modified the permitted leverage ratio under the facility  and iii added provisions relating to the repayment and modification of subordinated debt  and approved the subordination provisions of the recently issued debentures 
also in september  the company entered into an additional amendment for the senior notes that  among other things  i made the existing temporary increase in interest rates permanent  ii made a new temporary increase in interest rates of basis points  which will remain in effect until the company obtains an investment grade rating with respect to the senior notes  iii gave the holders of the senior notes a put option exercisable during the six months immediately prior to october   the first date on which holders of the debentures may require the company to repurchase the debentures  iv adjusted the fixed charge coverage ratio test to be to as of the fourth quarter of and for the remaining life of the senior notes  v added a debt to ebitda ratio test of to and a senior debt to ebitda ratio test of to in the covenant that limits the company s ability to incur indebtedness  and vi removed a million limitation on potential acquisitions consummated before march  it is expected that the cash generated from operations  working capital and the company s borrowing capacity will be sufficient to fund its development and integration needs both foreign and domestic  finance future acquisitions  if any  and capital expenditures  provide for the payment of dividends  and meet its debt service requirements 
the company experiences certain seasonal factors with respect to its borrowing needs  the heaviest period for borrowing is normally the second quarter 
the company s existing borrowing capacity provides for this seasonal increase 
capital expenditures for the year ended december  were  for the full year  the company plans capital spending of approximately to million 
cash flows the company s focus on cash management continues  including managing receivables and inventory 
year to date average days sales outstanding improved to days in from days in the company had net cash provided by operating activities of   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the reduction in net cash provided by operating activities in reflects a significant increase in accounts receivable as compared to a significant decrease in the prior year when excluding the effect of acquisitions 
net cash provided by operating activities in was also reduced by a significant decrease in accrued expenses  primarily caused by a decline in the accrued restructuring balance during  while there was a significant increase in that balance in net cash provided by operating activities in reflected an increase in accrued expenses  as opposed to a decrease in that line item in this change was primarily caused by higher accruals for restructuring charges 
offsetting this was a smaller decrease in accounts receivable than experienced in  and a slight increase in inventory in as opposed to a decrease in the prior year 
overall  cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations decreased by almost million from to however  cash used in discontinued operations in was almost million lower than in net cash used in investing activities was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the change from to was primarily the result of less cash used in the acquisition of businesses in the current year  which is offset partially by the proceeds recognized on the sale of certain printing assets and the chicago building in cash used in the purchase of property  plant  
table of contents and equipment during the year ended december  was also  less than in the comparable period in the change from to was primarily due to the proceeds recognized on the sale of certain printing assets and the chicago building in and a decreased level of capital expenditures in compared to this was offset partially by a higher amount of cash paid in connection with the globalnet and decisionquest acquisitions than for the acquisitions of mendez and dms 
net cash used in provided by financing activities was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the change in compared to primarily resulted from net repayments of debt in  as compared to net borrowings in  partially offset by slightly higher proceeds from stock option exercises in the change in from primarily resulted from slightly higher net borrowings in  as compared to  as well as slightly higher proceeds from stock option exercises 
contractual obligations  commercial commitments  and off balance sheet arrangements as previously discussed  the company s debt consists primarily of the convertible subordinated debentures issued in the private placement in september  the senior unsecured notes issued in the private placement in february and the outstanding amounts under its revolving credit facility 
the company also leases equipment under leases that are accounted for as capital leases  where the equipment and related lease obligation are recorded on the company s balance sheet 
the company and its subsidiaries also occupy premises and utilize equipment under operating leases that expire at various dates through the obligations under these operating leases are not recorded on the company s balance sheet in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
many of these leases provide for payment of certain expenses and contain renewal and purchase options 
the company had a synthetic lease for printing equipment in the united states and canada which was funded through a master lease agreement administered by a commercial bank 
the lease  which is accounted for as an operating lease  had an original expiration date in april which was extended to may  in may  the company purchased a portion of the equipment under the old agreement at the residual value of approximately million  and replaced a portion of the existing agreement with a new synthetic lease agreement  which is also accounted for as an operating lease 
the equipment under the new facility had a fair value of approximately million 
the new facility has a term of four years  with expected minimum lease payments of approximately million in   and and million in  all of which is included in the table below in the future minimum synthetic lease payment amounts 
at the end of this new facility  the company has the option of purchasing the equipment at the estimated residual value of approximately million 
the equipment under the new lease had an aggregate residual value of approximately million at december  
table of contents the company s contractual obligations and commercial commitments are summarized in the table below payments due by year contractual obligations total thereafter long term debt obligations operating lease obligations capital lease obligations synthetic lease obligation unconditional purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations the debt payment information presented above assumes that the company s convertible subordinated debentures issued in september will either be redeemed by the company or repurchased by the holders in october  the earliest date upon which redemption or repurchase may occur 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the redemption and repurchase provisions of the debentures 
the operating lease obligations shown in the table have not been reduced by minimum non cancelable sublease rentals aggregating approximately million 
the company remains secondarily liable under these leases in the event that the sublessee defaults under the sublease terms 
the company does not believe that material payments will be required as a result of the secondary liability provisions of the primary lease agreements 
operating lease payments include amounts associated with equipment located at customer sites  with the term of the lease typically tied to the length of the customer contract 
the synthetic lease payments indicated in the table assume that the company would exercise its option to purchase the equipment at the end of the lease for approximately million  which represents the estimated residual value of the equipment at the end of the lease 
unconditional purchase obligations primarily represent commitments for services million and capital expenditures million 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company has long term liabilities for deferred employee compensation  including pension  supplemental retirement plan  and deferred compensation 
the payments related to the supplemental retirement plan and deferred compensation are not included above since they are dependent upon when the employee retires or leaves the company  and whether the employee elects lump sum or annuity payments 
in addition  minimum pension funding requirements are not included above as such amounts are not available for all periods presented 
the company estimates it will contribute approximately million to its pension and supplemental retirement plans in during  the company made approximately million in pension and supplemental retirement plan contributions 
the company has issued standby letters of credit in the ordinary course of business totaling  these letters of credit expire in   and 
the company also has issued guarantees of up to million related to equipment lease agreements between its outsourcing segment and certain equipment vendors  as well as a performance guarantee issued under a client contract  also in the outsourcing segment 
the company does not use derivatives  variable interest entities  or any other form of off balance sheet financing other than the synthetic lease discussed above 

table of contents as of december   the company had a guarantee of up to million canadian dollars related to a credit facility of its canadian subsidiary 
in february  the credit facility was re negotiated and the guarantee was removed 
in its place  the canadian subsidiary used its equipment as collateral 
the company is involved in certain minor joint venture arrangements that are intended to complement the company s core services and markets 
the company has the discretion to provide funding on occasion for working capital or capital expenditures 
the company makes an evaluation of additional funding based on an assessment of the venture s business opportunities 
the company believes that any possible commitments arising from the current arrangements will not be significant to the company s financial condition or results of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company prepares its financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the company s significant accounting polices are disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the selection and application of these accounting principles and methods requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  as well as certain financial statement disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to the recognition of revenue under the percentage of completion method of accounting  allowance for doubtful accounts  valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets  income tax provision and deferred taxes  restructuring costs  actuarial assumptions for employee benefit plans  and contingent liabilities related to litigation and other claims and assessments 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
while management believes that the estimates and assumptions it uses in preparing the financial statements are appropriate  these estimates and assumptions are subject to a number of factors and uncertainties regarding their ultimate outcome  and therefore  actual results could differ from these estimates 
the company has identified its critical accounting policies and estimates below 
these are policies and estimates that the company believes are the most important in portraying the company s financial condition and results  and that require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the company s board of directors 
accounting for goodwill and intangible assets two issues arise with respect to these assets that require significant management estimates and judgment a the valuation in connection with the initial purchase price allocation and b the ongoing evaluation for impairment 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
sfas no 
 business combinations  the company allocates the cost of acquired companies to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired  with the remaining amount being classified as goodwill 
certain intangible assets  such as customer relationships  are amortized to expense over time  while in process research and development costs  if any  are recorded as a one time charge at the acquisition date if it is determined that it has no alternative future use 
the company s future operating performance will be impacted by the future amortization of identifiable intangible assets and potential impairment charges related to goodwill 
accordingly  the allocation of the purchase price to intangible assets and goodwill has a significant impact on the company s future operating results 
the allocation of the purchase price of the acquired companies to intangible assets and goodwill requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions  including estimates of future cash flows expected to be generated by the acquired assets and the appropriate discount rate to value these cash flows 
should different conditions prevail  material write downs of net intangible assets and or goodwill could occur 
the company has acquired certain identifiable intangible assets in connection with its acquisitions of donnelley enterprise solutions inc in  dms and mendez in  and globalnet and decisionquest in 
table of contents these identifiable intangible assets primarily consist of the value associated with customer relationships  trade name  covenants not to compete  software licenses and proprietary technology 
the valuation of these identifiable intangible assets is subjective and requires a great deal of expertise and judgment 
for these reasons  the company has used independent third party valuation firms to value these assets 
the values of the customer relationships were primarily derived using estimates of future cash flows to be generated from the customer relationships 
this approach was used since the inherent value of the customer relationship is its ability to generate current and future income 
the value of the software licenses were derived using the market approach  which is based upon the value of similar or alternative technology 
this approach was used due to the uncertainty regarding the amount of future cash flows to be generated from the software license 
the value of the trade name was determined using an estimated market based royalty rate applied to projected future revenue 
the value of the proprietary technology was based on estimated replacement cost 
the value of the covenant not to compete was determined using a discounted cash flow methodology 
while different amounts would have been reported using different methods or using different assumptions  the company believes that the methods selected and the assumptions used are the most appropriate for each asset analyzed 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standard no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets on january  this standard requires annual impairment testing of goodwill based upon the estimated fair value of the company s reporting units 
we completed our initial transitional test for goodwill impairment as of june   the result of which concluded that the goodwill balance was not impaired 
subsequent valuations performed at december  and december  have also supported the goodwill balance with no impairment 
at december   our goodwill balance was  which primarily related to the globalization segment  and the outsourcing segment 
in testing for potential impairment of goodwill  sfas requires the company to allocate goodwill to the reporting units to which the acquired goodwill relates  estimate the fair value of those reporting units to which goodwill relates  and determine the carrying value book value of those reporting units 
furthermore  if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value for a particular reporting unit  then we are required to estimate the fair value of all identifiable assets and liabilities of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation for an acquired business 
only after this process is completed is the amount of goodwill impairment determined 
accordingly  the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is highly subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis 
for impairment testing purposes  the company has utilized the services of independent consultants to perform valuations of the company s reporting units that contained significant balances of goodwill 
the fair value of the company s reporting units was estimated based on discounted expected future cash flows using a weighted average cost of capital rate 
additionally  an assumed terminal growth rate was used to project future cash flows beyond base years 
the estimates and assumptions regarding expected cash flows  terminal growth rates and the discount rate require considerable judgment and are based upon historical experience  financial forecasts  and industry trends and conditions 
these assumptions are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying business 
based on our estimates  the company has concluded that there is no impairment of goodwill 
however  a decline in expected cash flows or the estimated terminal value could cause reporting units to be valued differently 
if the reporting units do not meet projected operating results  then this analysis could potentially result in a non cash goodwill impairment charge  depending on the estimated value of the company s reporting units 
additionally  an increase in the assumed discount rate weighted average cost of capital could also result in goodwill impairment 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue for substantially all services within its financial print and outsourcing segments when products or services are delivered to customers or when completed 
revenue for services provided within the company s globalization segment are recognized under the percentage of completion method  which relies on estimates of total expected contract revenues and costs 
the company follows this method since reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and costs applicable 
table of contents to various elements of the contract can be made 
since the financial reporting of these contracts depends on estimates  which are assessed continually during the term of these contracts  recognized revenues and profit are subject to revisions as the contract progresses toward completion 
revisions in profit estimates are reflected in the period in which the facts that give rise to the provision become known 
the company believes these revenue recognition methods best represent when the company has earned revenue 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company realizes that it will be unable to collect all amounts that it bills to its customers 
therefore  it estimates the amount of billed receivables that it will be unable to collect and provides an allowance for doubtful accounts during each accounting period 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the realization of these receivables 
the company s estimates are based on  among other things  the aging of its account receivables  its past experience collecting receivables  information about the ability of individual customers to pay  and current economic conditions 
while such estimates have been within our expectations and the provisions established  a change in financial condition of specific customers or in overall trends experienced may result in future adjustments of our estimates of recoverability of our receivables 
as of december   the company had an allowance for doubtful accounts of  accounting for income taxes accounting for taxes requires significant judgments in the development of estimates used in income tax calculations 
such judgments include  but are not limited to  the likelihood the company would realize the benefits of net operating loss carryforwards  the adequacy of valuation allowances  and the rates used to measure transactions with foreign subsidiaries 
as part of the process of preparing the company s financial statements  the company is required to estimate its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which the company operates 
the judgments and estimates used are subject to challenge by domestic and foreign taxing authorities 
it is possible that either domestic or foreign taxing authorities could challenge those judgments and estimates and draw conclusions that would cause the company to incur liabilities in excess of those currently recorded 
the company uses an estimate of its annual effective tax rate at each interim period based upon the facts and circumstances available at that time  while the actual effective tax rate is calculated at year end 
changes in the geographical mix or estimated amount of annual pre tax income could impact the company s overall effective tax rate 
the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
sfas no 
also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
at december  and  the company had deferred tax assets in excess of deferred tax liabilities of  and  respectively 
at december  and  management determined that it is more likely than not that  and  respectively  of such assets will be realized  resulting in a valuation allowance of  and  respectively 
the company evaluates quarterly the realizability of its deferred tax assets by assessing its valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance  if necessary 
the primary factor used to assess the likelihood of realization is the company s forecast of future taxable income 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event the company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should the company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
in management s opinion  adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years presented 
accounting for pensions the company sponsors a defined benefit pension plan in the us the company accounts for its defined benefit pension plan in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  which requires that expenses and liabilities recognized in financial statements be actuarially calculated 
under these accounting standards  assumptions are made regarding the valuation of 
table of contents benefit obligations and the future performance of plan assets 
delayed recognition of differences between actual results and expected or estimated results is a guiding principle of these standards 
this delayed recognition of actual results allows for a smoothed recognition of changes in benefit obligations and plan performance over the working lives of the employees who benefit under the plan 
the primary assumptions used in calculating pension expense and liability are related to the discount rate at which the future obligations are discounted to value the liability  expected rate of return on plan assets  and projected salary increases 
these rates are set annually as of december the discount rate assumption is tied to a long term high quality bond index and is therefore subject to annual fluctuations 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of the pension obligations  which results in higher pension expense 
the discount rate was at december   compared to at december  and at december  the percent at december  was used to calculate the pension expense 
each percentage point change in the discount rate would result in an million change in the projected pension benefit obligation and a million change in pension expense 
the expected rate of return on plan assets assumption is based on the long term expected returns for the investment mix of assets currently in the portfolio 
management uses historic return trends of the asset portfolio combined with anticipated future market conditions to estimate the rate of return 
from to  the company had been using an expected return on plan assets assumption of  which was consistent with the long term asset returns of the portfolio 
in  management lowered the expected rate of return assumption to  and during lowered it again to due to the expected lower future performance of the us equity markets 
each percentage point change in the assumed long term rate of return would result in a million change in pension expense 
the projected salary increase assumption is based upon historical trends and comparisons of the external market 
higher rates of increase result in higher pension expenses 
as this rate is also a long term expected rate  it is less likely to change on an annual basis 
management has used the rate of for the past three years 
restructuring accrual during fiscal and  the company recorded significant restructuring charges representing the direct costs of downsizing our business 
prior to the fourth quarter of  these costs were accrued in accordance with eitf liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
during the fourth quarter of  the company adopted statement of financial accounting standard no 
sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred  whereas under eitf  the liability was recognized at the commitment date to an exit plan 
as a component of the restructuring charge of million  the company recorded an expense related to facility closures and lease termination costs totaling million 
the recorded amount was based on the fair value of contractual obligations contained in the leases net of estimated sublease income discounted using a credit adjusted risk free rate 
this expense was recorded using our estimates of future expected cash flows associated with these office closings 
the liability associated with the facility closures will be adjusted for revisions related to the timing and amount of estimated cash flows in the period they become known 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
sfas  accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred 
when the liability is initially recorded  the entity is required to capitalize the cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
over time  the liability is accreted to its present value each period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  and was adopted by the company effective fiscal the adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on the company s financial statements 

table of contents in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no
