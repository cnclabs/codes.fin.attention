please see selected consolidated financial data for more information regarding our use of adjusted ebitda  arpu and lrs as non gaap financial measures 
our operations are primarily conducted by nextel partners operating corporation opco  a wholly owned subsidiary 
substantially all of our assets  liabilities  operating losses and cash flows are within opco and our other wholly owned subsidiaries 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues total revenues for were approximately  million  an increase of million  or  compared to million generated in the same period in of the million growth in revenues  million was due to the increase in our subscriber base during and our maintenance of an arpu of during  while million of the growth was from recognizing revenue previously deferred in accordance with sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
we expect our revenues to increase as we add more subscribers and continue to introduce new products 
although we anticipate continued growth in our revenues in  we have launched all of our markets and we therefore do not expect to experience revenue and subscriber growth rates of the same magnitude as we have experienced in the past when we were launching new markets on a continuous basis 
our primary sources of revenues are service revenues and equipment revenues 
service revenues increased to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the same period in our service revenues consist of charges to our customers for airtime usage and monthly network access fees from providing integrated wireless services within our territory  specifically digital cellular services  direct connect services  text messaging and nextel online services 
service revenues also include roaming revenues from nextel subscribers using our portion of the nextel digital wireless network 
roaming revenues for accounted for approximately of our service revenues  which was the same percentage as for although we continue to see growth in roaming revenues due to an increase in coverage and on air cell sites  we expect roaming revenues as a percentage of our service revenues to remain flat or decline due to the anticipated revenue growth that we expect to achieve from our own customer base 
for and  our arpu was even with continued competitive pricing pressure  we attribute our ability to maintain arpu at during to the following factors our continued focus on high value customers  the growth in minutes of use during to an average of monthly minutes per subscriber compared to an average of monthly minutes for  increased fees charged to customers during second quarter to recover a portion of the costs associated with government mandated telecommunication services such as enhanced e and number portability  and a strong response to using nationwide direct connect which started in august and was billed either as a monthly rate plan or at a rate of per minute of use 
we expect to continue to achieve arpu levels above the industry average and anticipate our arpu to be in the mid to high s for the following table illustrates service and equipment revenues as a percentage of total revenues for the years ended december  and and our arpu for those periods

we adopted eitf issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  on july  and elected to apply the provisions prospectively to our existing customer arrangements  as described below 
under eitf issue no 
 we are no longer required to consider whether a customer is able to realize utility from the phone in the absence of the undelivered service 
given that we meet the criteria stipulated in eitf issue no 
 we account for the sale of a phone as a unit of accounting separate from the subsequent service to the customer 
accordingly  we recognize revenues from phone equipment sales and the related cost of phone equipment revenues when title to the phone equipment passes to the customer for all arrangements entered into beginning in the third quarter of this results in the classification of amounts received for the sale of the phone equipment  including any activation fees charged to the customer  as equipment revenues at the time of the sale 
for arrangements entered into prior to july   we continue to amortize the revenues and costs previously deferred as was required by sab no 
as amended by sab in december of for a more detailed discussion of this accounting policy  please see critical accounting policies revenue recognition 
the following table shows the reconciliation of the reported service revenues  equipment revenues and cost of equipment revenues to the adjusted amounts that exclude the adoption of eitf no 
and sab no 
we believe the adjusted amounts best represent the actual service revenues and the actual subsidy on equipment costs when equipment revenues are netted with cost of equipment revenues that we use to measure our operating performance

of the million increase from to  million relates to recognizing equipment revenues previously deferred pursuant to sab no 
and recording million as activation fees to equipment revenues based on eitf no 
the remaining million increase in equipment revenues are due to the growth in our subscriber base 
our equipment revenues consist of revenues received for wireless telephones and accessories purchased by our subscribers 
cost of service revenues cost of service revenues consists primarily of network operating costs  which include site rental fees for cell sites and switches  utilities  maintenance and interconnect and other wireline transport charges 
cost of service revenues also includes the amounts we must pay nextel wip when our customers roam onto nextel s portion of the nextel digital wireless network 
these expenses depend mainly on the number of operating cell sites  total minutes of use and the mix of minutes of use between interconnect and direct connect 
the use of direct connect is more efficient than interconnect and  accordingly  less costly for us to provide 
to change year ended december  of service revenues year ended december  of service revenues change change in thousands cost of service revenues    for the year ended december   our cost of service revenues was million as compared to million for the same period in  representing an increase of million  or 
the increase in costs was partially due to adding approximately cell sites during to our wireless network 
furthermore  our number of customers grew compared to  and we experienced an increase in airtime usage by our customers  both of which resulted in higher network operating costs 
compared to  the average monthly minutes of use per subscriber increased by  to average monthly minutes of use per subscriber for from average monthly minutes of use per subscriber for our roaming fees paid to nextel also increased as our growing subscriber base roamed on nextel s compatible network 
in july we acquired from nextel our sixth switch  which is located in texas 
we anticipate that this switch will help reduce the switch sharing costs paid to nextel in since we now expect over of our interconnect traffic will be switched by us 
we expect cost of service revenues to increase as we place more cell sites in service and the usage of minutes increases as our customer base grows 
however  we expect our cost of service revenues as a percentage of service revenues and cost per average minute of use to decrease as economies of scale continue to be realized 
cost of equipment revenues to change year ended december  of service revenues year ended december  of service revenues change change in thousands cost of equipment revenues    cost of equipment revenues includes the cost of the subscriber wireless telephones and accessories sold by us 
our cost of equipment revenues for the year ended december  was million as compared to million for the same period in  or an increase of million 
the increase in costs relates mostly to recognizing million of equipment costs that was previously deferred in accordance with sab no 
and million due to the increased volume of subscribers 
the table below reflects the cost of equipment revenues taking into account the effect of eliminating sab no 
for the year ended december  in thousands cost of equipment revenues as reported   cost of equipment revenues deferred sab no 
  previously deferred cost of equipment revenues recognized sab no 
total cost of equipment revenues without sab no 
  due to the push to talk functionality of our handsets  the cost of our equipment tends to be higher than that of our competitors 
as part of our business plan  we often offer our equipment at a discount or as part of a promotion as an incentive to our customers to commit to contracts for our higher priced service plans and to compete with the lower priced competitor handsets 
the table below shows that the gross subsidy without the effects of sab no 
and eitf no 
between equipment revenues and cost of equipment revenues was a loss of million for  as compared to a loss of million for the same period in we expect to continue to employ these discounts and promotions in an effort to grow our subscriber base 
therefore  for the foreseeable future  we expect that cost of equipment revenues will continue to exceed our equipment revenues 
for the year ended december  in thousands equipment revenues billed   cost of equipment revenues billed   total gross subsidy for equipment   selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses consist of sales and marketing expenses  expenses related to customer care services and general and administrative costs 
for the year ended december   selling  general and administrative expenses were million compared to million for the same period in  representing an increase of 
to change year ended december  of service revenues year ended december  of service revenues change change in thousands selling  general and administrative expenses   sales and marketing expenses increased million from to  or  of which million was due to higher commissions and residuals earned by our indirect dealers as a result of increased new subscriber activations from this channel 
indirect dealers earn commissions for activation of handsets for new subscribers 
in addition  we pay some indirect dealers residuals to encourage ongoing customer support and to promote sales to high value customers who are more likely to generate higher monthly service revenues and less likely to deactivate service 
the remaining net increase in sales and marketing expenses of million was due to start up and operating costs for the new retail stores put in operation during as of december  we had retail stores in operation and we expect to open approximately additional stores in  which will result in additional start up and operating costs 
general and administrative costs include costs associated with customer care center operations  service and repair for customer phones along with corporate personnel including billing  collections  legal  finance  human resources and information technology 
the increase in general and administrative costs compared to reflects a million increase due to hiring additional staff and operating expenses to support our growing customer base and related customer care activities in las vegas  nevada and panama city beach  florida  a million increase in billing  bad debt  collection and customer retention expenses to support a larger and growing customer base  and a million increase in personnel  support of our information systems and corporate expenses 
as we continue to grow our customer base and expand our operations  we expect our sales and marketing expenses and general and administrative costs to continue to increase  but at a slower rate than our customer growth due to efficiencies we anticipate being able to implement 
stock based compensation expense for the years ended december  and  we recorded non cash  stock based compensation expense associated with our grants of restricted stock and employee stock options of approximately million and million  respectively 
subject to our mandatory adoption of any future accounting pronouncements  we expect stock based compensation expense to continue to decrease as the options and restricted stock continue to vest

for our depreciation and amortization expense was million compared to million for the same period in  representing an increase of 
the million increase in depreciation expense was due to adding approximately cell sites along with the acquisition of a new switch in texas in july  as well as costs to modify existing switches and cell sites 
we also acquired furniture and equipment for our offices and new retail stores 
we expect depreciation to continue to increase due to additional cell sites we plan to place in service

interest expense  net of capitalized interest  declined million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this decline was due mostly to the debt reduction activity related to our repurchase for cash of our senior discount notes  senior notes  senior notes and our series b mandatorily redeemable preferred stock 
in addition  for our interest rate swap agreements we recorded a non cash fair market value gain of approximately million for compared to a charge of approximately million non cash fair market value loss for the same period in for  interest income was million compared to million for this decrease was due mostly to a decline in interest rates on our short term investments 
loss on early retirement of debt during we recorded a million loss on early retirement of debt related to our repurchase for cash of million principal amount at maturity of our senior discount notes  million principal amount at maturity of our senior notes  million principal amount at maturity of our senior notes  and million of our series b mandatorily redeemable preferred stock 
we also refinanced our million credit facility and exchanged million of our senior discount notes for shares of our class a common stock 
of the million loss  million represented a premium paid to repurchase or exchange the notes and million related to the write off of the deferred financing costs for the debt reduction activities 
deferred income tax provision as a result of adopting sfas no 
 we are now required to record a non cash income tax provision 
this charge is required because we have significant deferred tax liabilities related to fcc licenses with a lower tax than book basis as a result of accelerated and continued amortization of fcc licenses for tax purposes 
historically  we did not need a valuation allowance for the portion of our net operating loss equal to the amount of license amortization expected to occur during the carry forward period of our net operating loss 
since we ceased amortizing licenses for financial statement purposes on january   we can no longer estimate the amount  if any  of deferred tax liabilities related to our fcc licenses which will reverse during the net operating loss carry forward period 
accordingly  we increased the valuation allowance upon the adoption of sfas no 
to million and continue to increase the valuation allowance as the deferred tax liabilities related to fcc licenses increase 
during and  we recorded a deferred income tax provision of million and million  respectively  relating to our fcc licenses 
net loss attributable to common stockholders for  we had a net loss attributable to common stockholders of approximately million compared to a net loss attributable to common stockholders of million for the same period in  representing an improvement of million  or 
the million net loss included a million loss for early retirement of debt that pertains to an aggregate of debt reduction and refinancing transactions totaling billion principal amount at maturity 
during  we expect to continue to decrease our net loss and work towards generating positive net income for year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues total revenues increased to million for the year ended december  as compared to million generated in the same period in this growth in revenues was due to the increase in our subscriber base from our existing markets since we did not launch any new markets in service revenues increased to million for the year ended december  as compared to million recognized during roaming revenues for accounted for approximately of our service revenues  as compared to in the following table shows the impact of our accounting policy whereby we defer activation fees and equipment revenue and related costs over a three year period for the years ended december  and for a discussion of this accounting policy  please see critical accounting policies revenue recognition

the increase in costs was primarily the result of bringing on air approximately additional cell sites since december   as well as an increase in airtime usage  both of which resulted in higher network operating costs 
increased airtime usage resulted both from the growth in the number of customers from as well as from the increased average minutes of use per customer

interest expense and interest income interest expense  net of capitalized interest  increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   representing an increase of

net cash from investing activities for was million compared to million for the same period in the million increase in net cash from investing activities was primarily due to a million decrease in net cash proceeds from the sale and maturities of short term investments  offset by a million decrease in capital expenditures  and a million decrease in fcc licenses acquired 
our total capital spending for was approximately million  which was an approximately million decrease from our initial forecast of million given at the beginning of  and approximately million lower than our capital spending for our reduced spending for was primarily the result of capacity gains from new technology deployment and reduction in cell site costs compared to budget 
net cash provided from financing activities for totaled million  which was an increase of million compared to million provided in the same period in as discussed above  we completed a series of capital structure transactions during  which helped to provide funds from financing activities and improved our overall liquidity position 
the million increase in net cash provided from financing activities was primarily due to the following our receipt of an additional  million proceeds from the sale of convertible senior notes and senior notes and refinancing our credit facility as described above  our receipt of million from our equity offering in november  and our receipt of an additional million from stock options exercised  offset by our use of  million for the refinance of our credit facility and the repurchase and retirement of an aggregate of million principal amount at maturity of our senior discount notes  senior notes  senior notes and series b mandatorily redeemable preferred stock  our use of an additional million for debt and equity issuance costs related to the above noted capital structure transactions and the refinancing of our credit facility  and a million decrease in proceeds received in compared to from the sale of the kentucky and florida switches and simultaneous capital leaseback transactions 
capital needs and funding sources our primary liquidity needs arise from the capital requirements necessary to expand and enhance coverage in our existing markets that are part of the nextel digital wireless network 
other liquidity needs include the future acquisition of additional frequencies  the installation of new or additional switch equipment  the introduction of new technology and services  and debt service requirements related to our long term debt and capital leases 
without limiting the foregoing  we expect capital expenditures to include  among other things  the purchase of switches  base radios  transmission towers and antennae  radio frequency engineering  cell site construction  and information technology software and equipment 
based on our ten year operating and capital plan  we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments and access to our line of credit  as necessary  will provide sufficient funds for the foreseeable future to finance our capital needs and working capital requirements as well as provide the necessary funds to acquire any additional fcc licenses 
to the extent we are not able to generate positive cash from operating activities  we will be required to use more of our available liquidity to fund operations or we would require additional financing 
we may be unable to raise additional capital on acceptable terms  if at all 
furthermore  our ability to generate positive cash from operating activities is dependent upon the amount of revenue we receive from customers  operating expenses required to provide our service  the cost of acquiring and retaining customers and our ability to continue to grow our customer base 
additionally  to the extent we decide to expand our digital wireless network or deploy next generation technologies  we may require additional financing to fund these projects 
in the event that additional financing is necessary  such financing may not be available to us on satisfactory terms  if at all  for a number of reasons  including  without limitation  restrictions in our debt instruments on our ability to raise additional funds  conditions in the economy generally and in the wireless communications industry specifically  and other factors that may be beyond our control 
to the extent that additional capital is raised through the sale of equity or securities convertible into equity  the issuance of such securities could result in dilution of our stockholders

we anticipate that this redemption will be complete in march  but it is not reflected in the above table 
included in the purchase obligations caption above are minimum amounts due under our most significant agreements for telecommunication services required for back office support 
amounts actually paid under some of these agreements may be higher due to variable components of these agreements 
in addition to the amounts reflected in the table  we expect to pay significant amounts to motorola for infrastructure  handsets and related services in future years

recent developments on february   we gave notice of our intention to redeem all of our senior discount notes that remained outstanding approximately million principal amount at maturity for a total redemption price of approximately million 
we anticipate that this redemption will be complete in march critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the sec has defined a company s most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations  and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
based on this definition  we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below 
we also have other key accounting policies  which involve the use of estimates  judgments and assumptions 
for additional information see the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
although we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable  they are based upon information presently available 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition we recognize service revenues for access charges and other services charged at fixed amounts ratably over the service period  net of credits and adjustments for service discounts 
these discounts typically relate to promotional service campaigns in which customers will receive a monthly discount on their service plan for a limited period depending on the features of the rate plan 
additionally  for situations where customers may have a billing dispute  coverage dispute or service issue  we may grant a one time credit or adjustment to the customer s bill 
we recognize excess usage and long distance revenue at contractual rates per minute as minutes are used 
to account for the service revenues  including adjustments and discounts  that are unbilled at month end  we make an estimate of unbilled service revenues from the end of the billed service period to the end of the month 
this estimate  which is subjective  is based on a number of factors  including the increase in net subscribers  number of business days from the billed service period to the end of the month and the average revenue per subscriber  after taking partial billing periods into consideration 
this estimate is accrued monthly and reversed the following month when the actual service period is billed again 
the actual service revenues could be greater or lower than the amounts estimated due to rate plans in effect and the minutes of use differing from the factors used for the estimate 
historically  our differences between the estimated and actual service revenues have not been material 
equipment revenues include sale of phone and accessory equipment 
we recognize revenues for phone and accessory equipment when title passes to the customer  which is upon shipping the item to the customer 
in november  the eitf issued a final consensus on issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
issue no 
provides guidance on how and when to recognize revenues on arrangements requiring delivery of more than one product or service 
we adopted eitf issue no 
on july  and elected to apply the provisions prospectively to our existing customer arrangements  as described below 
prior to the adoption of eitf no  we followed the guidance of sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  and accounted for the sale of our phone equipment and the subsequent service to the customer as a single unit of accounting as our wireless service is essential to the functionality of our phones 
accordingly  we recognized revenues from the phone equipment sales and an equal amount of the cost of phone equipment revenues over the expected customer relationship period when title to the phone passed to the customer 
under eitf issue no 
 we are no longer required to consider whether a customer is able to realize utility from the phone in the absence of the undelivered service 
given that we meet the criteria stipulated in eitf issue no 
 we account for the sale of a phone as a unit of accounting separate from the subsequent service to the customer 
accordingly  we recognize revenues from phone equipment sales and the related cost of phone equipment revenues when title to the phone equipment passes to the customer for all arrangements entered into beginning in the third quarter of this resulted in the classification of amounts received for the sale of the phone equipment  including any activation fees charged to the customer  as equipment revenues at the time of the sale 
for arrangements entered into prior to july   we continue to amortize the revenues and costs previously deferred as was required by sab no 
in december of  the sec staff issued sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements which updated sab no 
to reflect the impact of the issuance of eitf no 
accounts receivable accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and include late payment fee charges for unpaid balances 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses that will occur in our existing accounts receivable balance 
we review our allowance for doubtful accounts monthly 
we determine the allowance based on the age of the balances and our experience of collecting on certain account types such as corporate  small business  government or other various classifications 
account balances are charged off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted internally and the potential for recovery is considered remote or delegated to a third party collection agency 
changes to our allowance may be required if we have to alter our write off patterns due to the financial condition of our customers or if we adjust our credit standards for new customers 
historically  we have not had to make material adjustments 
capitalization and depreciation of fixed assets our business is inherently capital intensive due to the build out and continual expansion of our digital network 
thus  we record our system digital network and non system fixed assets  including improvements that extend useful lives  at cost  while maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred 
depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight line method with estimated useful lives of up to years for cell site shelters  three to ten years for digital mobile network equipment  and three to seven years for furniture and fixtures 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the respective lives of the leases or the useful lives of the improvements 
as we continue to track the utilization of our system and non system fixed assets  we may find that the actual economic lives may be different than our estimated useful lives  thus resulting in different carrying values of our fixed assets or property  plant and equipment 
this could also result in a change of our depreciation expense in future periods 
to date  we have not changed the estimated useful lives that we employ  but we will continue to conduct periodic evaluations to confirm that they are appropriate  taking into consideration such factors as changes in our technology and the industry 
construction in progress includes costs of labor internal and external  materials  transmission and related equipment  engineering  site design  interest and other costs relating to the construction and development of our digital mobile network 
assets under construction are not depreciated until placed into service 
in capitalizing costs related to the construction of our digital network  we include costs that are required to activate the network 
fcc licenses fcc operating licenses are recorded at historical cost 
our fcc licenses and the requirements to maintain the licenses are similar to other licenses granted by the fcc  including pcs and cellular licenses  in that they are subject to renewal after the initial year term 
historically  the renewal process associated with these fcc licenses has been perfunctory 
the accounting for these licenses has historically not been constrained by the renewal and operational requirements 
on january   we implemented sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires the use of a non amortization approach to account for purchased goodwill and certain intangibles 
under a non amortization approach  goodwill and certain intangibles are not amortized into results of operations  but instead are reviewed for impairment  at least annually  and written down as a charge to results of operations only in the periods in which the recorded value of goodwill and certain intangibles exceeds fair value 
we have determined that fcc licenses have indefinite lives  therefore  as of january  we no longer amortize the cost of these licenses 
we performed an initial and annual asset impairment analyses on our fcc licenses in accordance with sfas no 
and determined that there has been no impairment as the fair values of the licenses were greater than their carrying values 
for our impairment analysis  we use the aggregate of all of our fcc licenses  which constitutes the footprint of our portion of the nextel digital wireless network  as the unit of accounting for our fcc licenses based on the guidance in eitf issue no 
 unit of accounting for testing impairment indefinite lived intangible assets  to estimate the fair value of our licenses using a discounted cash flow model 
the estimates that we use in the cash flow model were based on our long range cash flow projections  discounted at our corporate weighted average cost of capital 
the use of different estimates or assumptions within our discounted cash flow model when determining the fair value of our licensing cost may result in different values for our licensing costs and any related impairment charge 
as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
 we recorded a non cash charge to our income tax provision of million at the end of the first quarter of to increase the valuation allowance related to our net operating loss 
this charge was required because we had significant deferred tax liabilities related to fcc licenses 
historically  we did not need a valuation allowance for the portion of our net operating loss equal to the amount of license amortization expected to occur during the carry forward period of our net operating loss 
since we ceased amortizing licenses for financial statement purposes on january   we can no longer estimate the amount  if any  of deferred tax liabilities related to our fcc licenses which will reverse during the net operating loss carry forward period 
accordingly  we increased the valuation allowance upon the adoption of sfas no 
and continue to increase the valuation allowance with a corresponding deferred tax provision as the deferred tax liabilities related to fcc license amortization increase 
for and  the deferred tax provision attributable to fcc licenses was million and million  respectively 
impairment of long lived assets our long lived assets consist principally of property  plant and equipment 
it is our policy to assess impairment of long lived assets pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this includes determining if certain triggering events have occurred  including significant decreases in the market value of certain assets  significant changes in the manner in which an asset is used  significant changes in the legal climate or business climate that could affect the value of an asset  or current period or continuing operating or cash flow losses or projections that demonstrate continuing losses associated with certain assets used for the purpose of producing revenue that might be an indicator of impairment 
when we perform the sfas no 
impairment tests  we identify the appropriate asset group to be our network system  which includes the grouping of all of our assets required to operate our portion of the nextel digital wireless network and provide service to our customers 
we based this conclusion of asset grouping on the revenue dependency  operating interdependency and shared costs to operate our network 
thus far  we believe none of the above factors has occurred and therefore have not recorded any impairment charges 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
revised december  consolidation of variable interest entities fin r  which addresses how a business enterprise should evaluate whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity through means other than voting rights and accordingly should consolidate the entity 
fin r replaces fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  which was issued in january we are required to apply fin r to variable interest in variable interest entities vies created after december  for variable interests in vies created before january   the interpretation will be applied beginning on january  for any vies that must be consolidated under fin r that were created before january   the assets  liabilities and noncontrolling interests of the vie initially would be measured at their carrying amounts with any difference between the net amount added to the balance sheet and any previously recognized interest being recognized as the cumulative effect of an accounting change 
if determining the carrying amounts is not practicable  fair value at the date fin r first applies may be used to measure the assets  liabilities and non controlling interest of the vie 
the application of this interpretation is not expected to have a material effect on our financial statements  as we do not believe that we have any existing vies that require consolidation 
related party transactions motorola purchase agreements pursuant to the equipment purchase agreements between us and motorola  who held approximately  of our outstanding common stock as of december   motorola provides the iden infrastructure and subscriber handset equipment to us throughout our markets

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to market risks arising from changes in interest rates 
our primary interest rate risk results from changes in libor or the prime rate  which are used to determine the interest rate applicable to the term loan of opco under our credit facility

in april and  we entered into interest rate swap agreements for million and million respectively  to partially manage interest rate exposure with respect to our previous million term b and c loans 
in december we refinanced our term b and c loans and replaced them with a million tranche b credit facility  but maintained our existing rate swap agreements 
interest rate swaps have the effect of converting the applicable variable rate obligations to fixed or other variable rate obligations 
we have elected to not designate these interest rate swaps as hedges under sfas the interest rate swap agreements are included in other long term liabilities on the balance sheet 
for the year ended december   we recorded a non cash  fair market value gain of approximately million related to the market value of interest rate swap agreements which has been reflected in interest expense

we do not intend to use financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes  nor do we intend to be a party to any leveraged derivative instrument 
the use of derivative financial instruments is monitored through regular communication with senior management

this credit risk is minimized by dealing with a group of major financial institutions with whom we have other financial relationships 
we do not anticipate nonperformance by these counter parties
