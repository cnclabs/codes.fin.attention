item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview wabtec is one of the world s largest providers of value added  technology based products and services for the global rail industry 
our products are found on virtually all locomotives  freight cars and passenger transit vehicles in the us  as well as in certain markets throughout the world 
our products enhance safety  improve productivity and reduce maintenance costs for customers  and many of our core products and services are essential in the safe and efficient operation of freight rail and passenger transit vehicles 
wabtec is a global company with operations in nine countries 
in  about percent of the company s revenues came from its north american operations  but wabtec also sold products or services in countries around the world 
management review of and future outlook wabtec s long term financial goals are to generate free cash flow in excess of net income  maintain a strong credit profile while minimizing our overall cost of capital  increase margins through strict attention to cost controls  and increase revenues through a focused growth strategy 
in addition  management monitors the company s short term operational performance through measures such as quality and on time delivery 
in  we achieved the following generated cash of million  more than double net income of million  debt net of cash  was million at dec 
  compared to million at the end of  gross margin increased to compared to for  as a favorable product mix and cost reductions more than offset the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates  revenues increased  as higher sales of freight car original equipment in north america and higher international sales combined to offset lower sales of aftermarket components and transit original equipment  product quality  as measured by first time pass rate  improved by  on time delivery increased 
we achieved these results despite continued weakness in demand for aftermarket products and services  and a drop in sales in the transit group  which completed several major contracts in in addition  foreign currency exchange rates had a negative impact on the company s canadian operations 
we expect increased demand for our products as the us economy recovers  government transit spending increases and class i railroads  utilities and leasing companies begin to reinvest in their fleets after deferring capital spending during the difficult us economic environment since we anticipate that this increased capital spending will positively impact rail industry fundamentals  which have shown gradual improvement over the past few quarters  as evidenced by better than expected freight car orders and backlog 
for example  freight car deliveries increased to  in the fourth quarter of  an increase of over the prior quarter and up over the prior year 
the table below demonstrates the improving trends in the freight car segment of the rail industry orders deliveries backlog first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter source railway supply institute freight car  locomotive and transit car deliveries for the industry are expected to trend upwards providing an expanding market for the company actual forecast freight car transit locomotive based on company estimates in  we expect demand to improve in two of our key markets components for new freight cars and new locomotives  but we do not expect growth in the aftermarket  which represents about of sales 

table of contents looking beyond  we expect to generate increases in sales and earnings from executing our four point growth strategy see page for more details expand sales of systems offerings as tier supplier  accelerate new product and service development  expand globally  continuous improvement through lean principles 
in and beyond  we will continue to face many challenges  including increased costs for raw materials  especially steel  higher costs for medical and insurance premiums  and foreign currency fluctuations 
in addition  we face general economic risks  as well as the risk that our customers could curtail spending on new and existing equipment 
risks associated with our four point growth strategy include the level of investment that customers are willing to make in new technologies developed by the industry and the company  and risks inherent in global expansion 
when necessary  we will modify our financial and operating strategies to reflect changes in market conditions and risks

net sales for increased million  or  as compared to the increased sales in the freight group more than offset lower sales in the transit group 
the freight group s increased sales reflected higher sales of components for new freight cars and locomotives  and commuter locomotives  as well as higher international sales 
industry deliveries of new freight cars for increased to about  units as compared to about  in the transit group s decreased sales were due to the completion of a contract to supply components for new york city subway cars in and lower aftermarket sales 
gross profit 
gross profit increased to million in compared to million in gross profit is dependent on a number of factors including pricing  sales volume and product mix 
gross profit  as a percentage of sales  was compared to in the increase in gross profit percentage is primarily due to higher sales and favorable product mix  which more than offset the negative impact of the weakening us dollar versus the canadian dollar 
the following table shows our operating expenses for the year ended december  in thousands percent change selling  general and administrative expenses engineering expenses amortization expense total operating expenses operating expenses 
operating expenses increased million in as compared to due to the write off of non operating assets of million  and higher medical and insurance premiums  partially offset by reduced amortization expense

goodwill and other intangible assets 
the total impact of the writedown  net of tax was million 
in july  we redeemed at par face million of the senior notes due in through the use of cash on hand and additional borrowings under the credit agreement 
this redemption resulted in a non cash loss of million  relating to a write off of deferred debt issuance costs  which was recorded as interest expense 
in november  we sold certain assets to ge transportation systems for million in cash 
the assets sold primarily included locomotive aftermarket products and services for which we were not the oem 
the sale resulted in an after tax gain of million  which is reflected on the income statement as a gain  net of tax  on the sale of discontinued operations 
in the fourth quarter of  we decided to exit certain businesses 
the net amount of these businesses was written down to their estimated realizable value 
this resulted in a pre tax charge of million and an after tax charge of million 
merger and restructuring plan 
in  the company completed a merger and restructuring plan with costs totaling million pre tax  with approximately million of the charge expensed in  million in and million in the plan involved the elimination of duplicate facilities and excess capacity  operational realignment and related workforce reductions  and the evaluation of certain assets as to their perceived ongoing benefit to the company 
the following table shows the company s net sales by business segment for the year ended december  in thousands freight group transit group net sales net sales 
net sales for decreased million or to million as compared to the prior period 
both the freight group and transit group had lower sales 
the freight group s decreased sales reflected lower sales of components for new freight cars and locomotives 
in  industry deliveries of new freight cars decreased to  units as compared to  in the same period in in  industry deliveries of new locomotives decreased to as compared to  in the same period in the transit group s decreased sales were primarily due to the completion of a supply contract for new york city subway cars in the third quarter of gross profit 
gross profit decreased to million or of sales in compared to million or of sales in the same period of the decrease in gross profit and margin is largely attributed to the effect of a decrease in sales volumes  which had a negative impact of about million

operating expenses improved by million in as compared to included in operating expenses for were goodwill amortization of million  million for asset writedowns  million for merger and restructuring charges and million for severance costs in the remaining decrease in operating expenses was due to a decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses 

table of contents income from operations 
income from operations totaled million in compared with million in operating income would have been million in excluding the adjustments discussed in the prior paragraph 
lower operating income resulted from decreased sales volumes in see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in part iv  item of this report

net income decreased million  or  compared with the same period the prior year 
however  adjusting for the gain on sale of certain businesses of million  and the goodwill writedown of million net of tax  net income declined million  principally the result of overall lower sales activity in compared to income taxes in the next three years cash outlays for income taxes will be less then income tax expense due to the amortization of goodwill and intangible assets which will continue to be amortized for tax purposes 
the company s current level of pre tax income is sufficient to utilize the deferred tax assets 
as of the company has utilized all previous federal net operating losses  and a portion of the reported federal credits in the amount of million will be realized through a carry back regardless of current income generated 
the company engages in diverse foreign activity whereby certain funds could be repatriated to the us this would afford the company the opportunity to utilize certain assets more quickly 
management believes tax planning opportunities exist in various foreign countries that will allow the company to utilize foreign net operating loss carryforwards 
any tax assets that are uncertain regarding realization have a valuation allowance in the full amount of the asset 
management believes the remaining assets will be realized in the normal course of business

although ebitda is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  management believes that it is useful to an investor in evaluating wabtec because it is widely used as a measure to evaluate a company s operating performance and ability to service debt 
financial covenants in our credit facility include ratios based on ebitda 
ebitda does not purport to represent cash generated by operating activities and should not be considered in isolation or as substitute for measures of performance in accordance with

the million facility provided a reduced five year facility of million and a reduced day facility of million 
in november we allowed the million day facility to expire 
at december   we had available bank borrowing capacity  net of million of letters of credit  of approximately million 
under the credit agreement  we may elect a base rate  an interest rate based on the london interbank offered rates of interest libor  a cost of funds rate and a bid rate 
the base rate is the greater of lasalle bank national association s prime rate or the federal funds effective rate plus per annum 
the libor rate is based on libor plus a margin that ranges from to basis points depending on our consolidated total indebtedness to cash flow ratios

the cost of funds rate is a fluctuating interest rate based on lasalle bank national association s then cost of funds 
under the bid rate option  any participating bank may propose the interest rate at which it will lend funds  which rate may either be a fixed rate or a floating rate based on libor

the maximum credit agreement borrowings  average credit agreement borrowings and weighted average contractual interest rate on credit agreement borrowings were million  million and  respectively for to reduce the impact of interest rate changes on a portion of this variable rate debt  we entered into interest rate swaps which effectively convert a portion of the debt from variable to fixed rate borrowings during the term of the swap contracts 
on december   the notional value of interest rate swaps outstanding totaled million and effectively changed our interest rate from a variable rate to a fixed rate of 
the interest rate swap agreements mature in february we are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties 
however  since only the cash interest payments are exchanged  exposure is significantly less than the notional amount 
the counterparties are large financial institutions and we do not anticipate nonperformance 
in january  we refinanced the credit agreement with a consortium of commercial banks 
this refinancing credit agreement currently provides a million five year revolving credit facility expiring in january under the refinancing credit agreement  we may elect a base rate or an interest rate based on the london interbank offered rates of interest libor

the company is in compliance with these measurements and covenants and expects that these measurements will not be any type of limiting factor in executing our operating activities 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in part iv  item of this report 
we believe  based on current levels of operations and forecasted earnings  cash flow and liquidity will be sufficient to fund our working capital and capital equipment needs as well as meeting the debt service requirements 
if our sources of funds were to fail to satisfy our cash requirements  we may need to refinance our existing debt or obtain additional financing 
there is no assurance that such new financing alternatives would be

extinguishment of other debt 
in june  the company issued million of senior notes due in the notes 
in january  the company issued an additional million of senior notes due in the notes 
the notes and the notes were redeemed at par face on july  through the use of cash on hand and additional borrowings under the credit agreement 
this redemption resulted in a non cash loss of million relating to a write off of deferred debt issuance costs 
in july  a subsidiary of the company entered into a year million debt obligation for the purchase of a building used in the company s operations 
the debt was repaid in september effects of inflation general price inflation has not had a material impact on the company s results of operations 
some of our labor contracts contain negotiated salary and benefit increases and others contain cost of living adjustment clauses  which would cause our labor cost to automatically increase if inflation were to become significant 

table of contents contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements we are obligated to make future payments under various contracts such as debt agreements  lease agreements and have certain contingent commitments such as debt guarantees 
we have grouped these contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements into operating activities  financing activities  and investing activities in the same manner as they are classified in the statement of consolidated cash flows to provide a better understanding of the nature of the obligations and arrangements and to provide a basis for comparison to historical information

forward looking statements we believe that all statements other than statements of historical facts included in this report  including certain statements under business and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  may constitute forward looking statements 
we have based these forward looking statements on our current expectations and projections about future events 
although we believe that our assumptions made in connection with the forward looking statements are reasonable  we cannot assure you that our assumptions and expectations are correct 
these forward looking statements are subject to various risks  uncertainties and assumptions about us  including  among other things economic and industry conditions materially adverse changes in economic or industry conditions generally or in the markets served by us  including north america  south america  europe  australia and asia  demand for freight cars  locomotives  passenger transit cars  buses and related products and services  reliance on major original equipment manufacturer customers  original equipment manufacturers program delays  demand for services in the freight and passenger rail industry  demand for our products and services  recovery in our industry  and in particular  orders either being delayed  cancelled  not returning to historical levels  or reduced or any combination of the foregoing  consolidations in the rail industry  continued outsourcing by our customers  industry demand for faster and more efficient braking equipment  or fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  operating factors supply disruptions  technical difficulties  changes in operating conditions and costs  successful introduction of new products  labor relations  completion and integration of acquisitions  or the development and use of new technology  competitive factors the actions of competitors  political governmental factors political stability in relevant areas of the world  future regulation deregulation of our customers and or the rail industry  levels of governmental funding on transit projects  including for some of our customers  political developments and laws and regulations  or the outcome of our existing or any future legal proceedings  including litigation involving our principal customers and any litigation with respect to environmental  asbestos related matters and pension liabilities  and transaction or commercial factors the outcome of negotiations with partners  governments  suppliers  customers or others

critical accounting policies the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make judgments  estimates and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
areas of uncertainty that require judgments  estimates and assumptions include the accounting for derivatives  environmental matters  warranty reserves  the testing of goodwill and other intangibles for impairment  proceeds on assets to be sold  pensions and other postretirement benefits  and tax matters 
management uses historical experience and all available information to make these judgments and estimates  and actual results will inevitably differ from those estimates and assumptions that are used to prepare the company s financial statements at any given time 
despite these inherent limitations  management believes that management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a and the financial statements and related footnotes provide a meaningful and fair perspective of the company 
a discussion of the judgments and uncertainties associated with accounting for derivatives and environmental matters can be found in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part iv  item of this report 
a summary of the company s significant accounting policies is included in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part iv  item of this report 
management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables the company to provide the users of the financial statements with useful and reliable information about the company s operating results and financial condition 

table of contents in  we adopted the new standard of accounting for goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives 
the cumulative effect adjustment recognized on january   upon adoption of the new standard  was a charge of million after tax 
also in  amortization ceased for goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives 
total amortization expense for intangible assets recognized was million in and million in additionally  goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles are required to be tested for impairment at least annually 
the evaluation of impairment involves comparing the current fair value of the business to the recorded value including goodwill 
we use a combination of a guideline public company market approach and a discounted cash flow model dcf model to determine the current fair value of the business 
a number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the dcf model to forecasted operating cash flows  including markets and market share  sales volume and pricing  costs to produce and working capital changes 
management considers historical experience and all available information at the time the fair values of its business are estimated 
however  actual fair values that could be realized in an actual transaction may differ from those used to evaluate the impairment of goodwill 
the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in our receivable portfolio determined on the basis of historical experience  specific allowances for known troubled accounts and other currently available evidence 
other areas of significant judgments and estimates include the liabilities and expenses for pensions and other postretirement benefits 
these amounts are determined using actuarial methodologies and incorporate significant assumptions  including the rate used to discount the future estimated liability  the long term rate of return on plan assets and several assumptions relating to the employee workforce salary increases  medical costs  retirement age and mortality 
the rate used to discount future estimated liabilities is determined considering the rates available at year end on debt instruments that could be used to settle the obligations of the plan 
the long term rate of return is estimated by considering historical returns and expected returns on current and projected asset allocations and is generally applied to a five year average market value of assets 
as a global company  wabtec records an estimated liability or benefit for income and other taxes based on what it determines will likely be paid in various tax jurisdictions in which it operates 
management uses its best judgment in the determination of these amounts 
however  the liabilities ultimately realized and paid are dependent on various matters including the resolution of the tax audits in the various affected tax jurisdictions and may differ from the amounts recorded 
an adjustment to the estimated liability would be recorded through income in the period in which it becomes probable that the amount of the actual liability differs from the recorded amount 
management does not believe that such a charge would be material 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk in the ordinary course of business  we are exposed to risks that increases in interest rates may adversely affect funding costs associated with its variable rate debt 
after considering the effects of interest rate swaps  further described below  our variable rate debt represents of total long term debt at december  and in management has entered into pay fixed  receive variable interest rate swap contracts that mitigates the impact of variable rate debt interest rate increases 
at december   an instantaneous basis point increase in interest rates would not reduce our annual earnings 
we have adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 and as amended by sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities effective january  in the application  we have concluded that our swap contracts qualify for special cash flow hedge accounting which permit recording the fair value of the swap and corresponding adjustment to other comprehensive income on the balance sheet see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in part iv  item of this report 
this fluctuation is not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
foreign currency exchange risk we occasionally enter into several types of financial instruments for the purpose of managing our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in countries in which we have significant operations 
as of december   we had several such instruments outstanding to hedge currency rate fluctuation in we entered into foreign currency options and forward contracts to reduce the impact of changes in currency exchange rates 
a currency option gives us the right but not the obligation to exchange currency at a pre determined exchange rate either on a specific date or within a specific period of time 
forward contracts are agreements with a counterparty to exchange two distinct currencies at a set exchange rate for delivery on a set date at some point in the future 
there is no exchange of funds until the delivery date 
at the delivery date we can either take delivery of the currency or settle on a net basis 
all outstanding forward contracts and option agreements are for the sale of us dollars usd and the purchase of canadian dollars cad 
as of december   we had outstanding option agreements with a notional value of million cad resulting in the recording of a current asset of  and an increase in comprehensive income of  net of tax and has forward contracts with a notional value of million cad  resulting in the 
table of contents recording of a current asset of  and an increase in comprehensive income of  net of tax 
subsequent to december   the company entered into additional forward contracts to hedge its exposure to canadian currency risk
