item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview biosource develops  manufactures  markets and distributes products and services that are widely used in biomedical research 
its products and services enable scientists to better understand the biochemistry  immunology and cell biology of the human body  aging and certain diseases such as cancer  arthritis and other inflammatory diseases  aids and certain other infectious diseases 
the company has a wide variety of products  including immunoassay and elisa test kits  immunological reagents  including bioactive proteins cytokines  growth factors and adhesion molecules  oligonucleotides  and monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies 
the company also manufactures and markets custom oligonucleotides  peptides and antibodies to the specifications of its customers 
it uses recombinant dna technology to produce cytokines and other proteins and has registered its analyte specific reagents with the fda for which it has received a license to sell such products as class i medical devices 
the company markets these products to in vitro diagnostic manufacturers and clinical reference laboratories as active ingredients in the tests those parties produce to identify specific diseases or conditions 
in order to market these products as medical devices  biosource is required to be in compliance with the fda s current good manufacturing practices and regulations 
the company believes it offers a unique combination of technological  production  and research and development skills resulting in a spectrum of products and services for the worldwide pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries 
the company manufactures products for inventory and typically ships products shortly after receipt of orders and anticipates that it will continue to do so in the future 
accordingly  the company has not developed a significant backlog of products and does not anticipate it will develop a material backlog of products in the future 
during  to better drive sales and profitability growth  and to focus on key market opportunities  the company began analyzing its business as three separate product categories  or strategic business units  sbus 
these sbus consist of signal transduction products  cytokine products  and custom products 
signal transduction products consist of the proteins  antibodies  assays and other reagents used to study internal cellular processes 
our phosphospecific antibodies and phosphoelisa tm s are included in this sbu 
cytokine products include the proteins  antibodies  assays and other reagents that are used to study the processes by which cells communicate 
interleukin  growth factor and other biological response modifier products are included in this group 
custom products includes oligonucleotides  custom peptides and antibodies  cell culture and diagnostics and other reagents not specifically categorized 
in november  the company hired terrance j 
bieker as its new president and chief executive officer 
with mr 
bieker s leadership  during the fourth quarter of  the company developed and implemented a business plan that clarifies the company s strategic focus for the future 
this fundamental shift in strategy is to focus the company s time  effort and financial resources on its core strengths as an assay company 
these assay products are higher margin products and generally fall into two categories  cytokine and signal processing assays 
the company will be placing a more direct focus in the sales of cytokine assays and their directly related products and the sales of signal transduction assays and their directly related products 
this strategic plan is designed to allow biosource to penetrate and increase its market share in the cytokine assay market and continue to maintain a strong leadership position in the signaling market  which includes the trademarked phospho elisa assays 
this strategy will focus the company s direction on these high margin products and allow it to more effectively market their complimentary product lines  including our phospho site specific antibodies  or pssa s  including its sera and media and its custom products peptides  antibodies and oligonucleotides 
as a result of this new strategic direction  certain assumptions related to fixed  working and human assets were evaluated and revised 
with a more focused approach on assay kits and the directly related product lines  other non strategic products were discontinued 
these non strategic products included outsourced cell surface marker and secondary antibodies and certain peptides  and were analyzed for profitability and overall marketability 
after its review  the company realized these products did not possess the characteristics for significant growth or adequate profit margins in order for the company to continue to provide such products 
this strategic shift has caused the company to review its existing product line and certain inventory levels and values 
in the fourth quarter of  million of the company s currently inventoried products were discontinued  scrapped or fully reserved 
for a detailed discussion  see the discussion on the consolidated results of operations below 
the implementation of the new strategy is intended to bring continued positive organic growth to the company s sales for and beyond 
the increased investment in sales and marketing  in conjunction with our new strategy is designed to bring a more focused approach to promoting and selling assays and their directly related products 
in addition  we have incorporated a corporate account strategy into our selling approach which we believe will help support our organic sales growth 
as a result of its new strategy  the company believes overall gross profit and gross product margins should improve in  when compared to due to its more focused approach on selling assays  a higher margin product than many of its other products 
as a result  the company believes operating results should also improve in compared to management s longer term financial objective is to generate increasing annual operating profits to the company

more information about potential factors that could affect our business and financial results is included in the section entitled risk factors beginning on page of this form k 
critical accounting policies general our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
specifically  management must make estimates in the following areas allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company has  in gross trade accounts receivable and  in allowance for doubtful accounts on the consolidated balance sheet at december  the company has procedures in place to adequately review the credit worthiness of new customers and also to properly review orders from existing customers to determine if a change in credit terms is warranted 
a review of our allowance for doubtful accounts is done timely and consistently throughout the year 
the company does have accounts receivable amounts from certain customers as of december  such that if their financial condition deteriorated and a significant allowance was needed  the amount of allowance could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial results for inventory adjustments 
the company reviews the components of its inventory on a regular basis for excess  obsolete and impaired inventory based on estimated future usage and sales 
in conjunction with the new strategic direction the company has taken  it may see material write downs of inventory due to obsolescence or discontinuation of certain product lines in the future 
the company will be evaluating product lines on an ongoing basis 
the manufacturing process for antibodies has and may continue to produce quantities substantially in excess of forecasted usage  if any  and anticipated antibody sales volumes are highly uncertain and realization of individual product cost may not occur 
as a result  the company reserves its entire manufactured antibody inventory at of its value 
as of december   the company had  of manufactured antibodies in its inventory and a reserve for these antibodies totaling  the company will continue to monitor its antibody inventory and the continued need for a reserve 
additionally  material inventory write downs in our inventory can occur if competitive conditions or new product introductions by our customers or us vary from our current expectations 
deferred tax assets and deferred income taxes 
the company has  in deferred income tax assets on its consolidated balance sheet as of december  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this form k for a listing of the specific components 
a large component of the company s deferred tax assets is its net operating losses 
as of december   the company has a net operating loss nol carryforward of approximately   and  for federal  state and foreign income tax purposes  respectively 
the federal nol s are available to offset future taxable income  if any  through to the state nol s are available to offset future taxable income  if any  through to as of december   the company determined it is necessary to set up a valuation allowance of  for deferred tax assets related to net operating losses it has accumulated for the state of massachusetts 
this allowance is included in the net deferred tax assets on its balance sheet as of december  the ability to realize these net deferred tax assets depends entirely on the company generating taxable income in the future 
the company has used historical information as well as a projected financial outlook to project taxable income amounts 
the company believes  except for the valuation allowance previously discussed  it is more likely than not that they will be able to realize the current value of net benefits in the future 
a material change in our expected realization of these assets would occur if the ability to deduct tax loss carryforwards against future taxable income is altered 
if our projections involving tax planning and operating strategies do not materialize or if significant changes in tax laws occur within the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate  we would have to set up a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets that could materially affect our tax expense and our financial results 
advertising costs 
for the year ended december   the company capitalized its annual catalog production costs and expensed them evenly throughout the year 
in the past  the company has expensed catalog production costs as incurred  which was primarily in the first quarter of its fiscal year 
during  and after production of the catalog  the company put substantial effort into increasing the number of customers in its customer database and in conjunction with that increased its dependence on its catalog to attract more customers 
as a result  the company believes that its catalog is a direct response advertisement whose primary purpose is to elicit sales to customers who respond specifically to the catalog resulting in probable future economic benefit 
accordingly  beginning in  the company is capitalizing its catalog production costs and expensing them evenly throughout the fiscal year in accordance with the aicpa s statement of position for the year ended december   the company expensed approximately  of catalog costs compared to  and  for the years ended december  and respectively 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
the company s revenue is generated from the sale of products primarily manufactured internally 
the company does have a small amount of products that are sold on an outside equipment oem basis 
the company sells standard and custom products directly to end users and distributors and recognizes revenue upon transfer of title to the customer  which occurs upon shipment 
general sales and payment terms to distributors are similar to those granted to end user customers 
certain end user customers prepay for product and request shipment of the product at future dates  primarily sera or media products 
the company records deferred revenue until such time as a product is shipped to a customer 
approximately of the company s net sales were to distributors 
the company s distribution agreements do not provide a general right of return 
the amount of the company s inventory held by distributors is not believed to be substantial 
long lived assets 
in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement on financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
while sfas no 
supersedes sfas no  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  it retains many of the fundamental provisions of that statement 
the standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  it is our policy  and in accordance with sfas no 
 to account for long lived assets  including intangibles  at amortized cost 
as part of an ongoing review of the valuation and amortization of long lived assets  management assesses the carrying value of such assets if facts and circumstances suggest that they may be impaired 
if this review indicates that long lived assets will not be recoverable  as determined by a non discounted cash flow analysis over the remaining amortization period  the carrying value of the company s long lived assets would be reduced to its estimated fair value based on discounted cash flows 
in the quarter ended december   the company incurred a long lived asset impairment charge of  related to the sale or disposition of certain fixed assets primarily related to the company s oligonucleotide division 
the company has determined that all its remaining long lived assets are not impaired as of december  the company s long lived assets were not impaired as of december  consolidated results of operations the selected data presented below under the caption consolidated statement of operations data presented as a percentage of sales for each of the years ended december   and are derived from the audited consolidated financial statements of the company 
the following selected data should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto  as well as the data and information included herein entitled management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
consolidated statement of operations data years ended december  presented as a percentage of sales net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative long lived asset impairment amortization of intangibles total operating expenses operating income loss interest income interest expense other income  net income loss before income tax benefit income tax expense benefit income loss before cumulative effect of accounting change cumulative effect of accounting change net income loss available to common stockholders year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
net sales for the year ended december  were a record million  an increase of million or compared to net sales for the year ended december  in  the company s revenues benefited by a  positive impact of foreign exchange when compared to for the year ended december   sales of the company s signaling product lines grew compared to the comparable prior year period  from  to  the company believes its volume of transactions in the signal transduction market is growing and has opportunities for continued significant growth in this market 
the company s sales growth in its cytokine product lines for the year ending december  was  growing from  to  the cytokine market is a mature market which the company believes continues to have opportunities for sales growth through focused sales and marketing efforts and through targeted research and development activities 
the company s sales in its custom product lines remained flat compared to the comparable prior year period at  north american sales represented of consolidated net sales in and grew as compared to the twelve months ended december  north american sales grew primarily due to increases in cytokine and signaling products offset by lower sales in our custom products  particularly our oligonucleotide product line 
european sales represented of consolidated net sales in and grew in local currency  as compared to the comparable prior year period 
european sales growth was primarily due to our signaling products  including our phospho elisa s and our diagnostic product line 
sales in japan and the rest of the world  representing of consolidated net sales  increased compared to sales growth in japan and the rest of the world was primarily due to increases in our signaling product lines and continued penetration of products into countries outside of europe and north america 
when compared to  our sales in europe and japan have increased as a percentage of total consolidated sales while north american sales have decreased as a percentage of total consolidated sales 
the company does not believe this is indicative of a long term trend and that it will see fluctuations of its sales in various geographical regions in the future 
the company experienced a slowdown in sales in the third and fourth quarters of when compared to its internal operating expectations 
the company believes this was attributable in part to a slowdown in spending by the major us pharmaceutical and biotech companies during this time and to a delay in funding to the national institutes of health  which funds many academic life science research projects throughout the united states 
gross profit 
gross profit margin was for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  the company s margin decreased due in part to the change in strategic direction discussed above 
with this change in strategic direction  various assumptions related to specific inventoried items were evaluated and revised 
with a more focused approach on assay kits and the directly related product lines  other non strategic products were discontinued 
the company reviewed its catalog of products and eliminated over non strategic products 
accordingly  in the fourth quarter of  approximately  of catalog products were discontinued and million of inventoried products were evaluated and scrapped or fully reserved 
the company continues to evaluate catalog products on an ongoing basis 
while the impact to our financial results from our continuing evaluation of catalog products is unknown at this time  any such evaluation could be material to the operating results of the company 
general increases in the company s scrap and obsolescence contributed to this margin decrease 
also contributing to this full year margin decrease were lower margins in the company s custom product lines  specifically our oligonucleotide and custom peptide product lines 
steps have been taken to reduce our cost of manufacturing in the custom product lines and we are projecting to see an improvement in consolidated gross profit margin in research and development 
research and development expense for the year ended december  and was million and million and represented and of sales  respectively 
the increase in research and development expenses for the year ended december  when compared to the prior year period reflects the company s increased expenses for additional personnel and materials in the cytokine and signal transduction research areas 
for the year  the company increased r d spending by and expects  with the focus on cellular pathway assays and related biologicals  to keep spending in line with spending levels 
this total investment in the company s research capabilities has resulted in the commercialization of high quality  novel products which have produced increased sales in both the cytokine and signaling product lines 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses were  for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december   representing of sales for each of the years and in the twelve months ended december   the company s sales and marketing payroll and related expenses increased  from due to increased commissions and the hiring of certain sales and marketing positions in late and a new vice president of sales in december marketing expenses including catalogs  advertising  and trade shows decreased  in compared to travel expenses increased  due to increased costs related primarily to selling activities 
the company anticipates a continued increased investment in its sales and marketing  but will manage this investment in line with anticipated revenue growth 
for the year ended december   the company expensed approximately  of catalog costs compared to  for the year ended december  general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses were  and  for the years ended december  and  representing and of sales for each of the years and  respectively 
this represents an increase of g a expenses in of  compared to included in the g a number is  of severance and sign on expenses related to the resignation of our previous ceo in september and the hiring of our new ceo in november additional severance costs related to other employee terminations in totaled  excluding this  of costs  general and administrative expenses increased by  compared to and represented of sales 
this increase was due primarily to increases in our reserve for doubtful accounts  travel expenses  consulting and accounting fees 
these increases in expenses were offset by a decrease in certain benefit and incentive costs due to the lower than planned operating performance in  and thus lower incentives being accrued for the company in compared to amortization of intangibles

income tax expense benefit 
the company is recognizing an income tax benefit of  for the year ended december  the company s income taxes have and may continue to fluctuate in the future depending on a number of factors  including the ability to use its net deferred tax assets as of december  the company believes it is more likely than not that it will be able to use those assets 
in addition  the company continues to benefit from r d and other tax credits which  when applied to income levels for the periods presented  is resulting in effective tax rates lower than the current applicable federal and state statutory rates

risk factors you should carefully consider the following risk factors and all other information contained in this report before purchasing shares of our common stock 
investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk 
if any of the following events or outcomes actually occurs  our business  operating results and financial condition would likely suffer 
as a result  the trading price of our common stock could decline  and you may lose all or part of the money you paid to purchase our common stock 
risks related to our business failure to execute on our newly adopted long term strategic plan could impair our business 
the company historically has sought to increase its sales and profitability primarily through the acquisition or internal development of new product lines  additional customers and new businesses 
our historical revenue growth is primarily attributable to our acquisitions and new product development and  to a lesser extent  to increased revenues from our existing products 
in the quarter ended december   we adopted a fundamental shift in strategy to focus our time  effort and financial resources on our core strengths as an assay company 
we have built a strategic plan to continue to penetrate and increase our market share in the cytokine assay market and continue to maintain a strong leadership position in the phospho elisa assay market 
this strategy will focus our energies on these high margin products and allow us to pull through our complimentary product lines  including our phospho site specific antibodies  or pssa s  sera and media and our custom products  peptides  antibodies and oligonucleotides 
our ability to achieve our new strategic objectives depends upon a variety of factors  including o the market s continuing acceptance of our assay products  o our ability to internally develop new products  o our ability to acquire products or licenses to necessary technologies  o our ability to facilitate transactions with strategic partners  o establishment of new relationships or expansion of existing relationships with customers and suppliers  and o availability of capital 
additionally  our shift in strategy has caused us to evaluate other non strategic products  such as outsourced cell surface marker antibodies and discontinue them 
the company reviewed its catalog of products and eliminated over non strategic products 
accordingly  in the fourth quarter of  approximately  of catalog products were discontinued and million of inventoried products were evaluated and scrapped or fully reserved 
this evaluation of catalog products is expected to continue in the future 
while the impact to our financial results from our continuing evaluation of catalog products is unknown at this time  any such evaluation could be material to the operating results of the company 
if our management is unable to manage this strategic shift effectively  our operating results could be adversely affected 
moreover  there can be no assurance that our historic rate of growth will continue through this strategic shift  that we will continue to successfully expand or that growth or expansion will result in profitability 
we cannot guarantee that our future acquisitions will be successful 
the company competes for acquisition and expansion opportunities with companies which have significantly greater financial and management resources than us 
there can be no assurance that suitable acquisition or investment opportunities will be identified  that any of these transactions can be consummated  or that  if acquired  these new businesses can be integrated successfully and profitably into our operations 
these acquisitions and investments may also require a significant allocation of resources  which will reduce our ability to focus on the other portions of our business  including many of the factors listed in the prior risk factor 
reduction or delays in research and development budgets and in government funding may negatively impact our sales 
our customers include researchers at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  academic institutions and government and private laboratories 
fluctuations in the research and development budgets of these researchers and their organizations could have a significant effect on the demand for our products 
research and development budgets fluctuate due to numerous factors that are outside our control and are difficult to predict  including changes in available resources  spending priorities and institutional budgetary policies 
our business could be seriously damaged by any significant decrease in life sciences research and development expenditures by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  academic institutions or government and private laboratories 
a significant portion of our sales has been to researchers  universities  government laboratories and private foundations whose funding is dependent upon grants from government agencies such as the us national institutes of health and similar domestic and international agencies 
although the level of research funding has increased during the past several years  we cannot assure that this trend will continue 
government funding of research and development is subject to the political process  which is inherently fluid and unpredictable 
our revenues may be adversely affected if our customers delay purchases as a result of uncertainties surrounding the approval of government budget proposals 
also  government proposals to reduce or eliminate budgetary deficits have sometimes included reduced allocations to the nih and other government agencies that fund research and development activities 
a reduction in government funding for the nih or other government research agencies could seriously damage our business 
many of our customers receive funds from approved grants at particular times of the year  as determined by the federal government 
grants have  in the past  been frozen for extended periods or have otherwise become unavailable to various institutions without advance notice 
the timing of the receipt of grant funds affects the timing of purchase decisions by our customers and  as a result  can cause fluctuations in our sales and operating results 
we rely on raw materials and specialized equipment for our manufacturing  which we may not always be able to obtain on favorable terms 
our manufacturing process relies on the continued availability of high quality raw materials and specialized equipment 
it is possible that a change in vendors  or in the quality of the raw materials supplied to us  could have an adverse impact on our manufacturing process and  ultimately  on the sale of our finished products 
we have from time to time experienced a disruption in the quality or availability of key raw materials  which has created minor delays in our ability to fill orders for specific test kits 
this could occur again in the future  resulting in significant delays  and could have a detrimental impact on the sale of our products and our results of operations 
in addition  we rely on highly specialized manufacturing equipment that if damaged or disabled could adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products and therefore negatively impact our business 
we rely on the timely transport of raw materials 
any disruption in transportation systems could have an adverse impact on our ability to manufacture and supply products 
our ability to raise the capital necessary to expand our business or otherwise achieve our long term objectives is uncertain 
in the future  in order to expand our business through internal development or acquisitions or to otherwise achieve our long term objectives  we may need to raise substantial additional funds through equity or debt financings  research and development financings or collaborative relationships 
however  this additional funding may not be available or  if available  it may not be available on economically reasonable terms 
in addition  any additional funding may result in significant dilution to existing stockholders 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to curtail our operations or obtain funds through collaborative partners that may require us to release material rights to our products 
our research and development efforts for new products may be unsuccessful 
we incur significant research and development expenses to develop new products and technologies 
there can be no assurance that any of these products or technologies will be successfully developed or that if developed  will be commercially successful 
in the event that we are unable to develop commercialized products from our research and development efforts or we are unable or unwilling to allocate amounts beyond our currently anticipated research and development investment  we could lose our entire investment in these new products and technologies 
any failure to translate research and development expenditures into successful new product introductions could have an adverse effect on our business 
failure to license new technologies could impair our new product development 
our business model of providing products to researchers working on a variety of genetic projects requires us to develop a wide spectrum of products 
to generate broad product lines it is advantageous to sometimes license technologies from others rather than depending exclusively on our own employees 
as a result  we believe our ability to license new technologies from third parties is and will continue to be important to our ability to offer new products 
in addition  from time to time we are notified or become aware of patents held by third parties that are related to technologies we are selling or may sell in the future 
after a review of these patents  we may decide to obtain a license for these technologies from these third parties or discontinue the products 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to successfully identify new technologies developed by others 
even if we are able to identify new technologies of interest  we may not be able to negotiate a license on favorable terms  or at all 
if we lose the rights to patented technology  we may need to discontinue selling certain products or redesign our products  and we may lose a competitive advantage 
potential competitors could in license technologies that we fail to license and potentially erode our market share for certain products 
our licenses typically subject us to various commercialization  sublicensing  minimum payment  and other obligations 
if we fail to comply with these requirements  we could lose important rights under a license 
in addition  certain rights granted under the license could be lost for reasons out of our control 
for example  the licensor could lose patent protection for a number of reasons  including invalidity of the licensed patent 
we do not always receive significant indemnification from a licensor against third party claims of intellectual property infringement 
we are currently in the process of negotiating several of these licenses and expect that we will also negotiate these types of licenses in the future 
there can be no assurances that we will be able to negotiate these licenses on favorable terms  or at all 
our future success depends on the timely introduction of new products and the acceptance of these new products in the marketplace 
our ability to gain access to technologies needed for new products and services also depends in part on our ability to convince licensors that we can successfully commercialize their inventions 
we cannot assure that we will be able to continue to identify new technologies developed by others 
even if we are able to identify new technologies of interest  we may not be able to negotiate a license on favorable terms  or at all 
if we fail to introduce new products  or our new products are not accepted by potential customers  we may lose market share 
rapid technological change and frequent new product introductions are typical for the markets we serve 
our future success will depend in part on continuous  timely development and introduction of new products that address evolving market requirements 
we believe successful new product introductions provide a significant competitive advantage because customers make an investment of time in selecting and learning to use a new product  and then are reluctant to switch 
to the extent we fail to introduce new and innovative products  we may lose market share to our competitors  which will be difficult or impossible to regain 
any inability  for technological or other reasons  to successfully develop and introduce new products could reduce our growth rate or damage our business 
in the past we have experienced  and are likely to experience in the future  delays in the development and introduction of products 
we cannot assure that we will keep pace with the rapid rate of change in life sciences research or that our new products will adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace or achieve market acceptance 
some of the factors affecting market acceptance of new products include o availability  quality and price relative to competitive products  o the timing of introduction of the product relative to competitive products  o customers opinion of the products utility  o ease of use  o consistency with prior practices  o scientists opinion of the product s usefulness  o citation of the product in published research  and o general trends in life sciences research 
the expenses or losses associated with unsuccessful product development activities or lack of market acceptance of our new products could materially adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
the development  introduction and marketing of innovative products in our rapidly evolving markets will require significant sustained investment 
we cannot assure their cash from operations or other sources will be sufficient to meet these ongoing requirements 
failure to attract and retain qualified scientific or production personnel or loss of key management or key personnel could hurt our business 
recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and production personnel to perform research and development work and product manufacturing are critical to our success 
because the industry in which we compete is very competitive  we face significant challenges attracting and retaining this qualified personnel base 
although we believe we have been and will be able to attract and retain these personnel  there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to successfully attract qualified personnel 
in addition  our anticipated growth and expansion into areas and activities requiring additional expertise  such as clinical testing  government approvals  production and marketing  will require the addition of new management personnel and the development of additional expertise by existing management personnel 
the failure to attract and retain these personnel or  alternatively  to develop this expertise internally would adversely affect our business 
we generally do not enter into employment agreements requiring these employees to continue in our employment for any period of time 
our success also will continue to depend to a significant extent on the members of our management team 
we do not maintain any key man insurance policies regarding any of these individuals 
we may not be able to retain the services of our executive officers and key personnel or attract additional qualified members to management in the future 
the loss of services of our key management or employees could have a material adverse effect upon our business 
many of our customers are obtaining our products through new distribution channels and methods that may adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition 
a number of our customers have developed purchasing initiatives to reduce the number of vendors they purchase from in order to lower their supply costs 
in some cases  these customers have established agreements with large distributors which include discounts and the distributors direct involvement with the purchasing process 
for similar reasons  many larger customers  including the federal government  have special pricing arrangements  including blanket purchase agreements 
these agreements may limit our pricing flexibility with respect to our products  which could adversely impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  although we accept and process some orders through our internet website  we also implement sales through a third party internet vendor 
internet sales through third parties will negatively impact our gross margins because we pay commission on these internet sales 
on the other hand  if we do not enter into arrangements with third party e commerce providers  we may lose customers who prefer to purchase products using these web sites 
our business may be harmed as a result of these web sites or other sales methods which may be developed in the future 
we rely on air transport to ship products to our customers any disruption in standard air transport systems could have an adverse effect on our business 
we rely on international sales  which are subject to additional risks 
international sales accounted for approximately of our revenues in  of our revenues in  and of our revenues in international sales can be subject to many inherent risks that are difficult or impossible for us to predict or control  including o unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and tariffs  o difficulties and costs associated with in staffing and managing foreign operations  including foreign distributor relationships  o longer accounts receivable collection cycles in certain foreign countries  adverse economic or political changes  o unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  o more limited protection for intellectual property in some countries  o changes in our international distribution network and direct sales force  o potential trade restrictions  exchange controls and import and export licensing requirements  o problems in collecting accounts receivable  and o potentially adverse tax consequences of overlapping tax structure 
impairment of the ability to transport goods internationally 
we intend to continue to generate revenues from sales outside north america in the future 
future distribution of our products outside north america also may be subject to greater governmental regulation 
these regulations  which include requirements for approvals or clearance to market  additional time required for regulatory review and sanctions imposed for violations  as well as the other risks indicated in the bullets listed above  vary by country 
we may not be able to obtain regulatory approvals in the countries in which we currently sell our products or in countries where we may sell our products in the future 
in addition  we may be required to incur significant costs in obtaining necessary regulatory approvals 
failure to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or any other failure to comply with regulatory requirements could result in a material reduction in our revenues and earnings 
we also depend on third party distributors for a material portion of our international sales 
if we lose or suffer any significant reduction in sales to any material distributor  our business could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  approximately of our sales are made in foreign currencies  primarily euros and british pounds 
a significant portion of the foreign currencies in which we conduct our business is currently denominated in euros 
the company is not certain about the effect of the euro on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in the past  gains and losses on the collection of our accounts receivable arising from international operations have contributed to negative fluctuations in our results of operations 
in general  increases in the exchange rate of the united states dollar to foreign currencies cause our products to become relatively more expensive to customers in those countries  leading to a reduction in sales or profitability in some cases 
we historically have not  and currently are not  using hedging transactions or other means to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the value of the united states dollar as compared to the foreign currencies in which many of our sales are made 
our operating results may fluctuate 
our operating results may vary significantly quarter to quarter and from year to year as a result of a variety of factors 
these factors include o level of demand for our products  o changes in our customer and product mix  o timing of acquisitions and investments in infrastructure  o competitive conditions  o timing and extent of intellectual property litigation  o exchange rate fluctuations  and o general economic and political conditions 
we believe that quarterly comparisons of our financial results may not necessarily be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
additionally  if our operating results in one or more quarters do not meet the expectations of security analysts or others  the price of our common stock could be materially adversely affected 
our continued investment in product development and sales and marketing are significantly ongoing expenses 
if revenue in a particular period falls short of expectations  we may not be able to reduce significantly our expenditures for that period  which would materially adversely affect the operating results for that period 
we may be unable to protect our trademarks  trade secrets and other intellectual property rights that are important to our business 
we regard our trademarks  trade secrets and other intellectual property as a component of our success 
we rely on trademark law and trade secret protection and confidentiality and or license agreements with employees  customers  partners and others to protect our intellectual property 
effective trademark and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our products are available 
we cannot be certain that we have taken adequate steps to protect our intellectual property  especially in countries where the laws may not protect our rights as fully as in the united states 
in addition  our third party confidentiality agreements can be breached and  if they are  there may not be an adequate remedy available to us 
if our trade secrets become known  we may lose our competitive position 
intellectual property or other litigation could harm our business 
litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights is extensive in the biotechnology industry 
we are aware that patents have been applied for  and in some cases issued to others  claiming technologies that are closely related to ours 
as a result  and in part due to the ambiguities and evolving nature of intellectual property law  we periodically receive notices of potential infringement of patents held by others 
although to date we have successfully resolved these types of claims  we may not be able to do so in the future 
in the event of an intellectual property dispute  we may be forced to litigate 
this litigation could involve proceedings declared by the us patent and trademark office or the international trade commission  as well as proceedings brought directly by affected third parties 
intellectual property litigation can be extremely expensive  and these expenses  as well as the consequences should we not prevail  could seriously harm our business 
if a third party claimed an intellectual property right to technology we use  we might need to discontinue an important product or product line  alter our products and processes  pay license fees or cease our affected business activities 
although we might under these circumstances attempt to obtain a license to this intellectual property  we may not be able to do so on favorable terms  or at all 
in addition to intellectual property litigation  other substantial  complex or extended litigation could result in large expenditures by us and distraction of our management 
for example  lawsuits by employees  stockholders  collaborators or distributors could be very costly and substantially disrupt our business 
disputes from time to time with companies or individuals are not uncommon in our industry  and we cannot assure you that we will always be able to resolve them out of court 
accidents related to hazardous materials could adversely affect our business 
portions of our operations require the controlled use of hazardous and radioactive materials 
although we believe our safety procedures comply with the standards prescribed by federal  state  local and foreign regulations  the risk of accidental contamination of property or injury to individuals from these materials cannot be completely eliminated 
in the event of an accident  we could be liable for any damages that result  which could seriously damage our business and results of operations 
our sales are subject to seasonality  which means that we have less revenue in some months 
we experience a slowing of sales in europe during the summer months and worldwide during the christmas holidays 
generally  our fourth quarter revenues are lower than our revenues in each of the first three quarters of the year 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results may not necessarily be reliable indicators of our future performance 
it is likely that in some future period our operating results will not meet expectations or those of public market analysts  which could result in reductions in the market price of our common stock 
potential product liability claims could affect our earnings and financial condition 
we face a potential risk of liability claims based on our products and services  and we have faced such claims in the past 
we carry product liability insurance coverage which is limited in scope and amount but which we believe to be adequate 
we cannot assure you  however  that we will be able to maintain this insurance at reasonable cost and on reasonable terms 
we also cannot assure that this insurance will be adequate to protect us against a product liability claim  should one arise 
the labor laws applicable to our employees in europe may restrict the flexibility of our management 
as of march   of our employees worked for our biosource europe subsidiary  which is located in nivelles  belgium 
as a result of belgian labor laws  we are required to make specified severance payments in the event we terminate a european employee 
accordingly  our management may be limited by the application of the belgian labor laws in the determination of staffing levels  and may have less flexibility in making such determinations than our competitors whose employees are not subject to similar labor laws 
risks associated with our industry the biomedical research products industry is very competitive  and we may be unable to continue to compete effectively in this industry in the future 
we are engaged in a segment of the biomedical research products industry that is highly competitive 
we compete with many other suppliers and new competitors continue to enter the markets 
many of our competitors  both in the united states and elsewhere  are major pharmaceutical  chemical and biotechnology companies  and many of them have substantially greater capital resources  marketing experience  research and development staffs  and facilities than we do 
any of these companies could succeed in developing products that are more effective than the products that we have or may develop and may also be more successful than us in producing and marketing their products 
we expect this competition to continue and intensify in the future 
competition in our markets is primarily driven by o product performance  features and liability  o price  o timing of product introductions  o ability to develop  maintain and protect proprietary products and technologies  o sales and distribution capabilities  o technical support and service  o brand royalty  o applications support  and o breadth of product line 
if a competitor develops superior technology or cost effective alternatives to our products  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
our competitors have in the past and may in the future compete by lowering prices 
our failure to anticipate and respond to price competition could reduce our revenues and profits  and may damage our market share 
our industry has also seen substantial consolidation in recent years  which has led to the creation of competitors with greater financial and intellectual property resources than us 
in addition  we believe that the success that others have had in our industry will attract new competitors 
some of our current and future competitors also may cooperate to better compete against us 
we may not be able to compete effectively against these current or future competitors 
increased competition could result in price reductions for our products  reduced margins and loss of market share  any of which could adversely impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
as a result of consolidation in the pharmaceutical industry  we may lose existing customers or have greater difficulty obtaining new customers 
in recent years  the united states pharmaceutical industry has undergone substantial consolidation 
as part of many business combinations  companies frequently reduce the number of suppliers used and we may not be selected as a supplier after any business combination 
further  mergers or corporate consolidations in the pharmaceutical industry could cause us to lose existing customers and potential future customers  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are currently subject to government regulation 
our business is currently subject to regulation  supervision and licensing by federal  state and local governmental authorities 
also  from time to time we must expend resources to comply with newly adopted regulations  as well as changes in existing regulations 
if we fail to comply with these regulations  we could be subject to disciplinary actions or administrative enforcement actions 
these actions could result in penalties  including fines 
risks associated with our common stock our stock price has been volatile 
our common stock is quoted on the nasdaq national market  and there has been substantial volatility in the market price of our common stock 
the trading price of our common stock has been  and is likely to continue to be  subject to significant fluctuations due to a variety of factors  including o fluctuations in our quarterly operating and earnings per share results  o the gain or loss of significant contracts  o loss of key personnel  o announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors  o delays in the development and introduction of new products  o legislative or regulatory changes  o general trends in the industry  o recommendations and or changes in estimates by equity and market research analysts  o biological or medical discoveries  o disputes and or developments concerning intellectual property  including patents and litigation matters  o public concern as to the safety of new technologies  o sales of common stock of existing holders  o securities class action or other litigation  o developments in our relationships with current or future customers and suppliers  and o general economic conditions  both in the united states and abroad 
as a result of these factors  and potentially others  the sales price of our common stock has ranged from to per share from january  through march  and from to per share from january  through march  for additional information regarding the price range of our common stock  see item market for registrant s common equity and related stockholder matters 
in addition  the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of our common stock  as well as the stock of many biotechnology companies 
often  price fluctuations are unrelated to operating performance of the specific companies whose stock is affected 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s stock  securities class action litigation has occurred against the issuing company 
if we were subject to this type of litigation in the future  we could incur substantial costs and a diversion of our management s attention and resources  each of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and earnings 
any adverse determination in this type of litigation could also subject us to significant liabilities 
anti takeover provisions in our governing documents and under applicable law could impair the ability of a third party to take over our company 
we are subject to various legal and contractual provisions that may impede a change in our control  including the following o our adoption of a stockholders rights plan  which could result in the significant dilution of the proportionate ownership of any person that engages in an unsolicited attempt to take over our company  and o the ability of our board of directors to issue additional shares of our preferred stock  which shares may be given superior voting  liquidation  distribution and other rights as compared to our common stock 
these provisions  as well as other provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and under the delaware general corporations law  may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire our company  even if the acquisition attempt was at a premium over the market value of our common stock at that time 
our principal stockholders and management own a significant percentage of our capital stock and will be able to exercise significant influence over our affairs 
our executive officers  directors and principal stockholders will continue to beneficially own of our outstanding common stock  based upon the beneficial ownership of our common stock as of march  in addition  these same persons also hold options to acquire additional shares of our common stock  which may increase their percentage ownership of the common stock further in the future 
accordingly  these stockholders o will be able to significantly influence the composition of our board of directors  o will significantly influence all matters requiring stockholder approval  including change of control transactions  and o will continue to have significant influence over our business 
this concentration of ownership of our common stock could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of us or otherwise discouraging a potential acquirer from attempting to obtain control of us 
this in turn could have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock 
it could also prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium over the market prices for their shares of common stock 
our principal stockholders and management own a significant percentage of our capital stock and will be able to exercise significant influence over our affairs 
our executive officers  directors and principal stockholders beneficially own approximately of our outstanding common stock  based upon the beneficial ownership of our common stock as of march  as a result  these stockholders  if they act together  could exert substantial influence over matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election of directors and approval of mergers and other significant corporate transactions 
the voting power of such persons may have the effect of delaying  preventing or deterring a change in control  and could affect the market price of our common stock 
absence of dividends could reduce our attractiveness to you 
some investors favor companies that pay dividends  particularly in general downturns in the stock market 
we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock 
we currently intend to retain any future earnings for funding growth and we do not currently anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
because we may not pay dividends  the return on this investment likely depends on selling this stock at a profit 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we conduct business in various foreign currencies  including euros and british pounds  and are therefore subject to the transaction exposures that arise from foreign exchange rate movements between the dates that foreign currency transactions are initiated and the dates that they are converted 
we are also subject to exchange rate exposures arising from the translation and consolidation of the financial results of our foreign subsidiaries 
although a significant portion of the foreign currencies in which we conduct our business is currently  or is anticipated in the future to be  denominated in euros as a result of the european monetary union  we are not certain about the effect of the euro on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we do not currently hedge either our translation risk or our economic risk associated with the exchange of foreign currencies into us dollars 
there can be no assurances that future changes in currency exchange rates will not have a material impact on our future cash collections and operating results 
our exposure to market risks for changes in interest rates relates primarily to outstanding commercial debt 
due to the pay down of our commercial debt  we anticipate no material market risk exposure for changes in interest rates 
accordingly  we have not included quantitative tabular disclosures
