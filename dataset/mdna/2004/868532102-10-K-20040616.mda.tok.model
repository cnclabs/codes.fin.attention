item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview supertex designs  develops  manufactures  and markets high voltage analog and mixed signal integrated circuits utilizing state of the art high voltage dmos  hvcmos and hvbicmos analog and mixed signal technologies 
we supply standard and custom interface products primarily for the use in the telecommunications  imaging  and medical electronics markets 
we also provide wafer foundry services for the manufacture of integrated circuits for customers using customer owned designs and mask toolings 
factors which may affect operating results semiconductor companies as a group are subject to many similar risks 
these include the risks that the demand for semiconductors decreases as the industry has historically been very cyclical  there are shortages of raw materials and or fab capacity  or there are changes in underlying circuit or process technology or fab technology 
other factors that could affect our future results include whether we can generate new bookings from both new and current products  general economic conditions  both in the united states and foreign markets  and economic conditions specific to the semiconductor industry  risks associated with customer concentration  our ability to introduce new products  to enhance existing products  and to meet the continually changing requirements of our customers  our ability to maintain and enhance relationships with our assembly and test subcontractors and independent distributors and sales representatives  and whether we can manufacture efficiently and control costs 
in addition  we are subject to the risks described below  which are specific to our business we have focused our product offerings primarily on niche markets which leverage our capabilities and in which we believe we have dominance 
we attempt to choose markets which are sizable enough to be worth pursuing but which are not large enough to attract fierce competition 
these markets could grow enough to attract increased competition or else competitors could enter due to happenstance or downturns elsewhere 
in addition  these niches might be more susceptible to shrinkage than more diverse markets  due to their concentration on a few product offerings 
we work with our customers to develop products  which they will design into their systems 
even if we do achieve a design win  the customer s system may never go into production or the production may be smaller than we had anticipated 
although we attempt to develop products which will be useful for multiple customers  we may misjudge the market and develop a product which maybe useful for very few customers 
we are dependent upon one fab which we own and operate 
we would be susceptible were this fab to be unable to meet our needs  for example  were this fab to become obsolete due to process technology changes  or to be damaged  for example by fire or earthquake 
we could encounter difficulties in operating our fab  such as contaminants in the air or defects in equipment  which could affect yields and production 
we have several competitors which are substantially larger and could bring to bear substantially more resources in our niche markets 
we have been able to maintain profitable margins in part because of our dominance of most of our niche markets 
increased competition could cause our margins to decrease 
henry pao  a director of and the president and ceo of the company  along with mr 
pao s father and brother  collectively own greater than of our outstanding stock 
they have no agreement among themselves to act together with respect to the company or their stockholdings 
however  were they to act in concert  they would be our largest beneficial shareholder and would have an ability to elect one or more directors  to direct management  and to delay or prevent a change in control 
we sell a substantial amount of our products internationally 
we also package and test most of our products abroad 
problems with foreign economies  political turmoil  wars  changes in the exchange rate  or epidemics  such as sars could adversely affect our foreign sales or foreign product assembly 
our operations may be interrupted and our business would be harmed in the event of an earthquake  terrorist act  and other disaster 
our principal executive offices  our fab facility  and major suppliers are located in areas that have been subject to severe earthquakes 
in the event of an earthquake  we and or our major suppliers may be temporarily unable to continue operations and may suffer significant property damage 
any such interruption in our ability or that of our major suppliers to continue operations at our facilities could delay the development and shipment of our products 
like other us companies  our business and operating results are subject to uncertainties arising out of the recent terrorist attacks on the united states  including the potential worsening or extension of the current global economic slowdown  the economic consequences of current and potential military actions or additional terrorist activities and associated political instability  and the impact of heightened security concerns on domestic and international travel and commerce 
such uncertainties could also lead to delays or cancellations of customer orders  a general decrease in corporate spending or our inability to effectively market and sell our products 
any of these results could substantially harm our business and results of operations  causing a decrease in our revenues 
we depended upon one customer  microtek inc  for approximately of our fiscal year sales 
microtek is our primary distributor in japan with at least twenty end user customers 
most of our customers can typically cancel or reschedule orders without penalty so decreased demand for our products could translate into rapid decreases in sales volume 
we are very dependent upon continued innovation of our engineers 
the competition for engineers with relevant experience is extremely intense in the silicon valley  where most of our engineers are located 
we must compete in terms of salary  benefits  and working conditions with many start ups which can offer more equity 
we established an ic design center in hong kong in fiscal where competition for qualified engineer is not as intense as that in silicon valley 
however  a majority of our product innovation activities remains in our sunnyvale and san jose offices 
we operate a fab in san jose  california at which we use various chemicals and solvents which are regulated by various environmental agencies 
we cooperate and work with these agencies to comply with these regulations 
should we nonetheless inadvertently contaminate the soil or ground water  or should the previous operator of the fab have done so  we may be responsible for significant costs to remediate the situation 
we are dependent upon the continued service of several of our key management and technical personnel 
the loss of the services of one or more of our engineers  executive officers and other key personnel or our inability to recruit replacements for  or to attract  retain and motivate these individuals would be harmful to our business 
we do not have long term employment contracts with our employees 
our success depends upon our ability to protect our intellectual property  including patents  trade secrets  and know how  and to continue our technological innovation 
we cannot assure that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property will be adequate to prevent misappropriation or that others will not develop competitive technologies or products 
the failure to obtain necessary licenses or other rights could cause us to lose market share and harm our business 
recently enacted changes in securities laws and regulations are likely to increase our costs 
the sarbanes oxley act of that became law in july requires changes in some of our corporate governance practices 
in addition to final rules made by the securities and exchange commission  nasdaq has revised its requirements for companies that are nasdaq listed 
these new rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs  and make some activities more difficult  time consuming and or costly 
these new rules and regulations also make it more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance  and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage 
these new rules and regulations could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors  particularly to serve on our audit committee  and qualified executive officers 
the fasb and various federal legislative proposals have proposed changes to gaap that may require us to adopt a different method of determining the compensation expense for our employee stock options 
we currently use the intrinsic value method to measure compensation expense for stock based awards to our employees 
under this standard  we generally do not consider stock option grants issued under our employee stock option plans to be compensation when the exercise price of the stock option is equal to the fair market value on the date of grant 
if any change to gaap is adopted that requires us to adopt a different method of determining the compensation expense for our employee stock options  our reported results of operations may be adversely affected 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  notes to consolidated financial statements and selected consolidated financial data included elsewhere in this form k 
the following table sets forth items from the consolidated statements of income as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated fiscal year ended march  net sales cost of sales research and development selling  general and administrative income from operations other income interest income other income expense  net income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to our revenues  product returns  bad debts  inventories  investments  asset impairments  and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
we consider the accounting policies described below to be our critical accounting policies 
these critical accounting policies affect our significant judgments  assumptions  and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
our management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to them in this report revenue recognition we recognize revenue from direct product sales to end user customers upon transfer of title and risk of loss  which is upon shipment of the product provided persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  no significant obligations remain and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
for sales to original equipment manufacturers oems  we use either a binding purchase order or signed agreement as evidence of an arrangement 
sales through our distributors are evidenced by a distributor agreement governing the relationship together with binding purchase orders on a transaction by transaction basis 
sales to our distributors are made primarily under arrangements allowing limited rights of return  limited price protection and the right of stock rotation on merchandise unsold by the distributors 
because of the uncertainty associated with pricing concessions and possible returns  we defer the recognition of such sales and the related costs of sales until our distributors have sold the merchandise to their end user customers 
our deferred revenue also includes upfront billings from customers under non recurring engineering nre contracts as well as a customer advance under a licensing agreement 
sales returns and other allowances we record a provision for estimated sales returns and allowances on product sales in the same period as the related revenues are recorded 
we base these estimates on historical experience  analysis of outstanding return material authorization rma and allowance authorization aa data and any other form of notification we receive of pending returns 
we continuously monitor and track product returns and in circumstances where we are aware of specific customer return or allowance which is over and above normal historical sales returns  we record a specific allowance against the amounts due to reduce our net receivable for such customer 
while our sales returns have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same return rates that we have in the past 
any significant increase in product failure rates and the resulting credit returns could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the period or periods in which such returns materialize 
allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on two methods 
the amounts calculated from each of these methods are combined to determine the total amount reserved 
first  a minimum allowance is established for all customers based on a percentage applied to outstanding accounts receivable 
this percentage is based on our historical collection and write off experience 
second  we evaluate specific accounts where we have information that a specific customer may have an inability to meet its financial obligations bankruptcy  etc 
to us 
in these cases  significant management judgments and estimates must be made  based on the best available facts and circumstances 
we record a specific allowance for that customer against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
these specific reserves are re evaluated and adjusted as additional information is received that impacts the amount reserved 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory valuation our inventories are stated at the lower of cost determined on a first in  first out basis or market value and include high technology parts and components that are specialized in nature and subject to rapid technological obsolescence 
standard manufacturing cost includes materials  labor  and overhead costs including depreciation  and includes factors for estimated production yield and throughput time 
we determine the market value of our inventories based on the average selling price of our products in the last three months prior to the balance sheet date 
inventory balances are adjusted to approximate the lower of our standard manufacturing cost or market value 
any adjustment to write down inventory to market value is charged to the cost of sales in the period that the adjustment is made 
we evaluate our ending inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence at each balance sheet date 
this evaluation includes analyses of sales levels by product and projections of future demand 
inventories on hand in excess of forecasted demand and inventories that we consider obsolete are reserved for 
additions to the provision are charged to the cost of sales 
subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the reduction of the allowance until these inventories are subsequently sold or scrapped  after which the related allowance is matched to the movement of the related product inventory  resulting in lower costs and higher gross margins for those products 
while the company has programs to minimize the required inventories on hand and considers technological obsolescence when estimating amounts required to reduce recorded amounts to market values  it is reasonably possible that such estimates could change in the near term 
if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections  additional inventory write downs may be required and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made 
accounting for investments and consolidation from time to time we may make investments in privately held companies  which requires us to determine the carrying value of such investments 
we currently own stock in two privately held companies whose carrying value we determined is zero as of march  and march  investments in privately held companies that are not publicly traded have no established market 
we have a policy in place to review the fair value of these investments on a regular basis to evaluate the carrying value of the investments in these companies 
this policy includes  but is not limited to  reviewing each of the companies cash position  financing needs  earnings revenue outlook  operational performance  management ownership changes  and competition 
the evaluation process is based on information that we request from these privately held companies 
this information is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as us public companies  and as such  the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and the accuracy of the data received from these companies 
if we believe that the carrying value of an investment is in excess of its fair value  it is our policy to record a reserve and the related write down is recorded as an investment loss on our consolidated statements of income 
we record an investment impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
when a decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary  we recognize an impairment loss in the current period to the extent of the decline below the carrying value of the investment 
estimating the fair value of non marketable equity investments in early stage technology companies is inherently subjective and may contribute to significant volatility in our reported results of operations 
in addition  adverse operating results of underlying long term investments could result in additional other than temporary losses in future periods 
impairment of long lived assets we routinely consider whether indicators of impairment of long lived assets are present 
if such indicators are present  we determine whether the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets in question is less than their carrying value 
if less  we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values 
fair value is determined by discounted future cash flows  appraisals or other methods 
if the assets determined to be impaired are to be held and used  we recognize an impairment charge to the extent the present value of anticipated net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than the asset s carrying value 
the fair value of the asset then becomes the asset s new carrying value  which we depreciate or amortize over the remaining estimated useful life of the asset where appropriate 
we may incur impairment losses in future periods if factors influencing our estimates change 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheets 
we evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets annually 
we have determined that no valuation allowance is required because  although realization is not assured  the company has sufficient taxable income in carryback years to absorb items deductible in the future for federal tax purposes and anticipates that its estimated future taxable income will allow the deferred tax asset for state tax purposes to be fully realized in future years 
the amount of the deferred tax asset that is realizable could be reduced in the near term if actual results differ significantly from estimates of future taxable income 
the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
see our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which begin on page of this annual report on form k which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles 
recent developments beginning the fourth quarter of fiscal  the global semiconductor industry conditions experienced a severe downturn that continued through the second half of fiscal during this time  conditions in all the markets we serve were weak 
demand for our products decreased  and sales were adversely impacted resulting in a sequential decline in fiscal years  and despite these declining sales  we have remained profitable and generated positive cash flows through rigorous cost control measures 
we experienced a modest recovery in sales in the second half of fiscal year we are hopeful that with expected improvements in the economy over the coming quarters  the business of our customers will increase leading to increased sales for us as well 
we believe that we will be able to substantially meet our production needs from our wafer fabrication and testing facilities in the coming fiscal year 
quote activities and design wins have been strong in all the markets we serve 
we have seen a higher sequential backlog and a book to bill ratio of greater than one  which are encouraging indicators for sales growth in the new fiscal year 
book to bill ratio is defined as sales orders received over orders shipped during the fiscal quarter 
we believe that current orders will be shipped in fiscal however  our customers may cancel or reschedule orders without significant penalty  and the price of products may be adjusted between the time the purchase order is booked into backlog and the time the product is shipped to the customer 
for these reasons  purchase orders received are not necessarily reliable indicators of future sales 
results of operations fiscal vs 
fiscal net sales net sales for fiscal year was  a decrease of  or from the previous fiscal year net sales of  as a percentage of total net sales  sales to customers in the medical electronics  imaging  telecom and other market were as follows in thousands markets fiscal years ended march  medical electronics   imaging   telecom   others   net sales   overall demand for our products in fiscal was lower compared to fiscal however  sales in our telecom market showed a modest improvement over the prior year primarily as a result of the economic upturn in the semiconductor industry in the second half of fiscal sales to our telecom market increased compared to the prior fiscal year  primarily from our legacy isdn products and to a lesser extent from our optical to optical switcher arrays 
sales to the medical electronics market dropped compared to prior fiscal year due to a delay in production of certain newer high end platforms utilizing our chip scale package products 
the decrease in sales to our imaging market reflected softness in the consumer usage of el backlights 
however  we believe that there will be a recovery in our sales in this market in the coming fiscal year due to new design wins in new applications such as keypads  remote controls  and at certain watch manufacturers 
the rest of the markets we served remained stable in fiscal and are likely to experience a moderate sales growth in fiscal as improvements in global semiconductor economy continue 
in fiscal  we derived approximately of our net sales from customers outside the united states  primarily in asia and europe  compared to in fiscal dollar sales to international customers also increased approximately from  to  for the fiscal year ended march  and respectively 
these percentages have been adjusted to reflect a change in our aggregation of geographic sales information 
sales are now attributed to geographic area based on delivery location 
the increase in the percentage of international sales is attributed to increase in shipments to delivery locations in asia excluding japan while sales in the united states declined 
we believe that part of this shift reflects changes in our customers manufacturing trends with more customers increasing their production operations in asia 
additional discussion regarding our sales based on geographic area can be found in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
gross margin gross profit represents net sales less cost of sales 
our cost of sales includes the cost of wafer fabrication  cost associated with assembly  packaging  test  quality assurance and product yields  the cost of personnel  facilities  and equipment associated with manufacturing support and charges for excess inventory 
gross profit for fiscal year was  compared to  in fiscal year gross profit in fiscal includes a benefit of  which represents the release of provision for inventory previously written down and sold during the year compared to  in fiscal our gross profit as a percentage of net sales fluctuates  depending on product mix  manufacturing yields  utilization of manufacturing capacity  and average selling prices  among other factors 
our gross margin was for fiscal compared to in the prior fiscal year 
the gross margin improvement was primarily due to rigorous cost reduction measures and lower depreciation expenses 
in fiscal  we successfully qualified our in house ion implantation process that resulted in reductions in our outside service costs and favorably impacted our gross profit 
depreciation expense in fiscal was lower than fiscal due to declining capital spending in the last few years  thereby reducing the depreciable cost 
we have completed the upgrades to our fab and test operations  which we started in fiscal research and development research and development r d expenses include payroll and benefits  processing costs  and depreciation 
we also expense prototype wafers and mask sets related to new products as r d expenses until new products are released to production 
r d expenses were and of net sales in fiscal and  respectively 
dollar expenditures for research and development were  and  for fiscal and  respectively 
the net increase of  in r d expense for the current year was primarily due to an increase in costs related to new process and new product development offset by a reduction in payroll  software licensing costs and lower depreciation expenses 
we plan to continue this level of r d investments as a percent of net sales 
selling  general and administrative sg a sg a expenses consist primarily of employee related expenses  commissions to sales representatives  occupancy expenses including expenses associated with our regional sales offices  cost of advertising and publications  and outside services such as legal  auditing and tax services 
sg a expenses were and of net sales in fiscal and  respectively 
in absolute dollars  sg a expenses were  in fiscal compared to  for fiscal this  or increase in sg a was attributed to an increase in payroll and benefits expenses of  an increase in legal expenses of  an increase in occupancy cost of  an increase in bad debt expenses of  an increase in travel and entertainment expenses of  offset by a reduction in advertising and publication charges of  the increase in payroll and benefits expenses was attributed to the increase in compensation expense resulting primarily from the increase in valuation of plan assets for the company s supplemental employee retirement plan of  as well as an increase in headcount in our sales and marketing group 
we have expanded our sales efforts in the far east  which also caused an increase in travel and entertainment expenses during fiscal the increase in legal expenses year over year is due to a benefit from a reversal of a provision for legal expenses in fiscal following the favorable resolution of a claim initiated by a customer 
this reversal resulted in a benefit of  realized in fiscal year the increase in occupancy costs is attributed to an increase in facilities maintenance costs 
bad debt expenses in the prior year were favorably impacted by the collection of previously reserved accounts receivable of  the reduction in advertising expenses in fiscal was due to cost control measures 
interest income and other income  net interest income and other income  net for fiscal year was  compared to  in fiscal interest income interest income  which consists primarily of interest income from our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  was  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal the moderate increase in interest income in fiscal is due to larger average cash  cash equivalent and short term investment balance in the current periods compared to the same periods of the prior fiscal year 
other income  net other income  net of  for fiscal consisted primarily of an increase in fair market value of investments held by the company s supplemental employee retirement plan of  and licensing income of  for the comparable period in fiscal  other income  net  of  consisted of a gain on sale of a long term investment of  and an increase in the fair market value of investments held in the company s supplemental employee retirement plan of  licensing income of  offset by a loss from disposal of equipment of  and an impairment charge of  due to the uncertainty surrounding the recoverability of another long term investment 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes for fiscal is of income before provision for income taxes compared to in fiscal the company reduced its effective tax rate due to a higher proportion of its earnings attributed to its foreign based subsidiary  which is in a lower tax jurisdiction 
fiscal vs 
fiscal net sales we had net sales of  in fiscal  a decrease of from the previous fiscal year net sales of  overall semiconductor industry conditions were very weak during fiscal year  as were conditions in all of the markets that we serve  except the imaging market in which we increased our market share 
in fiscal  sales of our telecommunications products continued to be adversely affected by the telecommunications industry s lackluster infrastructure spending which reduced demand for our customers products 
this was offset in part by increased revenues for our products in the imaging market 
markets fiscal years ended march  medical electronics   imaging   telecom   others   net sales   the increase in sales in the imaging market is primarily due to the sales increase in the backlighting inverter ics  which gained market share in the phone applications market 
sales to rest of the markets declined primarily due to the adverse impact of the continuing downturn in the global semiconductor industry 
in fiscal  we derived approximately of our net sales from customers outside the united states  primarily in asia and europe  compared to in fiscal dollar sales to international customers also increased approximately from  to  in fiscal year  we changed our aggregation of geographic sales information 
sales are now attributed to geographic area based on delivery location  whereas  in prior years  sales were attributed by sales territory 
a sales territory is a designation for an area covered by a sales team 
under this new method  sales to customers outside the united states for fiscal were  or of total sales compared to  or of net sales in fiscal year additional discussion regarding our sales based on geographic area can be found in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
gross margin our gross margin as a percentage of net sales for fiscal was approximately compared to for fiscal year the drop in margin was the result of a slightly less favorable product sales mix  a charge for the write down of inventory  and continued low plant capacity utilization  partially offset by continued cost control 
research and development research and development r d expenses  which include payroll and benefits  processing costs and process transfer costs  were and of net sales in fiscal and  respectively 
dollar expenditures for research and development were  and  for fiscal and  respectively 
the net decrease of  in r d expense for fiscal was primarily attributed to a reduction in prototype processing costs of  as several new products were transferred to production status  reduction in software expenses of  reduction in mask tooling expenses of  and reduction in rent expenses of  offset by an increase in payroll and benefit expenses of  due to additional headcount 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses sg a  which include commissions  payroll and benefits  were and of net sales in fiscal and  respectively 
in fiscal  the selling  general and administrative expenses were  compared to  for fiscal the net increase of  was attributed to an increase of  in payroll and benefits due to additional headcount  an increase in advertising spending of  and an increase in commissions of  due to increased commissionable sales 
in addition  sg a expenses for the fiscal year were partially offset by benefits from the collection of previously reserved accounts receivable of  as compared with sg a expenses for fiscal which were partially offset by benefits from the collection of previously reserved accounts receivable of approximately  sg a expenses were favorably impacted by the reversal of a provision for legal expenses in fiscal of  following the favorable settlement of a claim initiated by a customer in fiscal related to a product returned 
interest income interest income  which consists primarily of interest income from our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  was  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal the decline in interest income in fiscal was mostly due to lower yields on cash deposit accounts as compared to the prior year 
other income  net other income  net of  for fiscal consists primarily of a gain on the sale of a long term investment of  gain from investment in short term securities of  and licensing income of  offset by a loss from disposal of equipment of  sublease expenses net of sublease income of  and an impairment charge of  due to the uncertainty surrounding the recoverability of an investment 
in fiscal  other income and expense  net of  consisted primarily of a gain on sale of long term investments of  licensing income realized of  fees charged to customers for returning products of  and sublease income net of sublease expenses of  provision for income taxes provision for income taxes for fiscal is of income before provision for income taxes compared to in fiscal the reduction of the effective tax rate was primarily due to a change in geographic mix of income 
financial condition overview as of march   the company s working capital was  an increase of  over march  working capital is defined as current assets less current liabilities 
the increase in working capital was mostly the result of cash generated by operations 
cash  cash equivalents and short term investment balance as of march  was  compared with  on march   and  on march  liquidity and capital resources our cash and cash equivalents increased  during fiscal to  from  at march  the increase in cash and cash equivalents during fiscal is due to cash flows from operating activities of  and cash flows from financing activities of  offset by cash used in investing activities of  current ratio  calculated as total current assets divided by total current liabilities  improved to at march   compared to at march  quick ratio  calculated as total current assets net of inventories divided by total current liabilities also improved to at march   compared to at march  our operating activities generated cash of   and  for fiscal   and  respectively 
net operating cash flows for fiscal was impacted by non cash charges for depreciation  non cash charges for provisions relating to inventory  doubtful accounts and sales returns and an increase in fair market value of short term investments categorized as trading securities 
the increase in short term investments categorized as trading securities  which consists entirely of assets held in the supplementat employee retirement plan serp  included contributions from employees net of withdrawals 
trade accounts receivable  net decreased or  to  at march  from  at march   due primarily to lower sales 
the average days of accounts receivable outstanding dso improved to days at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal as compared to days at the end of the comparable period in fiscal dso is calculated by multiplying the ratio of net trade accounts receivable to net sales at the end of each quarter to the total number of days within that period 
dso for fiscal was favorably impacted by our collection performance and payment terms offered 
we made improvements in our collection performance during fiscal year should we need to offer longer payment terms in the future due to competitive pressures  this could negatively affect our dso 
inventories decreased or  to  at march  from  at march  average days of sales in inventory remained the same at days at both fiscal years in comparison 
inventories consist of raw wafers and certain piece parts for assembly operations  work in process  and finished units 
we are continuing to take measures to reduce manufacturing cycle times and improve production planning efficiency 
however  increased process complexity and the strategic need to offer competitive lead times may result in an increase in inventory levels in the future 
net cash used in investing activities in fiscal was  compared to cash provided by investing activities of  in fiscal net cash used in investing activities for fiscal consisted of equipment purchases of  purchase of short term investments categorized as available for sale of  offset by proceeds from sale of short term investments of the same amount and proceeds from disposal of property and equipment of  for fiscal  cash was provided by sales of long term investments categorized as available for sale of  primarily offset by equipment purchases of  our financing activities consisted primarily of proceeds from employee and consultant exercises of stock options under our option plans and employee purchases of stock under our espp of  in fiscal  compared to  in fiscal we expect to spend approximately  for capital acquisitions during fiscal we believe that our existing balance of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  together with our cash flow from operations  will be sufficient to meet our liquidity and capital requirements through the end of fiscal we have agreed to defend certain customers  distributors  suppliers  and subcontractors against certain claims which third parties may assert that our products allegedly infringe certain of their intellectual property rights  including patents  trademarks  trade secrets  or copyrights 
we have also agreed to pay certain amounts of any resulting damage awards and we have the option to replace any infringing product with non infringing product 
the terms of these indemnification obligations are generally perpetual from the effective date of the agreement 
in certain cases  there are limits on and exceptions to our potential liability for indemnification relating to intellectual property infringement claims 
we cannot estimate the amount of potential future payments  if any  that we might be required to make as a result of these agreements 
to date  we have not paid any damage award or been required to defend any claim related to our indemnification obligations  and accordingly  we have not accrued any amounts for our indemnification obligations 
however  there can be no assurances that we will not have any financial exposure under those indemnification obligations 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have  or are reasonably likely to have  a current or future effect upon our financial condition  revenues  expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to our investors 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual cash obligations at march   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flow in future periods in thousands payment due by year contractual obligations total less than after year years years years operating lease obligations      purchase obligations   total contractual cash obligations      we lease facilities under non cancelable lease agreements expiring at various times through april  rental expense net of sublease for fiscal amounted to  to obtain favorable pricing and resource commitment  we commit to volume purchase to suppliers of our manufacturing materials 
recent accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no
