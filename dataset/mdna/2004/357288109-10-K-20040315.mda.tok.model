average interest earning assets increased to billion during  as compared to billion during the net interest income margin also increased to for from for the increase in volume is primarily a result of a significantly higher level of residential real estate loans  both in held for sale and portfolio  this higher level is due to significantly higher origination levels of these loans 
the margin for commercial real estate loans increased during due in part to the presence of interest rate floors in which the total of the variable base rate  such as six month libor  plus the related spread on a commercial real estate loan will not contractually drop below a certain absolute level on a significant number of the company s commercial real estate loans 
the higher margin contribution from the commercial real estate portfolio was partially offset by a compression in the margin for residential real estate loans 
the residential real estate loans are primarily comprised of loans held for sale which were predominately originated in or just before the quarterly periods presented  loans originated in had lower margins than in due to differing interest rate conditions

the net operating gain on sale amount does not include net interest income on residential real estate loans held for sale or any fair value adjustments on the company s residual interests in securitized loans 
while the provision for loan losses decreased to million for as compared to million for  primarily as a result of lower growth in the commercial real estate loan portfolio  the provision remained relatively high from a historical perspective 
the provision for loan losses represents the current period expense associated with maintaining an appropriate allowance for loan losses 
the loan loss provision for each period is dependent upon many factors  including loan growth  net charge offs  changes in the composition of the loan portfolio  delinquencies  assessment by management and regulators of the inherent risk in the portfolio  the value of the underlying collateral on classified loans and the general economic conditions in the commercial real estate markets the company lends in 
during  the allowance for loan losses increased as a percentage of the commercial real estate loans outstanding 
this increase is indicative of higher a charge off ratio for  for and for  higher non performing and classified asset levels  higher levels of loans past due days or more and as of december  and  respectively  increased levels of construction lending in the portfolio for which the company has limited historical loss patterns to utilize in its evaluation  continued historically high levels of restructured loans  continued uncertainty in certain markets and property types the company has lent in or on  and a continuation of uncertain economic conditions on a national scale 
periodic fluctuations in the provision for loan losses and the allowance for loan losses result from management s on going assessment of their adequacy 
the company s net loans receivable excluding loans held for sale  before the allowance for loan losses  were approximately billion at december   as compared to billion at december  
table of contents the company s residential real estate loans held for sale have increased from billion at december  to billion at december   this increase is reflective of a significant increase in loan production volume during  residential real estate loan originations totaled billion as compared to billion for non interest expense increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   an increase of approximately 
the primary driver of this increase over the prior year was the additional compensation and related organizational expenses incurred to support the substantial increase in residential real estate loan origination volume 
additional expense also resulted due to the company providing the mortgage servicing for the two loan securitizations entered into during the year  a higher level of residential real estate loans held for sale and portfolio  and a higher level of loans serviced on an interim basis for other financial institutions

the net operating gain on sale amount does not include net interest income on residential real estate loans held for sale or any fair value adjustments on the company s residual interests in securitized loans 
the provision for loan losses increased to million for as compared to million for  this increase is primarily reflective of an increase in the loan portfolio outstanding excluding loans held for sale from billion at december  to billion at december   but is primarily due to the company incurring increased net loan charge offs and non accrual loans during  and increasing its allowance for loan losses in response to its evaluation of expected  and often uncertain  future trends in general economic conditions and their impact upon the commercial real estate market in particular 
non interest expense increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   an increase of approximately 
this increase was due primarily to the compensation expense related to the additional staff required to support the increase in residential real estate loan originations over the prior year 
during  the company extinguished million in principal amount of its senior notes due  and million in principal amount at maturity of its lyons  with a pre tax gain of million

the unallocated corporate interest and other expense loss before taxes for the year ended december   was million as compared to million for the year ended december  while interest

the effective tax rates for both periods differ from the federal enacted tax rate of primarily due to various state income tax provisions within the company s financial services operation 
the company  based upon the results of its year end actuarial evaluations which reflected adverse loss development  determined that the financial position of its discontinued insurance operations had experienced significant deterioration 
as a result  the company determined that a recovery of its investment in its discontinued insurance operations was no longer probable and that a write down of the entire investment was warranted 
the total impairment charge taken in the fourth quarter was million before taxes and was comprised of a million net investment in the company s discontinued insurance operations and a loss accrual of million for the net present value of potential future cash contributions to fic 
the million loss resulted in an after tax charge of million which was reported separate from net income from continuing operations

the level of non performing assets fluctuates and specific loans can have a material impact upon the total 
as of december   non performing commercial real estate loans and reo were comprised of non accrual loans and nine reo properties  as compared to non accrual commercial real estate loans and four reo properties at december  and non accrual commercial real estate loans and three reo properties at december  consideration must be given that  due to the secured nature of the company s loans and the presence of larger balance loans  the classification  and the timing thereof  of an individual loan as non performing or reo can have a significant impact upon the level of total non performing assets  without necessarily a commensurate increase in loss exposure 
as of december   non accrual residential real estate loans including loans held for sale and reo had slightly increased to million from million at december  and decreased from million at december  the decrease in non accrual loans in and from the level  is primarily the result of a concerted and ongoing effort by the

the provision for loan losses in decreased to million  as compared to million in and million in the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans receivable  increased to as of december   as compared to and at december  and  respectively 
the ratio of net charge offs to average total loans receivable decreased in from to from in and in the decrease in the ratio for as compared to is primarily a result of the increase in the average loan portfolio excluding loans held for sale for the increase in the ratio for as compared to is primarily a result of increased commercial real estate loan net charge offs  as well as  to a lesser degree  increased syndicated commercial loan net charge offs 
the net charge off ratio for commercial real estate loans for increased to as compared to for and for discontinued insurance operations the property and casualty insurance operation  which was primarily represented by the underwriting of workers compensation insurance policies  was classified as discontinued during the fourth quarter of the intention at that time was to allow the liabilities primarily loss and loss adjustment expense reserves related to the discontinued insurance business to run off and  as a result  the property and casualty insurance operation was accounted for as a discontinued operation using the liquidation basis of accounting 
accordingly  the company s operating results for and prior periods were restated to reflect reporting in this manner for all periods presented 
in july  fremont entered into the agreement with the doi that would allow fic  with the oversight of the doi  to self administer the run off its operations by paying claims and operating expenses in the ordinary course of business and also preserve the company s net operating loss carryforwards attributable to fic 
the agreement also obligated fremont to make certain additional cash contributions to fic 
further  as a result of the restrictions in the agreement with the doi  the additional adverse loss development  and other actions taken by the doi during the fourth quarter of  including placing further restrictions on the fic s ability to direct the activities of the run off of the discontinued insurance operations  the company no longer had effective control of these operations and its activities were done at the consent and under the direction of the doi 
accordingly  the assets and liabilities of the discontinued insurance operations as of december  were removed from the consolidated balance sheets of the company 
the insurance commissioner of the state of california sought  and was granted  an order of conservation over fic by the superior court of the state of california for the county of los angeles on june  the conservation order incorporates the agreement and also provides that nothing in the order is intended to modify any of the provisions of the agreement

for additional detail on the discontinuance of the property and casualty insurance operation see note q of notes to consolidated financial statements 
market risk the company is subject to market risk resulting primarily from fluctuations in interest rates arising from balance sheet financial instruments such as investments  loans and debt 
changes in interest rates can affect loan interest income  gains on the sale of residential real estate loans  interest expense  loan origination volume  net investment income  and total stockholders equity 
the level of gain on the sale of residential real estate loans is highly dependent upon the level of loan origination volume and the net premium paid by the purchasers of such loans 
both the volume and net premium  in turn  are highly dependent upon changes in  and the level of  interest rates and other economic factors 
the company may experience a decrease in the amount of net gain it realizes should significant interest rate increases occur or if other economic factors have a negative impact on the value and volume of the loans the company originates 
the objective of the asset and liability management activities is to provide the highest level of net interest and investment income and to seek cost effective sources of capital  while maintaining acceptable levels of interest rate and liquidity risk 
there is no exposure to foreign currency or commodity price risk 
the company is subject to interest rate risk resulting from differences between the rates on  and repricing characteristics of  interest earning loans receivable and loans held for sale and the rates on  and repricing characteristics of  interest bearing liabilities used to finance its loans such as deposits and debt 
interest rate gaps may arise when assets are funded with liabilities having different repricing intervals or different market indices to which the instruments interest rate is tied and to this degree earnings will be sensitive to interest rate changes 
additionally  interest rate gaps could develop between the market rate and the interest rate on loans in the financial services loan portfolio  which could result in borrowers prepaying their loan obligations 
while the company attempts to match the characteristics of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities to minimize the effect of fluctuations in interest rates  it does not currently utilize derivative financial instruments to a significant extent to meet these objectives 
any utilization of derivatives by the company are for the purpose of reducing the exposure to interest rate risk  not to speculate on the direction of market interest rates 
for the company s financial instruments  the expected maturity date does not necessarily reflect the net market risk exposure because certain instruments are subject to interest rate changes before expected maturity 
with respect to the company s pipeline of residential real estate loans held for sale  the company attempts to minimize its interest rate risk exposure through forward loan sale commitments  these commitments do not meet the definition of a derivative under generally accepted accounting principles and  accordingly  they are not recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
the company is reliant upon the secondary mortgage market for execution of its whole loan sales and securitizations of residential real estate loans 
while the company strives to maintain adequate levels of liquidity to withstand certain disruptions in the secondary mortgage market  a significant disruption could adversely impact the company s ability to fund  sell  securitize or finance its residential real estate loan origination volume  leading to reduced gains on sale and a corresponding decrease in revenue and earnings 
a deterioration in performance of the residential real estate loans after being sold in whole loan sales and securitizations could adversely impact the availability and pricing of such future transactions

the last of the net operating loss carryforwards were fully utilized during and only current operating losses at fremont will offset taxable income generated by fil  as a result  beginning in  fremont is expected to pay most of the federal income taxes it receives from fil to the federal taxing authorities 
there exist certain california franchise tax matters pending resolution  of which fremont is not yet able to make a determination of their ultimate liability  but does not believe that the actual outcomes of these matters will adversely impact its liquidity 
it is expected that the final resolution of these matters will take several years

off balance sheet activities the company in began again to securitize its residential real estate loans  the company had not done so since securitization is a process of transforming the loans into securities  which are sold to investors 
the loans are sold to a qualifying special purpose entity a qspe which is legally isolated from the company 
the qspe  in turn  issues interest bearing securities  commonly known as asset backed securities  that are secured by the future cash flows to be derived from the sold loans 
the qspe uses the proceeds from the issuance of the securities to pay the purchase price of the sold loans 
the company does not utilize unconsolidated special purpose entities as a mechanism to remove non performing assets from the consolidated balance sheets 
securitization is used by the company to provide an additional source of liquidity 
the qspes are not consolidated into the company s financial statements since they meet the criteria established by sfas no 
 accounting for the transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities 
in general  those criteria require the qspe to be isolated and distinct from the transferor the company  be limited to permitted activities  and have defined limits on the assets it can hold and the permitted sales  exchanges or distributions of its assets 
during  the company securitized billion in residential real estate loans 
the investors and the qspes do not have any recourse to the company if the cash flows generated by the sold loans are inadequate to service the securities issued by the qspes 
at the close of each securitization  the company removes from its balance sheet the carrying value of the loans sold and adds to its balance sheet the estimated fair value of the assets obtained in consideration for the loans which generally include the cash received net of transaction expenses  retained junior class securities referred to as residual interests and mortgage servicing rights

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates general the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  which are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
gain on whole loan sales and securitizations the company recognizes net gains or losses on whole loan sales and securitizations of its residential real estate loans at the date of settlement and when the company has transferred control over the loans to either a securitization transaction or to a third party purchaser 
the amount of gain or loss for whole loan sales is based upon the difference between the net cash received for the loans and the allocated carrying value of the loans 
the company sells its whole loans on a servicing released basis and the net cash received includes a premium for the mortgage servicing rights 
in a securitization transaction  the company retains the mortgage servicing rights and a gain is recognized to the extent that the net selling price based upon the allocated fair values of the assets obtained at the date of transfer exceeds the carrying value of the loans sold 
the company structures each securitization transaction to meet the sale requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities and  as a result  at the closing of each securitization  the company removes from its balance sheet the carrying value of the loans held for sale and adds to its balance sheet the estimated fair value of the assets obtained from the sale of loans through the securitization transaction which generally include the cash received net of transaction expenses  retained junior class interests residual interests in securitized loans  and mortgage servicing rights 
the carrying value of the loans sold generally is loan principal balance plus the direct costs of origination  less the net amount of fees received from the borrower 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level deemed appropriate by management to adequately provide for known and probable losses and inherent risks in the loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses in the consolidated statement of operations and reduced by charge offs of loan balances related to specific loans 
the company utilizes a systematic methodology for determining an appropriate allowance for loan losses 
management s methodology for evaluating the adequacy of the allowance encompasses a variety of risk assumptions  both quantitative and qualitative  and the process includes a periodic loan by loan review of loans that are individually evaluated for impairment as well as detailed reviews of other loans  either individually or in pools 
quantitative factors include historical loss experience by property type and geographic market  delinquency trends  collateral values  specific problem loans  trends in problem and potential problem loans  and other relevant factors 
qualitative factors include prevailing and anticipated economic trends regionally  nationally and by industry  trends in volume  size and terms of loans  changes in risk selection and underwriting standards  loan concentrations geographic and industry  and other relevant factors 
while this methodology utilizes historical and other objective information deemed to warrant recognition in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance  the adequacy of the allowance is subject to variation as conditions change 

table of contents income taxes the company currently has significant deferred tax assets  which are subject to periodic recoverability assessments 
realization of the deferred tax assets is in part dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences become deductible 
the gain inherent in the company s loans held for sale has been recognized into taxable income in periods prior to being recognized into gaap income 
therefore  when the loans held for sale are ultimately sold  there will be no tax paid on the gain per gaap since the taxable gain was recognized in a previous period 
deferred tax assets relating to the allowance for loan losses are dependent on future taxable income to offset the deductions which are expected to arise when the loans relating to the allowance are ultimately charged off 
management s judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions  loan loss experience  and other factors 
these changes  if any  may require possible material adjustments to these deferred tax asset balances
