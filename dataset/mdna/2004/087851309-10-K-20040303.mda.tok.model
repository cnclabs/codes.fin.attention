item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general our business consists principally of providing healthcare services  including the operation of nursing facilities  assisted living centers  hospice and home care centers  outpatient clinics and rehabilitation therapy services 
we are one of the largest operators of nursing facilities in the united states 
as of december   we operated nursing facilities with a total of  licensed beds 
our nursing facilities are located in states and the district of columbia and range in capacity from to licensed beds 
as of december   we also operated assisted living centers containing units  hospice and home care centers  and outpatient clinics 
our operations also include rehabilitation therapy services in states and the district of columbia 
operations and services our operations are currently organized into three primary operating segments nursing facilities  aegis and home care 
nursing facilities 
our nursing facilities operations provide long term healthcare and rehabilitation services through the operation of skilled nursing facilities and assisted living centers and accounted for approximately  and of our revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our facilities provide residents with routine long term care services  including daily nursing  dietary  social and recreational services and a full range of pharmacy services and medical supplies 
our skilled nursing staff also provides complex and intensive medical services to residents with higher acuity needs outside the traditional acute care hospital setting 
we have designed our assisted living centers to provide residents with a greater degree of independence while still offering routine services and  if required  limited medical care 
aegis 
our aegis segment provides rehabilitation therapy services under contract to our nursing facilities  as well as third party nursing facilities  and accounted for approximately  and of our revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
aegis offers occupational  physical and speech therapy services designed to maximize function and independence  assist in recovery from medical conditions and compensate for remaining disabilities 
home care 
our home care operations  which accounted for approximately of our revenues for each of the years ended december   and  primarily provide hospice services within our nursing facilities  in facilities operated by other healthcare providers and in patients homes 
our hospice services include palliative care for terminally ill patients  as well as pastoral  counseling and bereavement services for the families of hospice patients 
governmental regulation we are subject to extensive regulation by federal  state and local agencies 
each of our facilities must comply with regulations regarding staffing levels  patient care standards  occupational health and safety  patient confidentiality  billing and reimbursement  as well as environmental and biological hazards  among others 
additionally  government agencies have steadily increased their enforcement activity in this industry over the past several years  particularly with respect to large for profit  multi facility providers like us 
this regulatory environment may force us to expend considerable resources to ensure compliance and respond to inspections  investigations or other enforcement actions 
we believe the government will continue aggressive enforcement in the future 
in the ordinary course of business  we periodically receive notices of deficiencies for allegations of failure to comply with various regulatory requirements 
we review all such notices and believe we take timely and appropriate corrective action 
in most cases  the facility and the government will agree upon steps to be taken to bring the facility into compliance with regulatory requirements 
in some cases or upon repeat violations  the government may take a number of adverse actions against the facility or us  including imposition of fines

see item business 
critical accounting policies the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the accounting policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements because their application requires significant judgment and reliance on estimations of matters that are inherently uncertain 
certain risks related to these critical accounting policies are described in the following paragraphs 
revenue recognition  accounts receivable and allowances for doubtful accounts our revenues are derived primarily from providing long term healthcare services 
approximately of our current revenues is derived from federal and state healthcare programs primarily medicare and medicaid 
as discussed more fully in item note  we record revenues when services are provided at standard charges adjusted to amounts estimated to be received under governmental programs or other third party contractual arrangements based on contractual terms and historical experience 
all providers participating in the medicare and medicaid programs are required to meet certain financial cost reporting requirements 
federal and state regulations generally require the submission of annual cost reports covering revenues  costs and expenses associated with the services provided to medicare beneficiaries and medicaid recipients 
annual cost reports are subject to routine audits and retroactive adjustments 
these audits often require several years to reach the final determination of amounts due to  or by  us under these programs 
as adjustments to recorded revenues become known or as cost reporting years are no longer subject to audits  reviews or investigations  the amounts of our revenues and receivables are revised 
our revenues are reported at their estimated net realizable amounts  and we believe adequate provision has been made to reflect any adjustments that could result from audits of cost reports 
however  due to the complexity of the laws and regulations governing the medicare and medicaid programs  there is at least a possibility that recorded estimates will change by a material amount in the near term 
changes in estimates related to third party receivables resulted in an increase in revenues of approximately million and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  and a decrease in revenues of approximately million for the year ended december  compliance with laws and regulations governing the medicare and medicaid programs is subject to government review and interpretation  as well as significant regulatory action including fines  penalties  and possible exclusion from the medicare and medicaid programs 
in addition  under the medicare program  if the federal government makes a formal demand for reimbursement  even related to contested items  payment must be made for those items before the provider is given an opportunity to appeal and resolve the issue 
we record bad debt expense monthly as a percentage of revenue reflecting our historical experience 
each quarter we adjust the allowance for doubtful accounts according to the aging and payor mix of the receivables 
these adjustments are based on our weighted average collection experience by payor type  and recognize the relative risk depending on the source of the expected payment 
private pay accounts usually represent our highest collectibility risk 
in addition  specific accounts that are determined to be uncollectible due to bankruptcy  insufficient documentation  lack of third party coverage or financial resources and the like are fully reserved when such determinations are made 
we write off uncollectible accounts receivable after all collection efforts have been exhausted and we determine they will not be collected 
if circumstances change including  but not limited to economic downturn  higher than expected defaults or denials  reduced collections  and changes in our payor mix  our estimates of the recoverability of our receivables could be reduced by a material amount 
our provisions for bad debts represented  and of revenues from continuing operations for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our allowance for doubtful accounts 
table of contents represented approximately and of patient accounts receivable at december  and  respectively 
our allowance for doubtful accounts represented and of accounts over days old as of december  and  respectively 
accounts receivable for our nursing facilities segment have continued to decline in  our aging of receivables has improved and our cash collections continue to be in line with  or ahead of  our generated revenues 
these factors have led to a decrease in our provision for bad debts and a reduction in our allowance for doubtful accounts in we believe adequate provision has been made for receivables that may prove to be uncollectible 
patient care liability and other insurance risks general and professional liability costs for the long term healthcare industry have become increasingly expensive and difficult to estimate 
in addition  insurance coverage for patient care liability and certain other risks  for nursing facilities specifically and companies in general  has become increasingly difficult to obtain 
when obtained  insurance carriers are often requiring companies to significantly increase their liability retention levels and pay substantially higher premiums for reduced terms of coverage 
the majority of our workers compensation and auto liability risks are insured through loss sensitive insurance policies with affiliated and unaffiliated insurance companies 
for our general and professional liabilities  we are responsible for the first dollar of each claim  up to a self insurance limit determined by the individual policies  subject to aggregate limits in certain prior policy years 
we have purchased insurance for workers compensation  property  casualty and other risks from numerous insurance companies 
in many cases  the policies provide coverage for events occurring in specific time frames that may only be determined in later years 
we evaluate our purchased insurance coverage for risk transfer and believe our occurrence based insurance policies have sufficiently transferred the risk of loss to the insurance carriers we utilize 
as a result  we do not recognize a liability in our consolidated financial statements for amounts covered by insurance 
we exercise care in selecting companies from which we purchase insurance  including review of published ratings by recognized rating agencies  advice from national brokers and consultants and review of trade information sources 
there exists a risk that any of these insurance companies may become insolvent and unable to fulfill their obligation to defend  pay or reimburse us when that obligation becomes due 
in several prior policy years  losses exceed our self insurance aggregate limits 
for claims relating to these years  our insurers have assumed a more significant role in handling the claims or related obligations and settlements 
as a result  it is more difficult to estimate potential losses in those years 
however  we expect any losses in those years to be covered by our insurers 
although we believe the companies we have purchased insurance from are solvent  in light of the dramatic changes occurring in the insurance industry in recent years  we cannot assure you that they will remain solvent and able to fulfill their obligations 
our liabilities for general  professional and workers compensation risks are estimated by our independent actuaries twice a year using the most recent trends of claims  settlements and other relevant data 
on an undiscounted basis  these liabilities totaled million at december  on our financial statements  these liabilities are discounted at to their present value using actuarially determined loss payment timing patterns 
the discount rate is based upon our best estimate of our incremental borrowing rate that would be required to fund these liabilities with uncollateralized debt 
a reduction in the discount rate by one half of a percentage point would have resulted in an additional pre tax charge of million for the year ended december  based on information provided by our independent actuaries  we estimate our range of discounted exposure for these liabilities to be million to million 
at december   our recorded reserves for these liabilities totaled million 
we believe adequate provision has been made in the financial statements for liabilities that may arise out of patient care and other services 
asset impairments we recorded pre tax asset impairment charges of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we also recorded impairments of goodwill of million in as the cumulative effect of an accounting change in accordance with statement of 
table of contents financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

we evaluate our long lived assets for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 

these indicators of impairment can include  but are not limited to  the following a history of operating losses  with expected future losses  changes in the regulatory environment affecting reimbursement  decreases in cash flows or cash flow deficiencies  changes in the way an asset is used in the business  and commitment to a plan to sell or otherwise dispose of an asset 
during  a history of operating losses  with expected future losses  and cash flow deficiencies led to impairments on three facilities in our nursing facilities segment 
during  changes in the regulatory environment affecting medicare reimbursement led to a long lived asset impairment analysis on our nursing facilities segment 
during  continuing operating losses in several of our lines of business  including certain outpatient clinics  our managed care contracting entity  certain home care businesses and a few of our nursing facilities  led to impairment analyses on these assets 
these impairment analyses included estimating the undiscounted cash flows to be generated by each clinic  unit  facility or property  primarily over the remaining life of the primary asset  and reducing the carrying value of the asset to the estimated fair value when the total estimated undiscounted cash flows was less than the carrying value of the clinic  unit  facility or property 
in estimating the undiscounted cash flows for our nursing facilities  we primarily used our internally prepared budgets and forecast information  with certain probability adjustments  including  but not limited to  the following items medicare and medicaid funding  overhead costs  capital expenditures  and patient care liability costs 
in order to estimate the fair values of the nursing facilities  we used a discounted cash flow approach  supplemented by public resource information on valuations of nursing facility sales transactions by region of the country 
where the estimated undiscounted cash flows were negative  we estimated the fair values based on discounted public resource information  sales values or estimated salvage value 
for other lines of business that lack significant property investments  we discounted the next five years of expected cash flows 
a substantial decline in the estimated future cash flows for these facilities or businesses could materially change the estimated fair values of these assets  possibly resulting in an additional impairment 
in july  sfas no 
was issued  which established new rules on the accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets 
in accordance with this standard  we performed the initial screening for potential impairments of our indefinite lived intangible assets by reporting unit as of january  we determined the estimated fair values of each reporting unit using discounted cash flow analyses  along with independent source data related to recent transactions 
based on this determination  we identified potential goodwill impairments at our former matrix segment and at care focus  a former reporting unit within our home care segment 
we engaged a qualified  independent valuation group to determine the estimated fair values of each of these reporting units 
their analysis was completed in the fourth quarter of  and led to the recording of goodwill impairment charges as the cumulative effect of an accounting change of million as of january   including million for matrix and million for care focus 
the outpatient therapy clinic operations and the managed care network of matrix were sold during january the care focus unit was sold in june based on our annual assessments of all reporting units as of october  and  no additional impairments of goodwill were identified 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements at december   we had an off balance sheet financing arrangement of million of medium term notes medium term notes 
these notes are obligations of beverly funding corporation bfc  a non consolidated bankruptcy remote  qualifying special purpose entity 
bfc s sole purpose is to acquire  own  hold  and otherwise administer certain patient accounts receivable originated and sold to it by certain of our operating subsidiaries and to issue beneficial interests in those receivables 
under the terms of the arrangement  certain of our wholly owned operating subsidiaries groups of nursing facilities within each state that we operate  which are separate legal entities  sell medicaid and veterans administration patient accounts receivable to beverly health and rehabilitation services  inc bhrs  our wholly owned operating subsidiary 
bfc then purchases these receivables under a revolving sales structure from bhrs at a discount of 
bfc receives its funding from the issuance of debt to third party investors  and investments made in bfc by us 
at december  and  bfc held million and million  respectively  of net patient accounts receivable 
the decrease in net patient accounts receivable held by bfc in from relates to our strategic dispositions of nursing facilities and the resulting reduction in new patient accounts receivable available for bfc to purchase 
in addition to net patient accounts receivable  bfc also had million of cash at december  the medium term notes were issued in june and july to third party investors 
the proceeds were used to redeem million of then outstanding medium term notes issued by bfc in that were nearing maturity and to purchase additional eligible receivables from bhrs 
in addition  we increased our investment in bfc  allowing bfc to purchase additional eligible receivables to serve as excess collateral for the new medium term notes 
under the terms of the arrangement  bfc is required to maintain receivables and or cash in excess of the outstanding balance of the medium term notes based on a calculated formula included in the master sale and servicing agreement among bhrs  bfc and beverly enterprises  inc the medium term notes mature in  however  according to the provisions of the notes  principal payments on these obligations are calculated based on quarterly collections of the underlying receivables  and are required to begin during the second quarter of based on current collection patterns  we expect the medium term notes will be paid off by the third quarter of bhrs recognizes a loss at the time the receivables are sold to bfc equal to the discount and this loss is included in other operating and administrative costs and expenses and in net cash provided by operating activities in our consolidated financial statements 
bhrs provides invoicing and collection services related to the purchased receivables for a market based servicing fee 
neither the loss on sale of receivables nor the servicing fee revenue is material to the company s results of operations or cash flows 
prior to june  bfc s assets  liabilities and operating results were consolidated with us 
however  in june in connection with the redemption of previously issued medium term notes  and issuance of the medium term notes in june and july  the master sale and servicing agreement was amended so that bfc met the definition of a qualifying special purpose entity as defined in statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
specifically  bfc was no longer permitted to hold or purchase receivables that originated prior to january  a condition that prevented it from becoming a qualifying special purpose entity prior to june 
we continually evaluate the organizational structure and operations of bfc to ensure that it remains legally isolated from us and each of our operating subsidiaries and that it maintains its status as a qualifying special purpose entity and  thereby  remains deconsolidated 
our investment in bfc of million at december   has been recorded as a current asset in our consolidated balance sheet 
the investment is recorded at its estimated fair value and is subject to periodic review for other than temporary impairment 
the fair value is determined by discounting the expected future cash flows of the underlying receivables purchased and held by bfc at discount rates that reflect the projected payment terms and the credit risk of the receivables 
we regularly update our fair value analysis for changes in timing and amount of expected future collections of the receivables 
the carrying value of our investment is written down when the analysis indicates that the investment is other than temporarily impaired 
our total investments in bfc have been adjusted from their initial value of million due to cumulative credit losses 
table of contents incurred by bfc associated with the purchased receivables since june we believe the carrying value of our asset will be fully realized upon the maturity and repayment of the medium term notes and collection of the excess receivables 
we monitor this off balance sheet obligation throughout the year and believe the obligation and any related assets should not be included in our consolidated financial statements under current generally accepted accounting principles 
as of december   we have off balance sheet debt guarantees of million that primarily arose from our sales of nursing facilities 
we also guarantee certain third party operating leases 
those guarantees arose from our dispositions of leased facilities  and the underlying leases have million of minimum rental commitments remaining through the initial lease terms  with the latest termination date being february in accordance with the fasb s interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  we have recorded approximately  included in other accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet  as the estimated fair value of guarantees 
operating results reclassification results of operations for the years ended december  and reflect asset dispositions during as discontinued operations 
the following discussions of compared to and compared to reflect this reclassification 
compared to results of operations continuing operations we reported net income from continuing operations for the year ended december  of million  compared to a net loss from continuing operations of million for the year ended december  net income from continuing operations for included special pre tax charges totaling million  primarily including million for asset impairments  primarily related to three nursing facilities  million for workforce reductions see below  million for exit costs associated with our divestiture strategy  net of million reversal of previously recorded exit costs and  primarily resulting from the settlement of a previously impaired asset above carrying value  and the reversal of  of costs originally accrued for the california investigation settlement 
the million for workforce reductions primarily relates to associates who were notified during that their positions would be eliminated  and included the following million of cash expenses  million of which was paid during the year ended december   and non cash expenses of approximately  related to the issuance of  shares under our stock grant plan the stock grant plan  less approximately  due to the cancellation of restricted stock

see compared to costs related to early extinguishments of debt during the fourth quarter of  we entered into a million senior credit facility and issued million of convertible notes 
the net proceeds from these transactions were used to pay off our senior notes and certain mortgages  bonds and other debt obligations 
in conjunction with these transactions  we wrote off million of deferred financing costs related to our former credit facility  the senior notes and the other debt obligations 
we also paid a prepayment premium of million related to the early extinguishment of the senior notes 
gain on sale of equity investment during the fourth quarter of  we sold all of our holdings in a publicly traded equity security that was acquired in this investment had been accounted for as available for sale  with all changes in fair value being recorded as comprehensive income 
in conjunction with the sale of the investment  we reversed the accumulated comprehensive income and recognized a pre tax gain of million 
revenues we reported revenues of  million during the year ended december   compared to  million for the same period in approximately and of our revenues for each of the years ended december  and  respectively  were derived from services provided by our nursing facilities segment 
the increase in revenues of million for the year ended december   as compared to the same period in  is due to the following an increase of million from facilities we operated during each of the years ended december  and same facility operations  an increase of million from growth in aegis external therapy business  
table of contents an increase of million due to a facility acquisition  the opening of a newly constructed facility and three hospice and home care centers  and two start up businesses  net of a decrease of million due to dispositions during not reported as discontinued operations 
the increase in revenues of million from same facility operations for the year ended december   as compared to the same period in  was primarily due to the following million due to an increase in medicaid and private payment rates  million due to a positive shift in our patient mix primarily from private to medicare  million adjustment related to favorable prior year cost report settlements  million due to an increase in average daily census in our home care segment  partially offset by a decrease of million in medicare payment rates 
effective october   certain medicare add on payments were eliminated when the federal government did not pass legislation to restore the funding 
the impact of these eliminations was partially offset by a increase in medicare rates effective october   a decrease of million due to a decline in same facility census  and million due to a decrease in various other items 
costs and expenses we reported costs and expenses of  million during the year ended december   compared to  million for the same period in excluding special pre tax charges of million in and million in  discussed above  our costs and expenses increased million  consisting of the following an increase of million in same facility operations  an increase of million due to a facility acquisition  and the opening of a newly constructed facility and three hospice and home care centers and two start up businesses  partially offset by a decrease of million due to dispositions during not reported as discontinued operations 
the increase in costs and expenses of million from same facility operations for the year ended december   as compared to the same period in  was due primarily to the following million of additional wages and related expenses primarily due to an increase in our weighted average wage rate  an increase in nursing hours per patient day and an increase in associate incentives  million increase in our provision for insurance and related items  as discussed below  million due to an increase in contracted services  primarily due to outsourcing certain housekeeping  laundry and dietary services in our nursing facilities segment  partially offset by an million decrease in our provision for reserves on accounts and notes receivable due to improvements in the timing and amount of collections  as well as the collection of certain accounts that had previously been fully reserved  and million decrease in depreciation and amortization expense due to the impact of asset impairments recorded in the fourth quarter of our provision for insurance and related items for continuing operations increased during  as compared to  primarily due to the following an increase in fixed premiums and related costs for general and professional liability  directors and officers insurance and workers compensation  
table of contents accruals for patient care liability costs were low due to aggregate limits on our insurance policies in place for a portion of such aggregate limits were reached during due to the sale of our florida facilities  and an increase in the actuarial projection of patient care liability claims 
we adjust our accruals for prior policy year patient care and workers compensation liabilities and our accrual of expected losses for the current year based primarily on actuarial studies conducted twice per year 
adjustments to premiums and other costs are recorded as incurred 
income taxes we recorded a provision for income taxes of million for the year ended december   including million from continuing operations and million from discontinued operations  primarily related to state income taxes 
we decreased our valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets by million during to million as of december  this valuation allowance is required under the guidance of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 
due to our historical operating performance and our reported cumulative net losses 
our realization of the deferred tax benefits  primarily associated with our net operating losses  is dependent upon our achieving sufficient future pre tax income 
under federal income tax regulations  we have up to years to generate sufficient taxable income to realize the deferred benefits 
however  given the size of our pre tax losses in prior years  a valuation allowance was considered to be appropriate under the more stringent accounting standards for the realization of these deferred tax benefits  which is contingent upon future income in the near term 
at december   for income tax purposes  we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of million which expire in years through  general business tax credit carryforwards of million which expire in years through  and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards of million which do not expire 
future tax benefits associated with these carryforwards are not recorded in our and consolidated financial statements as a result of the valuation allowance recorded in results of operations discontinued operations the results of operations of disposed facilities  clinics and other assets during the year ended december   as well as the results of operations of held for sale assets  have been reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented in the consolidated statements of operations

we recognized net gains on sales of million in discontinued operations related to divestitures of nursing facilities and seven assisted living centers during the year ended december  during  we recognized asset impairment charges on of these divested facilities  amounting to million 
these impairments were precipitated by an estimated decline in future cash flows  primarily associated with medicare funding reductions

we recorded a special pre tax charge of million during for workforce reductions which were primarily the result of a continuing operational reorganization required to support the implementation of our three year strategic plan 
during  we notified employees that their positions would be eliminated 
the charge included the following million of cash expenses  million and million of which was paid during the years ended december  and  respectively  and non cash expenses of approximately  related to the issuance of  shares under our stock grant plan

we estimated the annual costs savings of this operational reorganization to be approximately million 
much of this savings was realized in  since the majority of the workforce reductions took place in the first quarter 
these estimated savings are net of the additional costs we incurred to increase the operations and clinical staff at the facility and district level 
approximately  of these workforce reduction charges in were reversed during on february   we made a settlement offer to the federal government to resolve open reimbursement issues under the former cost reimbursement system for medicare 
for accounting purposes  this settlement offer was required to be recorded in our operating results for the year ended december   and resulted in a pre tax charge of million which is included in the caption special charges and adjustment related to settlements of federal government investigations 
this charge included a million cash settlement and the write off of million of related cost report receivables  offset by a million reserve established in for related issues 
this matter was settled with cms in the fourth quarter of  and required no increase in accruals previously recorded

with respect to our goodwill and intangible assets  sfas no 
was effective for us beginning january  for  our goodwill and operating rights amortization was million and  respectively  net of income taxes  or per share diluted 
we completed the impairment assessment of our indefinite lived intangible assets  other than goodwill  during the first quarter of  with no impairment identified 
sfas no 
described a two step process for testing goodwill for impairment 
the first step is a screen for potential impairment  while the second step measures the amount of the impairment  if any 
upon completion of the first step of the goodwill impairment test for all of our reporting units  results indicated that goodwill appeared to be impaired for our former matrix and home care services care focus reporting units 
we subjected the goodwill at these reporting units to step two under sfas no 

table of contents we engaged a qualified  independent third party to determine the estimated fair value of these two reporting units 
their valuation was completed during the fourth quarter of  and the resulting impairment losses amounted to million for matrix and million for home care services care focus 
as required by sfas no 
 these impairment losses were recorded in the consolidated statement of operations as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting for goodwill as of january  liquidity and capital resources at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents 
we anticipate million of this cash balance  while not legally restricted  will be utilized primarily to fund certain general and professional liabilities and workers compensation claims and expenses 
at december   we had million of unused commitments under our million revolving credit facility  with utilization being for standby letters of credit primarily in support of certain insurance programs  security deposits  and debt or guaranteed debt obligations 
at december   we had positive working capital of million reflected on our consolidated balance sheet 
our cash flows consisted of the following for the years ended december in thousands net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by used for investing activities net cash used for financing activities net increase in cash and cash equivalents the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities of million in from was primarily related to a reduction in medicare funding  an increase in our insurance and related payments  as well as a decrease in our incremental cash collections on patient accounts receivable 
our nursing facilities patient accounts receivable have continued to decline throughout and our cash collections on these accounts receivable continue to be in line with  or ahead of  our generated revenues 
however  during our cash collections were significantly higher than our generated revenues due to collections of old patient balances 
having substantially completed these collection efforts during  our incremental cash collections returned to a more normalized amount in in addition  our patient accounts receivable increased during due to certain medicaid rate increases for which we will not receive payment until these factors have resulted in a year over year decline in the cash generated from accounts receivable 
in  we completed a full evaluation of our nursing facility portfolio  which included the identification of non strategic facilities and facilities that account for a disproportionately high share of projected patient care liability costs 
as a result of this analysis  we have divested a significant portion of our nursing facility capacity 
during the year ended december   we sold  closed or terminated the leases on nursing facilities  seven assisted living centers  and one managed facility  of which nursing facilities and six assisted living centers were part of this divestiture strategy 
we received net cash proceeds of million from the sales of these nursing facilities  our former matrix outpatient therapy clinics and managed care network  certain assets of our home care segment and other assets 
these net proceeds were primarily used to repay approximately million of long term debt  pay off million of off balance sheet lease financing  fund capital expenditures totaling million  and increase our cash on hand 
during october  we entered into a new million senior credit facility the credit facility 
the credit facility consists of a five year million term loan facility and a four year million revolving credit facility 
the revolving credit facility will be available for general corporate purposes and up to million for the issuance of letters of credit 
the term loan facility is fully drawn and we are utilizing million of the revolving credit facility for letters of credit 
the credit facility currently bears interest at 
table of contents the prime lending rate plus  or the eurodollar rate plus  at our option 
the credit facility is secured by mortgages on certain nursing facilities  has a security interest in certain patient accounts receivable  is guaranteed by substantially all of our present and future subsidiaries and imposes on us certain financial tests and restrictive covenants 
concurrent with the credit facility transaction  we issued through a public offering million of convertible subordinated notes due the convertible notes 
the convertible notes are subordinated in right of payment to all of our existing and future senior debt 
the convertible notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at an initial conversion price of per share  at the option of the holder when certain conditions are met prior to maturity 
as of december   none of the conversion conditions had been met and therefore  the common shares into which the convertible notes may be converted were not included in the calculation of our diluted earnings per share 
assuming the convertible notes had been converted into shares of our common stock effective january   our unaudited pro forma diluted net income per share for the year ended december  would have been reduced by per share to per share diluted  based on a total number of shares outstanding of approximately  the net proceeds from these refinancing transactions were used as follows to redeem all million of our outstanding senior notes due and to pay the applicable premium of million  to redeem million of our industrial development revenue and first mortgage bonds  to repay million of our mortgage obligations  and to pay transaction fees and expenses and for general corporate purposes 
these transactions enabled us to extend principal maturities  invest significantly more capital expenditures for future growth and reduce our weighted average interest rate by approximately two percentage points or approximately million in annual interest expense 
in november  the board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program whereby we may repurchase  from time to time on the open market  up to million of our outstanding common stock  effective december  and remaining in effect for one year 
as of december   no shares had been repurchased under this authorization and any such repurchases will occur during open trading windows  if at all 
we currently have an off balance sheet financing arrangement of million medium term notes 
these notes are obligations of bfc 
according to the provisions of these notes  principal payments on these obligations begin in the second quarter of we expect these obligations will be paid off by the third quarter of therefore  as of march   bfc will no longer purchase receivables from bhrs  but will only collect previously purchased receivables and use the proceeds to pay off the medium term notes and our investment 
we expect the primary impacts on our consolidated balance sheet will be an increase in patient accounts receivable and an elimination of our investment in bfc 
we expect the successful completion of our divestiture strategy  while resulting in a significant reduction in our revenues  will reduce our patient care liability costs  reduce outstanding debt and strengthen the nursing facility portfolio going forward 
over the next two years  we expect to continue the implementation of initiatives to improve our fundamental business processes and reduce costs by approximately million throughout the organization 
we can give no assurance that we will be able to execute the divestiture strategy in a timely manner at fair values or that we will be able to reduce costs to achieve our stated objective within the time period projected 
we currently anticipate that cash on hand  cash flows from operations and availability under our banking arrangements will be adequate to repay our debts due within one year of million  to make capital additions and improvements of approximately million  to make operating lease and other contractual obligation payments  to make selective acquisitions  including the purchase of previously leased facilities  to repurchase shares of our common stock and to meet working capital requirements for the twelve months 
table of contents ending december  if cash flows from operations or availability under our existing banking arrangements fall below expectations  we may be required to utilize cash on hand  delay capital expenditures  dispose of certain assets  issue additional debt securities  or consider other alternatives to improve liquidity

see item note as of december   we have off balance sheet debt guarantees of million that primarily arose from our sales of nursing facilities
