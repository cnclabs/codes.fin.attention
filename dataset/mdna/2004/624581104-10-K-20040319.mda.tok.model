item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we operate approximately  home video retail stores that rent and sell movies and video games  primarily in rural and secondary markets throughout north america 
we compete with the other two national chains blockbuster and hollywood entertainment in only approximately one third of our store locations 
we believe that we are the market leader in the majority of our target markets 
we estimate that there are approximately  to  markets still available for expansion in rural america  as well as opportunities throughout canada and mexico 
we currently plan to open between and new stores in and  subject to market and industry conditions  to continue to open new stores on a similar pace over the next several years 
we believe the most significant dynamic in our industry is the relationship our business maintains with the movie studios 
the studios have historically maintained an exclusive window for home video distribution packaged goods which provides mass merchants and video retailers approximately a day period during which they can sell and rent new releases before they are made available on pay per view or other distribution channels 
the home video distribution channel currently provides over of studio revenue 
for this reason  we believe movie studios have a significant interest in maintaining a viable home video business 
for a more detailed discussion of our business and the home video industry  see the business discussion contained in part i  item of this annual report on form k 
our strategies are designed to achieve reasonable  moderate and consistent growth in same store revenues and profitability  in a mature industry 
we foster a corporate culture of cost control  striving to minimize the operating and overhead costs associated with our business which allows us to maximize profitability and which has proven to be a successful operating model for us 
our balance sheet reflects million in cash and cash equivalents as of the end of fiscal and we have not had any outstanding long term debt since may our store base has increased in excess of in each of the last three fiscal years 
in addition to the relationship between our industry and the movie studios  our operating results are driven by revenue  inventory  rent and payroll 
given those key factors  we believe that by monitoring the five operating performance indicators described below  we can continue to be successful in executing our operating plans and our growth strategy 
revenues 
our business is a cash business with initial rental fees paid upfront by the customer 
our management team constantly works with inventory levels  marketing and sales promotions  real estate strategies and personnel issues in order to maximize profitable revenues at each location 
additionally  our team monitors revenue performance on a daily basis to quickly identify trends or issues in our store base or in the industry as a whole 
product purchasing economics 
in order to maintain the desired profit margin in our business  purchases of inventory for both rental and sale must be carefully managed 
our purchasing models are designed to analyze the impact of the economic factors inherent in the various pricing strategies employed by the studios 
we believe that we are able to achieve purchasing levels tailored for the customer demographics of each of our markets and to maximize the return on investment for our inventory purchase dollars 
store level cost control 
the most significant store expenses are payroll and rent  followed by all other supply and service expenditures 
our fundamental philosophy with respect to store level expenses is to exercise extreme conservatism in spending 
this is achieved primarily through budgeting systems and centralization of purchases into the corporate support center 
this enables us to measure performance carefully against expectations and to leverage our purchasing power 
our rural focus also provides the benefit of reduced labor and real estate costs in the secondary markets we serve versus the costs associated with larger urban markets 
leverage of overhead expenses 
we apply the same principles of budgeting  accountability and conservatism in our overhead spending that we employ in managing our store operating costs 
our general and administrative expenses include the costs to maintain our corporate support center as well as the overhead costs of our field management team 
operating cash flows 
we have generated significant levels of cash flow for several years 
we are generally able to fund the majority of our store growth and acquisitions  as well as ongoing inventory purchases  from cash flow generated from operations 
cash flow has been sufficient to allow us to maintain a debt free balance sheet since may the following detailed discussion of our results of operations  liquidity and capital resources will provide further insight into our performance over the last three years 
results of operations selected financial statement and operational data fiscal year ended fiscal year ended january  january  january  january  january  january  in thousands  except per share data percentage of total revenue revenues rental product sales total revenues cost of sales rental product sales total gross margin store operating expenses g a expenses operating income net income net income per diluted share same store revenues gross margin percentage rental product sales total gross margin store count beginning of period new store builds stores acquired stores closed end of period the following table itemizes certain non cash or nonrecurring items that are included in our operating results for the fiscal years presented and which are referenced throughout this discussion of our results of operations and financial condition fiscal year ended fiscal year ended january  january  january  january  january  january  in thousands  before tax per diluted share  after tax rental amortization policy change legal settlement supply contract amendment stock option compensation revenue 
for fiscal and  total revenues increased and  respectively  from the prior years 
the increases were primarily due to same store revenue growth of in fiscal and in fiscal as well as overall growth in the average number of stores operated in fiscal of and in fiscal the increases in same store revenues primarily resulted from continued growth of dvd rental and sales revenue  offset partially by corresponding declines in revenue from vhs products due to the consumer transition to dvd  increases in the sales of previously viewed inventory  higher video game rental revenues driven by our increased commitment to our game library  and growth resulting from overall video game industry increases and consumer acceptance of new platforms released late in fiscal benefited from increased product sales revenue as a result of a significant expansion of new movie inventory available in the stores beginning during the latter half of  fiscal reflects continued revenue growth in the video update stores we acquired in december and other acquisitions and new stores built over the last two years  and fiscal also benefited from a favorable new movie release schedule versus fiscal the increases in same store revenues for fiscal were partially offset by unfavorable weather during the first half of as compared to the first half of  the broadcast of the winter olympics during the first quarter of  and an extra week of revenues totaling approximately million in fiscal cost of sales 
the cost of rental revenues includes the amortization of rental inventory  revenue sharing expenses incurred and the cost of previously viewed rental inventory sold 
the gross margin on rental revenue for fiscal  and was  and  respectively 
the most significant factors that impacted growth in the gross margin on rental revenue were the increasing shift of movie rentals from vhs to dvd dvd rentals constituted approximately  and  of total movie rentals in fiscal  and  respectively  dvd has a lower cost structure than vhs has traditionally had  and the acceptance of dvd has influenced reductions in studio pricing of the vhs format during the last year  and  the purchase price allocation of video update that produced lower than normal rental inventory amortization in the first half of rental margins were negatively impacted by a change in estimate related to our amortization policy for rental inventory during the fourth quarter of fiscal see note to our consolidated financial statements  opportunities taken to increase the overall quantity of rental units purchased for our stores as a result of the lower cost structure associated with dvd versus historical vhs pricing  amortization of our investment in dvd catalog inventory that took place in the first quarter of in order to satisfy increasing consumer demand for movies on the dvd format  and investments in our video game rental library to provide significant copy depth of all game platforms in our stores 
cost of product sales includes the costs of new dvds  videocassettes  concessions and other goods sold 
the gross margin on product sales is subject to fluctuation based on the relative mix of low margin new movie inventory sales versus higher margin sales of concessions and other items 
the gross margin on product sales for fiscal  and was  and  respectively 
the product sales margin reflects the following trends in inventory mix fiscal margins were reduced by significant discounting that was designed to facilitate the liquidation of older titles and other slow moving inventory  the results achieved in fiscal reflect our reduced levels of low margin catalog inventory that was liquidated in fiscal  and  fiscal margins are representative of an increase in our mix of new movie sales in order to accommodate an increased consumer demand for retail movies and to complement our rental business as consumers transition to dvd 
operating costs and expenses 
store operating expenses include store level expenses such as lease payments and in store payroll 
store operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue was  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in store operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue in fiscal was primarily due to a higher cost structure associated with the video update stores acquired in december and the benefits in fiscal of an extra week of revenues 
the following factors partially offset the increase in fiscal and contributed to a reduction of store operating expenses as a percentage of revenues in fiscal continued initiatives to reduce operating costs  strong performance of new stores  continued closure of under performing units  and same store revenues increase of in fiscal and in fiscal additionally  store operating expenses as a percentage of revenues in fiscal were reduced by leverage from our video update transaction against same store revenue increases and were increased slightly as a result of the large number of immature stores in our store base that are absorbing the start up expenses associated with a new store while the revenue levels are still ramping up 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses include the following items which have offset the leverage obtained against the increased revenues associated with the growth in our store base fiscal a charge of million related to an amendment of our supply agreement with rentrak corporation  fiscal a legal settlement charge of million regarding our extended viewing fee policy  fiscal costs and expenses associated with the conversion of the video update stores point of sale system  and fiscal overhead increases to support new initiatives and our future growth plans  which include expansion into new geographic areas where our market penetration is lower 
amortization of intangibles declined significantly in fiscal due to goodwill no longer being amortized pursuant to the adoption of fasb statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  as of the beginning of fiscal stock option compensation expense represents the non cash charge associated with certain stock options that were repriced during the first quarter of fiscal and are subsequently accounted for as variable stock options see note to our consolidated financial statements 
we expect to continue to record adjustments to income from stock option compensation in future periods 
due to the relatively small number of these options that remain outstanding  we expect future adjustments to be insignificant 
operating income 
as a result of the impact of the above factors on revenues and expenses  operating income increased by in fiscal and by in fiscal interest expense 
interest expense includes fees for the unused borrowings available under our credit facility and amortization of the associated debt issue costs  as well as the costs of any outstanding borrowings under our credit facility  net of interest income 
interest expense declined significantly in fiscal and again in fiscal due to the repayment of all outstanding debt in may and our ability to maintain a debt free balance sheet throughout income taxes 
we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards at january  resulting primarily from the video update acquisition see note to our consolidated financial statements of approximately million that expire in years through we have recorded a valuation allowance of million related to the deferred tax assets of million resulting from the net operating loss carryforwards 
this valuation allowance has been established as there exists uncertainty regarding our ability to realize these net operating losses in their entirety 
if facts and circumstances in the future should warrant an increase in the net operating loss carryforwards expected to be realized  a reduction in the valuation allowance could occur and may result in a reduction in our effective income tax rate  which was  and for fiscal  and  respectively 
deferred income tax liabilities have increased significantly during fiscal this is primarily the result of a significant acceleration in the tax depreciation of newly purchased assets since the fourth quarter of we anticipate this liability will continue to increase unless we stop or significantly slow our new store growth  or until the acceleration provisions are discontinued 
the acceleration on tax depreciation is a result of special provisions implemented after the events of september  and is currently scheduled to be discontinued for assets placed in service after january  if the special provisions are not extended  the cumulative excess tax depreciation levels we currently have will begin to decline 
general economic trends  quarterly results of operations and seasonality our business is subject to fluctuations in operating results due to a number of factors  many of which are outside of our control 
these fluctuations may be caused by  among other things the number  timing and performance of new or acquired stores  public acceptance of  interest in  and availability of  newly released movies  our mix of products rented versus sold  marketing programs and new release acquisition costs  seasonality compared to other months during the year  we experience peak revenues during the months of november  december and january due to the holidays in these months as well as inclement weather conditions 
additionally  revenues generally rise in the months of june  july and august when most schools are out of session  providing people with additional discretionary time to spend on entertainment  and special events  such as the olympics or ongoing major news events of significant public interest 
liquidity and capital resources our primary capital needs are for opening and acquiring new stores and for purchasing inventory 
other capital needs include refurbishing  remodeling and relocating existing stores and refreshing  rebranding and supplying new computer hardware for acquired stores 
we fund inventory purchases  remodeling  rebranding and relocation programs  new store opening costs and acquisitions primarily from cash flow from operations and  if necessary  loans under revolving credit facilities 
at january   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  no long term debt and million in available borrowings under our credit facility 
fiscal year ended january  january  january  statements of cash flow data net cash provided by operating activites net cash used in investing activities net cash used in provided by financing activities other data adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda percent of total revenue the increases in net cash provided by operating activities were primarily attributable to revenue growth and continued efforts to maximize economies of scale within our expense structure 
net cash provided by operating activities continues to be sufficient to cover substantially all of our rental inventory replenishment and capital resource needs 
net cash used in investing activities includes our operating purchases of rental inventory  as well as the costs of acquisitions and new store builds 
the increases are primarily due to increased rental inventory purchases to support growth in the store base  the dvd catalog investment in the first quarter of and increasing levels of new store builds 
the increase in fiscal was partially offset by a reduction in business acquisitions versus net cash provided by financing activities includes proceeds from the exercise of stock options and proceeds from our stock offering in may  offset by the repayment of amounts outstanding under our credit facility in fiscal and in december  our board of directors instituted a new dividend policy under which it declared an initial quarterly cash dividend of per share 
we currently intend to pay similar quarterly cash dividends on our common stock 
however  the payment of future dividends is subject to the discretion of our board of directors 
future dividends may be increased  decreased or suspended from time to time based on a number of factors  including changes in tax laws related to dividends  our financial condition  capital requirements  future business prospects  the terms of any documents governing our indebtedness and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant 
adjusted ebitda in fiscal and increased and  respectively  over the prior years 
these increases were primarily driven by the revenue increases during those periods and continued efforts to maximize economies of scale within our expense structure 
adjusted ebitda is defined as earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  non cash stock option compensation and nonrecurring items  less our purchases of rental inventory which excludes rental inventory purchases specifically for new store openings 
adjusted ebitda is presented not as an alternative measure of operating results or cash flow from operations as determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  but because  in the home video specialty retail industry  it is a widely accepted financial indicator of a company s ability to finance its operations and meet its growth plans  in that it treats rental inventory as being expensed upon purchase instead of being capitalized and amortized 
this measure is also used by us internally to make new store and acquisition investment decisions and to calculate awards under incentive based compensation programs 
our calculation of adjusted ebitda is not necessarily comparable to reported ebitda and or adjusted ebitda of other companies due to the lack of uniform definitions of ebitda and adjusted ebitda 
see selected financial data in part ii  item of this form k for our calculation of adjusted ebitda 
on june   we entered into a credit agreement with a syndicate of banks  led by southtrust bank  with respect to a revolving credit facility 
our credit facility is unsecured and  as amended  provides for borrowings of up to million through final maturity on july  the interest rate on our credit facility is based on libor plus an applicable margin percentage  which depends on cash flow generation and borrowings outstanding 
in december  as required by the credit facility  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement in order to hedge exposure to interest rate fluctuations on million of outstanding debt at a fixed rate of plus an applicable margin percentage 
in may  we repaid all amounts outstanding under our credit facility with the proceeds from our stock offering and terminated the interest rate swap agreement 
the costs to terminate the interest rate swap were expensed and were immaterial to our results of operations 
as of january   there were no outstanding borrowings under our credit facility 
the amounts available for borrowing were reduced by standby letters of credit outstanding of million and totaled million as of january  the following table discloses our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of january  see notes and to our consolidated financial statements payments due by period in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years after years credit facility outstanding operating leases unconditional purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations the total commercial commitment under our credit facility is million  which expires on july  as of january   there were standby letters of credit outstanding under the credit facility of  of which  expires in  and  expires in represents our commitment under a supply contract with rentrak corporation 
at january   we had a working capital deficit of million  due to the accounting treatment of rental inventory 
rental inventory is treated as a noncurrent asset under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states because it is a depreciable asset and a portion of this asset is not reasonably expected to be completely realized in cash or sold in the normal business cycle 
although the rental of this inventory generates the major portion of our revenue  the classification of this asset as noncurrent results in its exclusion from working capital 
the aggregate amount payable for this inventory  however  is reported as a current liability until paid and  accordingly  is reflected as a reduction in working capital 
consequently  we believe that working capital is not an appropriate measure of our liquidity and we anticipate that we will continue to operate with a working capital deficit 
we grow our store base through internally developed and acquired stores 
we opened internally developed stores during fiscal and expect to open between and new stores in subject to market and industry conditions  we plan to continue to open new stores on a similar pace over the next several years 
we acquired stores during fiscal we will continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities in as they arise 
to the extent available  new stores and future acquisitions may be completed using funds available under our credit facility  financing provided by sellers or alternative financing arrangements such as funds raised in public or private debt or equity offerings 
however  we cannot assure you that financing will be available to us on terms which will be acceptable  if at all 
we believe our projected cash flow from operations  cash on hand  borrowing capacity under our credit facility and trade credit will provide the necessary capital to fund our current plan of operations  including our anticipated new store openings and acquisition program  through fiscal however  to fund a major acquisition  or to provide funds in the event that our need for funds is greater than expected  or if the financing sources identified above are not available to the extent anticipated or if we increase our growth plan  we may need to seek additional or alternative sources of financing 
this financing may not be available on satisfactory terms 
failure to obtain financing to fund our expansion plans or for other purposes could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
our ability to fund our current plan of operations and our growth plan will depend upon our future performance  which is subject to general economic  financial  competitive and other factors that are beyond our control 
we cannot assure you that our business will continue to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to fund capital resource needs  cover the ongoing costs of operating the business and service any debt incurred in the future 
if we are unable to satisfy these requirements with cash flow from operations and cash on hand  we may be required to sell assets or to obtain additional financing 
we cannot assure you that any such sales of assets or additional financing could be obtained 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in november  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a concensus on issue no 
 accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor  effective for fiscal years beginning after december  eitf generally requires that cash consideration received from a vendor be considered as a reduction of the prices of the vendor s products  reflected as a reduction of cost of sales in the customer s income statement 
the presumption can be overcome if the vendor receives an identifiable benefit in exchange for the consideration  in which case the consideration should be recorded as revenue  or if the consideration represents a reimbursement of a specific identifiable incremental cost incurred by the customer in selling the vendor s products where the consideration should be characterized as a reduction of that cost 
our adoption of this standard as of january  did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in january  the financial accounting standards board issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
the interpretation 
the interpretation requires the consolidation of entities in which an enterprise absorbs a majority of the entity s expected losses  receives a majority of the entity s expected residual returns  or both  as a result of ownership  contractual or other financial interests in the entity 
currently  entities are generally consolidated by an enterprise when it has a controlling financial interest through ownership of a majority voting interest in the entity 
the interpretation is effective as of december  for all qualifying interests in special purpose entities spes in existence as of january  and as of february  for all qualifying spes obtained after january  we had no qualifying interests as of january  we have subsequently made equity investments in other entities during none of which are spes 
these investments are immaterial  and consolidation is not currently required under the interpretation 
the provisions of the interpretation  as revised by the fasb in december  must be applied to some of our investments in the first quarter of based on our analysis to date  none of our current interests will have a significant impact on our financial statements upon adoption of the interpretation s consolidation rules 
in may  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
statement clarifies the classification and measurement of certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity  and is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   or otherwise for the first interim period beginning after june  the adoption of statement had no material impact on our net earnings  cash flows or financial position 
critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of the financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate the estimates that we have made 
these estimates have been based upon historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different conditions or using different assumptions 
we believe our most critical accounting estimates include our policies with respect to rental inventory amortization  impairment of long lived assets  purchase price allocation of acquired businesses and deferred income taxes 
a major component of our cost structure is based upon the method by which we amortize our rental inventory 
rental inventory is amortized to an estimated salvage value over an estimated useful life of up to two years 
we amortize the cost of rental inventory using an accelerated method designed to approximate the rate of revenue recognition 
this method is based on our historical experience and is dependent upon the net realizable value of our inventory and the demand patterns of the rental products we provide 
we believe our estimated useful lives and salvage values are appropriately matched to our current rental business and are consistent with industry trends 
however  should rental patterns of consumers change or should market values of existing inventory decline due to the acceptance of new formats ongoing vhs transition to dvd  anticipated transition to high definition dvd within three to five years  release of new video game formats  etc  this could necessitate an acceleration in our current rental amortization rates or a reduction in salvage values 
we believe that any acceleration in the rental amortization rates would not have a long lasting impact as the majority of rental purchases are substantially depreciated within the first two to three months under our existing policy 
we could be required to reduce salvage values that we currently carry on vhs inventory if we are unable to dispose of that inventory at a rate relatively consistent with the consumers transition to dvd 
as of january   we had million in rental inventory on our balance sheet 
we assess the fair value and recoverability of our long lived assets  including property  furnishings and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives  whenever events and circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition 
in doing so  we make assumptions and estimates regarding future cash flows and other factors in order to make our determination 
the fair value of our long lived assets is dependent upon the forecasted performance of our business  changes in the video retail industry  the market valuation of our common stock and the overall economic environment 
when we determine that the carrying value of our long lived assets may not be recoverable  we measure any impairment based upon the excess of the carrying value that exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets 
we have not recognized any impairment losses on long lived assets since fiscal if we do not meet our operating forecasts or if the market value of our stock declines significantly  we may have to record impairment charges not previously recognized 
we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis 
additionally  goodwill is tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of an entity below its carrying value 
these events or circumstances would include a significant change in the business climate  legal factors  operating performance indicators  competition  sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business or other factors 
we have not recorded any impairment losses on goodwill since a fiscal impairment charge of  if we do not meet our operating forecasts or if the market value of our stock declines significantly  we may have to record additional impairment charges not previously recognized 
as of january   we have million in goodwill on our balance sheet 
we estimate the fair value of assets and liabilities of acquired businesses based on historical experience and available information at the acquisition date 
we engage independent valuation specialists to assist when necessary 
if information becomes available subsequent to the acquisition date that would materially impact the valuation of assets acquired or liabilities assumed in business combinations  we may be required to adjust the purchase price allocation 
with the exception of the video update acquisition in  we have not experienced any significant adjustments to the valuation of assets or liabilities acquired in business combinations in the last seven years 
our acquisitions are typically small businesses for which we generally do not assume liabilities and for which the assets acquired consist primarily of inventory  fixtures  equipment and intangibles 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance based upon historical losses  projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
as a result of this review  we have established a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carryforwards that we acquired in the acquisition of video update 
if facts and circumstances in the future should warrant elimination or reduction of the valuation allowance related to these acquired net operating loss carryforwards  our effective income tax rate  which was  and for fiscal  and  respectively  could be reduced 
related party transactions please refer to note to our consolidated financial statements for disclosures regarding our significant related party transactions 
forward looking statements with respect to forward looking statements  please refer to the disclosures set forth under cautionary statements in part i  item of this form k 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the market risk inherent in our financial instruments represents the increased interest costs arising from adverse changes in interest rates primarily libor and prime bank rates 
we currently have no amounts outstanding under our credit facility and  thus  no exposure to adverse interest rate changes 
we are exposed to foreign exchange risks associated with our canadian and mexican operations 
historically  the canadian exchange rates have been relatively stable and we believe the impact of fluctuations in the currency exchange rates will be immaterial to our financial position and results of operations 
based on fiscal results  a hypothetical change in the canadian exchange rate would impact our consolidated financial position and results of operations by less than 
our mexican operations are currently limited to one location 
growth in is not expected to be significant enough to result in a material impact from fluctuations in currency exchange rates
