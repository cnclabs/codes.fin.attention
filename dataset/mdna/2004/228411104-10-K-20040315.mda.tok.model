item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
advertising revenue the advertising market differs greatly around the world 
in the united states  the most developed television market  there is a growing sentiment among advertisers that advertising expenditures are shifting from broadcast television to cable television according to tns media intelligence comepetitive media reporting when comparing expenditures in to those in as of december   according to tns media intelligence competitive media reporting  of all advertising expenditures were spent on cable television and of all advertising expenditures were spent on broadcast television in the united states 
in other parts of the world  the amount spent by advertisers on television varies according to the development of each country s television market 
in general  advertising expenditures are less in other countries than in the united states  both in terms of percentage of advertising expenditures as well as absolute dollars 
program ratings systems in many non united states markets are growing rapidly  and as a result  advertisers are relying less on subscriber counts and more on empirical measurements when buying advertising time 
television advertising is sold in a variety of formats 
many pay television channels rely largely upon the spot advertisement format 
spot advertisements are normally seconds long and air during or between programs 
they are often sold in packages of a certain number of spots or to deliver a certain number of viewers 
an alternative to spot advertising is sponsorship  by which a company sponsors a program or selection of programs on a channel by applying their branding around the programming 
the ability of a television channel to generate advertising revenue largely depends on estimated or actual viewing levels  primarily based on ratings  and on advertising rates 
typically  in the united states and some other markets  independent ratings systems on which advertising sales can be based are well established and widely accepted within the industry 
in addition  pay television channel providers and distributors may also provide estimated or actual subscriber information 
our us channel sells the majority of its advertising in the up front season  generally in august  for the last quarter of the same year and the first three quarters of the following year 
we hold back a small percentage of our inventory for audience deficiency units  adus  and sell the remainder in the spot market 
adus are units of inventory that are made available to advertisers as compensation for inventory the advertiser purchased that ran in programs that under delivered on the guaranteed ratings 
historically  advertisers have spent more on advertising through traditional broadcast television than through pay television 
we believe that as pay television continues to gain viewership relative to broadcast television  it should attract a larger percentage of the total available dollars spent on television advertising 
also  as pay television draws audience share from broadcast television  audience demographics become fragmented  and  as a result  advertisers are able to target groups of viewers with specific demographic profiles 
since february  paid commercial programming  infomercials  has been carried on a limited basis in several international regional feeds of the hallmark channel and also on our domestic channel 
ratings for the year  the domestic hallmark channel was rated the fastest growing cable network in terms of annual audience percentage growth in ratings for compared to  with a increase in ratings for total day and a two fold increase in household impressions 
the channel experienced increases of more than over in all of its key demographics for adults and women for total day 
these comparisons are from data of nielsen media research for and for the ad supported cable channels in the united states market 
among the ad supported cable channels in the united states market  the hallmark channel ranked th in total day with a household rating for the year and nd for prime time with a household rating for the year  according to nielsen media research 
in among the approximately ad supported cable channels in the united states market  the hallmark channel ranked th in total day with household rating for the year and th for primetime with household rating for the year  according to nielsen media research 
total day means the time period measured from the time each day the broadcast of commercially sponsored programming commences to the time such commercially sponsored programming ends 
household impressions are the average number of television households watching a channel during a specific time period 
we believe that the key demographics for the hallmark channel are the viewers in the groups adults and women internationally  during the international hallmark channel ranked in the top ten cable and satellite channels in the uk according to the broadcaster audience research board 
in the uk  the channel enjoyed a strong and sustained increase in ratings over the past two years  increasing its television rating among adults by from and its share  or percentage of viewing audience  among adults by 
the channel is the th most watched commercial non terrestrial channel in poland according to agb polska for the year 
in denmark  ratings have grown from december to december according to gallup 
the channel ranks among the top ten multi channel networks in hungary according to agb hungary for the year 
licensing revenue program suppliers sell or license programming to broadcasters and video distributors pay television channel providers who pay a license fee for the right to exploit air the programming over a certain period in their program package 
our licensing of film assets is an important contributor to our revenues and  because the amortization of our film assets is a non cash expense  also to our cash flow

distribution in the countries where we offer the international channel  we distribute the channel through a variety of distribution platforms  including cable  satellite broadcast systems  digital terrestrial television and satellite master antenna television 
we distribute the channel through distribution agreements with local pay television operators such as bskyb  canal digital  foxtel  measat  multichoice  and pctv 
our distribution agreements with such operators generally last from two to five years 
we have the capability to create and deliver our channel to new platforms in a short period of time through our broadcast infrastructure based in greenwood village  colorado 
we have entered into a strategic relationship with pramer  sca  which performs all day to day operations including program acquisitions  scheduling  marketing  advertising and affiliate sales  playback and uplink for our operations in mexico  central and south america 
we regularly review existing and potential markets to assess their prospects 
as the number of international channel subscribers increases in a market  we assess our ability to increase revenue or develop new revenue sources by subdividing the market through the addition of satellite signals to individual countries within that market as opportunities particularly advertising arise 
when we subdivide a market  we are able to customize the channel to appeal to a more specific audience 
the delivery of the international channel to more targeted audiences also increases the number of potential advertisers on the channel by creating more targeted advertising opportunities for local or regional businesses in the markets in which we operate 
the following chart shows the approximate number of television households and pay television households  as estimated by kagan world media at december  except where noted  and the number of our international channel subscribers at year end and hallmark channel int l subscribers hallmark channel int l december  of pay tv households markets total tv house holds pay tv house holds pay tv penetration december december s s asia pacific australia   india     indonesia   korea     malaysia   new zealand  philippines   singapore   taiwan     thailand   subtotal     europe  middle east and africa africa  belgium netherlands   bulgaria croatia slovenia yugoslavia   czech republic   denmark   finland iceland   hungary   israel     italy  middle east   norway   poland     portugal   romania     russia bosnia   slovak republic  spain   sweden   turkey   united kingdom     subtotal     latin america argentina     brazil   chile   colombia   mexico     venezuela   other latin america     subtotal     total     total subscribers include promotional free subscribers at december   and december  india includes bangladesh  brunei  macau  maldives  new guinea  republic of palau  and sri lanka source zenith optimedia

we generally charge our pay television distributors a fee per subscriber for the right to broadcast our international channel 
we have increased the number of subscribers to our international channel in the past year  and as a result  have achieved an increase in revenue generated from subscriber fees 
for the years ended december    and revenue derived from subscriber fees for the international channel were approximately million  million  and million  respectively 
international fees per subscriber have and will continue to experience downward pressure due to the competitive nature of the industry  the growth of digital cable  political and economic turmoil in latin america and the shift in the industry in the more developed countries from subscriber fee revenue to advertising revenue 
our international fees may decline if we exit certain markets and utilize strategic alliances in other markets 
we also derive revenue from the sale of advertising time on our international channel 
we generate revenue directly from advertisers as well as from our pay television distributors under distribution agreements that may provide for a sharing of revenue from advertising 
we believe that the number of subscribers to our international channel and the favorable demographics of its family focused audience provide us with the opportunity to increase revenue from the sale of advertising time 
lower guaranteed advertising revenue in our united kingdom market and fluctuating foreign exchange rates may hinder increases in certain markets 
currently advertising revenue from our international channel is derived primarily from activities in a limited number of countries  including east asia  mexico  poland  south africa  the united kingdom and certain countries in latin america 
for the years ended december    and revenue from the sale of advertising on our international channel were million  million  and million  respectively 
our network operations center  which enables us to control delivery of our channels to our pay television distributors  allows us to insert commercials into our programming from a central point and we can deploy new feeds quickly while benefiting from economies of scale 
insertion of a commercial can also take place in a country  which sometimes occurs in south africa  the united kingdom and argentina 
the company currently has international sales offices in buenos aires  hong kong  london  mumbai  sydney and taipei 
sales and marketing our international channel focuses its marketing efforts on maximizing our two revenue streams  distribution and advertising sales  in the individual markets in which the channel is distributed 
our international channel s marketing efforts vary by market depending on the maturity of the local television industry  the level of distribution of our channel and the potential for the sale of advertising 
in markets where our international channel is not carried by all the pay television distributors  marketing efforts are primarily directed toward potential new distributors 
these efforts include advertising in trade publications and participating in industry trade shows as well as direct mail and public relations campaigns 
in these markets  efforts are also made to market the channel to potential viewers to drive consumer demand for carriage of the channel by local affiliates 
in markets where our international channel has obtained substantial distribution or has exclusive agreements with primary distributors  marketing efforts are primarily directed toward maintaining subscribers and viewership 
our efforts in these markets are primarily directed toward a target of adults to these efforts often include traditional marketing campaigns consisting of on air promotion  print  billboard  cross channels  radio and television advertising and sometimes these efforts are partially funded by our pay television distributors in each market 
additionally  we emphasize our unique relationship with our primary content supplier  hallmark entertainment distribution  through the use of premier screening events  press tours with actors and actresses and viewer trips to movie sets 
we also use our website to market and promote the channel to consumers through schedule information  movie synopses  games and contests all of which are localized across the region 
this is addition to a comprehensive business to business website for our external customers such as journalists  affiliates and local agents 
in markets where we are developing our international channel s advertising business  marketing efforts are also directed toward potential advertisers 
when marketing the hallmark channel to potential advertisers  we use local representation to target media planners and buyers and international advertisers 
network operations center crown media international reached an agreement with kse media ventures  llc to be the playback and uplink services provider for kmv regional sports channel  which will launch in august  from the company s network operations center in denver  colorado 
channel operations the programming departments at each of our regional offices or partners are responsible for ensuring the consistent quality of the programming we offer 
the programming  scheduling and acquisitions departments work in conjunction with the traffic department and creative services to create the distinctive appearance of our channels 
some of these functions are outsourced on an as needed basis 
the creation of our channels begins with the acquisition of programming 
we have over titles in the crown media library 
in addition  we license programming from hallmark entertainment distribution and other program suppliers 
our staff or third parties review and summarize all potential programming to ensure compliance with our quality and content standards 
the acquisitions staff in our regional offices licenses programming based on the amount of new programming required on the channels 
each of the acquisitions offices work together to leverage multi channel acquisitions across many territories to reduce license fees  but remain sensitive to specific markets with targeted localized programming 
in most of our international markets  we customize the hallmark channel by dubbing or subtitling program elements into local languages 
the decision to customize the channel into local languages is based on local market practices  viewer preferences and cost considerations 
language preparation is coordinated in the regional offices in london and hong kong and by pramer in buenos aires 
program language elements are typically shipped to the specific region to ensure that nuances in dialect of the particular language are captured 
the language versions are then combined with the other programming elements 
the creation of on air promotional segments interstitials  which are broadcast between the feature movies  miniseries and series  are typically outsourced to external vendors 
promotional segments are prepared in many languages for broadcast worldwide 
these interstitials are intended to invite viewership  guide viewers to specific programming  and promote brand awareness for the hallmark channel 
the scheduling department in each region creates the play list  which contains a list of daily programming 
the scheduling department works with marketing personnel to continuously monitor the programming mix 
the play list is then forwarded to the traffic department 
the traffic department inserts promotional segments and advertising into the play list and creates the daily log  which contains a detailed schedule of the stream of programming  commercials and promotional materials that will ultimately be viewed by the subscriber for each regional feed of the hallmark channel 
the daily log  together with digital tapes that contain the corresponding programming  are then forwarded to either our network operations center or  to the third party facility  which is performing the playback and uplink services for the feed 
digital tapes that contain the promotional segments are forwarded to either our network operations center or to the third party origination and playback facility separately 
channel delivery we deliver the daily log and digital tapes to our network operations center or to a third party origination and playback facility for each market  where the programming  promotional and advertising elements are combined and compressed into a single signal  and transported to an uplink facility 
the uplink facility then transmits the signal to the satellite transponder that covers the relevant geographic market  and the transponder reflects the signal back within its designated geographic area to head end facilities and direct to home satellite services operated by pay television distributors who receive and decode our signal and transmit our channel 
our global network operations center consisting of  square feet at our greenwood village  colorado headquarters commenced operations in february and has the ability to perform origination and playback services for up to programming channels 
the network operations center is an efficient  state of the art broadcasting operation 
the facility enables us to efficiently expand distribution into new markets  control delivery of our channels to our pay television distributors  thereby enhancing on air quality and reliability  while containing cost  enhance our ability to generate advertising revenue  distribute programming in digital and other formats as required in the rapidly evolving broadband distribution environment  while consolidating our library management  and offer playback and related services to other channel providers 
in  we launched the central europe  eastern europe  russia  middle east  israel  latin america  spain  turkey and scandilux feeds from our network operations center 
in february  the playback operations for the two domestic feeds of the hallmark channel were transferred from a facility in los angeles to the network operations center in denver 
by the end of the second quarter of  the playback operations of all the channel s asian feeds were moved from a facility in hong kong to the network operations center 
also in the second quarter of  pramer started producing the channel s four feeds for latin america at a facility in buenos aires  however  three of the feeds are then be transmitted back to our network operations center for distribution over our satellite capacity to our affiliates in most of latin america

amounts payable under these contracts are reflected in operating and capital leases in the schedule of contractual commitments as of december  as shown in item below 
film distribution crown media distribution owns the crown media library and generates revenue from the film assets in the library by granting licenses to use the films to third parties 
we are also using the films as programming for our television channels and interactive uses 
crown media distribution oversees sales and distribution of the crown media library to third party licensees 
third party licensees purchase available rights  which primarily include all forms of television and home video 
crown media distribution has a service agreement with hallmark entertainment  providing for services relating to the administration  distribution and other exploitation of the crown media library  and directs the hallmark entertainment sales force worldwide in all sales matters pertaining to the crown media library 
this services agreement expired on december   and the parties renewed this agreement 
the new services agreement contains the same terms and conditions as the previous agreement and will expire on december  competition the pay television industry is highly competitive 
our channels compete for distribution  viewers and advertisers with other pay television channels  broadcast television channels and with other general forms of entertainment 
there are several sources of competition within our industry  each of which affects our business strategy 
our domestic channel competes with other general entertainment programming from tnt  usa network  a e  the discovery channel  lifetime  abc family and other similarly targeted channels 
our international channel competes with general entertainment programming from axn  i sat  canal fox  tnt  uk gold and usa network 
we compete with these channels for viewers and advertising dollars based upon quality of programming  number of subscribers  ratings and subscriber demographics 
we compete with all channels for carriage on cable and satellite systems that may have limited capacity 
information on our ratings in the united states and in the united kingdom is described under company overview above 
at december   the hallmark channel ranked th in total day in the number of television households reached in the united states  out of the cable networks measured by nielsen 
our standing in other international markets varies 
competition continues to intensify as the industry shifts from analog distribution to digital distribution 
many pay television distributors have upgraded their physical infrastructures to accommodate digital delivery  which provides significantly more channel capacity 
we believe that it will take several years for the majority of current subscribers to convert to  and begin paying for  upgraded services 
in an effort to accelerate the conversion  pay television distributors are attempting to place new channels on their digital tier as opposed to their limited  yet more widely distributed  analog tiers 
although competition for the remaining widely distributed analog channel space is still intense  as more and more subscribers are converted  the digital tier is expected to become the dominant platform 
competitive strengths we have established a track record of providing high quality programming throughout the world 
we believe that our primary competitive strengths include the following pay television channels branded with the well known hallmark name our channels are branded with the hallmark name 
we believe that viewers and distributors associate the hallmark brand with family values and high quality content and that our association with this brand facilitates our efforts to achieve increased distribution and to attract additional viewers that leads to higher ratings and advertising revenue 
long term distribution contracts that call for increasing subscriber counts and fees at december   we had long term distribution agreements with adelphia  cablevision  charter  comcast  cox  directv  echostar  mediacom  nctc  and time warner in the united states  as well as a number of other distributors 
the terms of our major distribution agreements generally provide for subscriber increases over time  although some provide for lower or no subscriber fees if certain levels of subscribers are achieved 
a library of popular and award winning programming and guaranteed access through long term agreements to other similar programming our library of more than titles gives us control over a significant amount of popular and award winning programming that we can either air on our channels or license to third parties 
these titles provide us with a portion of our core programming  and by owning these titles  we have the flexibility to use them as needed to create the most effective program schedules 
owning these titles also eliminates the license fees we otherwise would have to pay for these titles and provides a revenue stream for us from licensing the titles to third parties 
we have a five year program agreement with hallmark entertainment ending december   that provides us with access to new quality productions  as well as to the titles in the hallmark entertainment distribution library that we did not purchase 
experienced management members of our senior management team have experience launching  promoting and operating channels both domestically and internationally 
they have held senior positions at such companies as the discovery channel  cable satellite public affairs network  the news corporation  telecommunications international  inc  abc  cbs sports  turner network television  mediaone international  the golf channel and usa networks 
competitive risks one channel distributed domestically and internationally we operate one channel  although the programs on the channel in the united states and in various countries differ 
many competitors have more than one channel and may also be diversified entertainment companies  giving them an advantage in dealing with distributors and advertisers 
these companies are also able to leverage costs across multiple channels 
entertainment programming our programming is entertainment designed for adults and families and is intended to meet quality standards that are associated with the hallmark trademark 
competitors may have more flexibility in programming 
ratings which affect advertising our ratings have improved substantially over the last two years in the united states and in the united kingdom and other parts of europe 
nevertheless  our competitors include channels with more subscribers and higher ratings in these countries  which affects rates that we can charge for advertising 
pramer distribution arrangements a majority of our operations in mexico and central and south america are handled by a local distribution partner in argentina  pramer 
as discussed further under risk factors and forward looking information below  we are therefore dependent on pramer to sell our channel to local distributors and to gain sufficient advertising 
research the research departments at the company provide strategic and tactical guidance to decision makers within the company  as well as supplying information about the channel to potential advertisers and affiliates 
these departments provide data on the size and demographics of our audience and information about our audiences  competitors  markets and industry 
currently  our domestic channel s research department translates our overall business strategy into a cohesive research program 
this information assists our executives to more effectively target  brand  promote  program  and better understand where opportunities lie  in order to increase our domestic channel s market share 
the research department has sophisticated ratings systems npower  pnf and adviews and competitive tracking database hardware and software 
trends and changes from these ratings systems are reported to top management for short and long term strategic planning 
our domestic channel s performance is tracked through an internal tracking study established in july  which is a monthly telephone survey conducted among a national probability sample of approximately  adults 
since january  the department has also subscribed to equitrends research for brand data  which includes quality  salience  and equity scores for both television networks and all brands 
another valuable resource is cable q  a research service that advertisers and networks have subscribed to for more than thirty years 
cable q data is useful for monitoring the level of viewer satisfaction 
the tvq cable q system is distinguished by its ability to measure the commitment viewers develop over time to specific shows and cable networks 
historically  this resource has served the industry as a reliable indicator of future success 
in the united kingdom  we obtain ratings and audience demographic information from the broadcaster s audience research board barb 
barb provides estimates of the number of people watching television  which channels and programs they are watching at any time  and the type of people watching 
this information is provided for all analog and digital platforms 
viewing estimates are obtained from panels of television owning households representing the viewing behavior of over million households in the united kingdom 
employees we had employees at both december  and neither we nor any of our subsidiaries are parties to collective bargaining agreements 
we believe that our relations with our employees are good 
substantially all of our international channel s employees work at our headquarters in greenwood village  colorado and london  england 
substantially all of our domestic channel s employees work at our offices in studio city  california and new york  new york 
regulation the operations of television channels in the markets in which we operate  including the united states  are regulated 
the scope of regulation varies from country to country  although in many significant respects  a similar approach is taken to the regulation of broadcasting across all of the markets in which we operate 
for example  throughout most of our western european markets  broadcasting regulation has been formally harmonized to a substantial degree under the regulatory structure of the european union 
typically  broadcasting regulation in each of the countries in which we operate requires that domestic broadcasters and platform providers secure broadcasting licenses from the domestic broadcasting authority 
additionally  many nations have broadcasting legislation and regulations  which set minimum standards regarding program content  and scheduling of television advertisements 
some provide that a certain portion of programming carried by broadcasters be produced domestically and  to some degree  be sourced from domestic production companies which are independent of the broadcaster 
local pay television distributors in foreign countries typically have a statutory duty to ensure that the programming and advertising that they re transmit on behalf of foreign broadcasters conforms to the regulatory scheme under which each local platform provider is licensed 
our contracts with many of our local platform providers require that our programming comply with domestic broadcasting regulations 
generally  each of our pay television distributors and thus our programming carried on their systems must adhere to the broadcasting and advertising regulations of each platform provider s licensing jurisdiction 
as indicated above  the laws and regulations applicable to the hallmark channel apply in general to our distributors and not directly to us 
we rely in part on information provided by our local distributors in taking steps to comply with applicable laws 
within the united states  program access rules applicable to channel providers with ownership ties to pay television distributors limit business combinations between these two types of companies that do not comply with these rules 
financial information about geographic areas information concerning revenue and long lived assets attributable to external customers  domestically and internationally  may be found in note of our notes to consolidated financial statements in this report 
risk factors and forward looking statements the discussion set forth in this annual report on form k contains statements concerning potential future events 
such forward looking statements are based on assumptions by crown media holdings management  as of the date of this annual report on form k including assumptions about risks and uncertainties faced by crown media holdings 
readers can identify these forward looking statements by their use of such verbs as expects  anticipates  believes  or similar verbs or conjugations of such verbs 
if any of management s assumptions prove incorrect or should unanticipated circumstances arise  crown media holdings actual results  levels of activity  performance  or achievements could materially differ from those anticipated by such forward looking statements 
among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are those discussed below in this form k 
crown media holdings will not update any forward looking statements contained in this annual report on form k to reflect future events or developments 
if we do not successfully address the risks described below  our business  prospects  financial condition  results of operations or cash flow could be materially adversely affected 
the trading price of our class a common stock could decline because of any of these risks 
risks relating to our business our business has incurred net losses since inception and may continue to incur losses 
both our international and domestic channels have a history of net losses and we expect to continue to report net losses for the foreseeable future 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million  total stockholders equity of approximately million  goodwill of approximately million  and film assets of million 
we cannot assure you that we will achieve or sustain profitability 
if we are not able to achieve or sustain profitability  the trading price of our class a common stock may fall significantly 
to diminish our losses and become profitable  we will need to substantially increase our revenue  particularly advertising and licensing revenue 
this will require  among other things  increasing the distribution of our channels  attracting more viewers to our channels  attracting more advertisers  and increasing our advertising rates 
risks associated with these areas of our business are described below 
in addition  in order to accomplish these goals  the management of crown media holdings continues to believe that it is necessary to increase subscribers and enhance our programming  which results in increased subscriber acquisition fees and higher costs for programming 
over the last three years  these actions have resulted in increased net losses for crown media holdings 
our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health  and the restrictions imposed by the terms of our debt instruments may severely limit our ability to plan for or respond to changes in our business 
we have a substantial amount of indebtedness 
as of december   our total debt was million and we had million of cash and cash equivalents 
in addition  we may borrow additional amounts under our bank credit facility to supplement the payments received under the tax sharing agreement with hallmark cards to cover the negative cash flow resulting from our current operations 
subject to restrictions under our debt agreements  we may also seek equity or debt financing from time to time to cover our operating losses  to finance acquisitions or capital expenditures or for other purposes 
for further information on the tax sharing agreement  see part iii item certain relationships and related transactions tax sharing agreement 
as a result of our level of debt and the terms of our debt instruments our vulnerability to adverse general economic conditions is heightened  we will be required to dedicate a portion of our cash flow from operations to repayment of debt  limiting the availability of cash for other purposes  we are and will continue to be limited by financial and other restrictive covenants in our ability to borrow additional funds  consummate asset sales  enter into transactions with affiliates or conduct mergers and acquisitions  our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and industry will be limited  we are sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates  and our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  general corporate purposes or other purposes may be impaired 
our ability to meet our debt and other obligations and to reduce our total debt depends on our future operating performances and on economic  financial  competitive and other factors 
there can be no assurance that our leverage and such restrictions will not materially and adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities 
we have increasing interest expense  which may impact our future operations 
high levels of interest expense could have negative effects on our future operations 
interest expense  which is net of interest income and includes amortization of debt issuance costs and interest expense on borrowings under our senior and demand notes and bank credit facility  increased substantially over the past year 
the increase in interest expense in the past twelve months resulted from an increase in the average borrowings outstanding  due to cash generated from operations being insufficient to cover operating expenses and capital expenditures 
a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations must be used to pay our interest expense and will not be available for other business purposes 
in addition  we may need to incur additional indebtedness in the future 
we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow or that future financings will be available to provide sufficient proceeds to meet our obligations or to service our total debt 
our liquidity is dependent on external funds 
because we currently operate at a loss and may have a negative cash flow  any unanticipated significant expense or any development that hampers our growth in revenue or decreases any of our revenue  would result in the need for additional external funds in order to continue operations 
we have no arrangements for any external financings  whether debt or equity  and are not certain whether any such new external financing would be available on acceptable terms 
any new debt financing would require the cooperation and agreement of existing lenders 
modification of any existing agreements with united states distributors could decrease our subscriber fees revenue but  if our distribution is increased  it could also result in higher advertising revenue 
several of the crown media united states existing distribution agreements contain most favored nations clauses 
these clauses typically provide that  in the event crown media united states enters into an agreement with another distributor on more favorable terms  these terms must be offered to the existing distributor  subject to certain exceptions and conditions 
distribution agreements which we may enter into in the future may also contain similar most favored nation clauses 
in the past  crown media in the united states was asked to comply with such clauses and modify its distribution agreements with certain distributors after entering into a new distribution agreement with directv in august see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding settlements in prior years with two large distributors in the united states 
any claims under these clauses in the future could result in the payment of cash or the issuance of stock by us to our distributors and would negatively affect subscriber revenues  however  if our subscription base is increased as a result of such modification  it could result in higher advertising revenue 
if we are unable to obtain programming from third parties  we may be unable to increase our subscriber base 
we compete with other pay television channel providers to acquire programming 
if we fail to continue to obtain programming on reasonable terms for any reason  including as a result of competition  we could be forced to incur additional costs to acquire such programming or look for alternative programming  which may hinder the growth of our subscriber base 
if our programming declines in popularity  our subscriber fees and advertising revenue could fall and the additional revenue we expect as a result of the acquisition of film assets from hallmark entertainment distribution may be lower than we anticipate 
our success depends partly upon unpredictable and volatile factors beyond our control  such as viewer preferences  foreign exchange rates  competing programming and the availability of other entertainment activities 
we may not be able to anticipate and react effectively to shifts in tastes and interests in our markets 
in particular  our ability to react effectively may be limited by our obligation to license programming from hallmark entertainment distribution  which has standards that limit the types of programming that it will provide to us 
our competitors may have more flexible programming arrangements  as well as greater amounts of production  better distribution  and greater capital resources  and may be able to react more quickly to shifts in tastes and interests 
as a result  we may be unable to maintain the commercial success of any of our current programming  or to generate sufficient demand and market acceptance for our new programming 
a shift in viewer preferences in programming or alternative entertainment activities could also reduce the amount of revenue we anticipate receiving from licensing of our film assets and cause a decline in both advertising and subscriber fees revenue 
the decline in revenue could hinder or prevent us from achieving profitability and could adversely affect the market price of our class a common stock 
we are currently dependent on hallmark entertainment to distribute and maximize licensing fees from the film assets 
currently  we are dependent on hallmark entertainment to distribute and license our film assets to third parties for us under a services agreement 
this services agreement expired on december   and the parties renewed this agreement 
the new services agreement contains the same terms and conditions as the previous agreement and will expire on december  this arrangement reduces our control over the sales and distribution of the film assets and might delay our realization of the full revenue stream from the film assets 
we and hallmark entertainment each have the right to terminate the service agreement on a yearly basis 
if hallmark entertainment elects to terminate the agreement before we have established our own distribution network  we may not be able to establish our own or obtain alternative distribution services of equivalent quality or on terms as favorable to us 
termination of this services agreement could hinder our ability  at least in the short term  to achieve the amount of additional revenue anticipated from these activities and could adversely affect the market price of our class a common stock 
we anticipate that in due course we will develop our own distribution sales network and hire employees to perform the services currently performed by hallmark entertainment under the service agreement 
our ability to do so is unproven and will require financial  operational and management resources 
we may not be able to hire the number of employees  or employees who are sufficiently qualified  to perform these services  or do so in a cost efficient manner 
if the cost to develop and maintain this employee base is greater  or if this process takes longer than anticipated  it could have a negative impact on the revenue we anticipate generating from the film assets 
if we are unable to increase our advertising revenue  we may be unable to achieve profitability 
although it is expected over time that our advertising revenue will increase  if we fail to increase significantly our advertising revenue  we may be unable to achieve or sustain profitability or to expand our business 
a failure to increase advertising revenue may be a result of any or all of the following i we have a limited history of marketing and selling advertising time  particularly internationally  ii we may be unable to identify  attract and retain experienced sales and marketing personnel with relevant experience for our us channel  iii our sales and marketing organization may be unable to successfully compete against the significantly more extensive and well funded sales and marketing operations of our current or potential competitors  iv the advancement of technologies such as digital video recording may cause industry wide changes concerning the frequency in which individuals are exposed to advertising on television  and or v we will not be able to increase our advertising sales rate card or may be required to run additional advertising spots which affect the availability of advertising inventory for future sales 
success in increasing our advertising revenue also depends upon the number and coverage of the distributors who carry our channels  our number of subscribers  and the viewership ratings for our programming 
the international cable advertising market is much less developed than in the united states  the united kingdom and central europe 
we believe that only certain international markets have the potential for growth in advertising revenues and intend to emphasize those markets but cannot assure success 
hallmark entertainment investments controls us and this control could create conflicts of interest or inhibit potential changes of control 
hallmark entertainment investments controls all of our outstanding shares of class b common stock and owns shares of class a common stock  representing approximately of the outstanding voting power on all matters submitted to our stockholders 
hallmark entertainment holdings  a subsidiary of hallmark cards  controls the voting of all our shares held by hallmark entertainment investments 
hallmark entertainment investments control could discourage others from initiating potential merger  takeover or other change of control transactions that may otherwise be beneficial to our business or holders of class a common stock 
as a result  the market price of our class a common stock could suffer  and our business could suffer 
hallmark entertainment investments control relationship with us also could give rise to conflicts of interest in certain situations 
we could lose the right to use the name hallmark because we have limited duration trademark license agreements  which could harm our business 
we license the name hallmark from hallmark cards and hallmark licensing  inc  for various uses  including in the name of our international and domestic channels  and this license expires on september  if hallmark cards determines not to renew the trademark license agreements for any reason  including our failure to meet minimum programming thresholds dependent on programming provided by affiliates of hallmark cards or to comply with hallmark cards programming standards  we would be forced to significantly revise our business plan and operations  and could experience a significant erosion of our subscriber base and advertising revenue  particularly in the united states 
if our third party suppliers fail to provide us with network infrastructure services on a timely basis  our costs could increase and our growth could be hindered 
we currently rely on third parties to supply key network infrastructure services  including uplink  playback  transmission and satellite services to certain of our markets  which are available only from limited sources 
we have occasionally experienced delays and other problems in receiving communications equipment  services and facilities and may  in the future  be unable to obtain such services  equipment or facilities on the scale and within the time frames required by us on terms we find acceptable  or at all 
if we are unable to obtain  or if we experience a delay in the delivery of  such services  we may be forced to incur significant unanticipated expenses to secure alternative third party suppliers or adjust our operations  which could hinder our growth and reduce our revenue and potential profitability 
if our network operations center fails or its operations are disrupted  our costs could increase and our growth could be hindered 
we are currently using the network operations center for the origination and playback of signals for the hallmark channel both domestically and internationally 
like other single point facilities  the network operations center is subject to interruption from fire  tornadoes  lightning and other unexpected natural causes 
although we have redundant systems in place  equipment failure  employee misconduct or outside interference could also disrupt the network operations center s services 
we currently do not have and are not planning a duplicate operations facility 
any significant interruption at the network operations center affecting the distribution of our channels could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
if our local distribution partner for the latin american region fails to perform  our operations could be disrupted and our business harmed 
in the first quarter of  we moved the majority of our operations concerning the distribution of the hallmark channel in mexico  central and south america to a local distribution partner in argentina  pramer  primarily to substantially reduce our expenses for operations in this region 
if pramer is unable to adequately perform the functions of selling our channel to local operators  to gain sufficient advertising sales and to appropriately market the channel  or  if pramer s services are significantly interrupted for any reason  we may not improve our performance in latin america 
if we are unable to retain key executives and other personnel  our growth could be inhibited and our business harmed 
our success depends on the expertise and continued service of our executive officers and key employees of our subsidiaries 
if we fail to attract  hire or retain the necessary personnel  or if we lose the services of our key executives  we may be unable to implement our business plan or keep pace with developing trends in our industry 
we are subject to the risks of doing business outside the united states 
historically  a significant portion of our revenue has been generated from foreign operations 
in order to maintain or expand our presence in foreign markets  we have entered and may in the future enter into joint ventures or other strategic relationships with local operators in those markets 
certain foreign laws  regulations and judicial procedures may not be as protective of programmer rights as those applicable in the united states 
in addition  many foreign countries have currency and exchange laws regulating the international transfer of currencies 
to the extent that significant currency fluctuations result in materially higher costs to any of our foreign customers  those customers may be unable or unwilling to make the required payments 
we may be subject to delays in access to courts and to the remedies local laws impose in order to collect our payments and recover our assets 
we also may experience problems with collecting accounts due from foreign customers  which would adversely affect our revenue and income 
our growth and profitability may also suffer as a result of  among other matters  competitive pressures on video delivery  labor stoppages  recessions and other political or economic events adversely affecting world or regional trading markets or affecting a particular customer 
our current and future operations in emerging markets may be harmed by the increased political and economic risks associated with these markets 
we currently broadcast in several foreign markets where market economies have only recently begun to develop  and we may expand these operations in the future 
if the governments in these markets adopt more restrictive economic policies  we may not be able to continue operating  or to implement our expansion plans  in those markets 
more generally  we are exposed to certain risks  many of which are beyond our control  inherent in operating in emerging market countries 
these risks include changes in laws and policies affecting trade  investment and taxes including laws and policies relating to the repatriation of funds and to withholding taxes  differing degrees of protection for intellectual property and the instability of emerging market economies  currencies  and governments 
the amount of our goodwill  as well as our film costs  may hinder our ability to achieve profitability 
as a result of our acquisitions of all the common interests in crown media united states and h h programming asia  we have generated a significant amount of goodwill 
we ceased the amortization of this acquired goodwill  and we are required to periodically review whether the value of our goodwill has been impaired 
if we are required to write down our goodwill  our results of operations  stockholders equity or profitability could be materially adversely affected 
we also have a film cost relating to the amortization of the purchase price for the film assets that we use and license to others 
this film cost is  and will continue to be  a significant component of our cost of services each quarter 
our stock price may be volatile and could decline substantially 
the stock market has  from time to time  experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
many factors may cause the market price for our class a common stock to decline  including our operating results failing to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors in any quarter  material announcements by us or our competitors  governmental regulatory action  technological innovations by competitors or competing technologies  investor perceptions of our industry or prospects  or those of our customers  and changes in general market conditions or economic trends 
additionally  of the approximately million shares of the company s outstanding class a common stock  only million shares approximately are not held by affiliates of the company 
this stock ownership structure may also be a cause of volatility in the market price of the company s class a common stock 
risks relating to our industry the proposed change in television ratings in the united states could reduce our channel revenue and our ability to achieve profitability 
our domestic advertising revenues are partially dependent on television ratings provided by nielsen media research 
nielsen is currently modifying its ratings system by increasing its household sample size 
our ratings could either be positively or negatively affected by these changes  depending on the demographic characteristics of the households added to the nielsen sample 
competition could reduce our channel revenue and our ability to achieve profitability 
we operate in the pay television business  which is highly competitive 
if we are unable to compete effectively with large diversified entertainment companies that have substantially greater resources than we have  our operating margins and market share could be reduced  and the growth of our business inhibited 
in particular  we compete for distribution with other pay television channels and  when distribution is obtained  for viewers and advertisers with pay television channels  broadcast television networks  radio  the internet and other media 
we also compete  to varying degrees  with other leisure time activities such as movie theaters  the internet  radio  print media  personal computers and other alternative sources of entertainment and information 
future technological developments may affect competition within this business 
a continuing trend towards business combinations and alliances in both the domestic and foreign communications industries may create significant new competitors for us or intensify existing competition 
many of these combined entities have more than one channel and resources far greater than ours 
these combined entities may provide bundled packages of programming  delivery and other services that compete directly with the products we offer 
these entities may also offer services sooner and at more competitive rates than we do 
in addition  these alliances may benefit from both localized content and the local political climate 
we may need to reduce our prices or license additional programming to remain competitive  and we may be unable to sustain future pricing levels as competition increases 
our failure to achieve or sustain market acceptance of our programming at desired pricing levels could impair our ability to achieve profitability or positive cash flow  which would harm our business 
distributors in the united states may attempt to increasingly pressure smaller pay tv channels in terms of viewership  such as our domestic hallmark channel  to accept decreasing amounts for subscriber fees  to pay higher subscriber acquisition fees or to allow carriage of the channel without the payment of subscriber fees 
factors that may lead to this pressure include the number of competing pay tv channels  the limited space available on services of distributors in the united states and the desire of distributors to maintain or reduce costs 
any reduction in subscriber fees revenue now or in the future could have a material impact on our ability to achieve profitability and cash flow 
new distribution technologies may fundamentally change the way we distribute our channels and could significantly decrease our revenue or require us to incur significant capital expenditures 
our future success will depend  in part  on our ability to anticipate and adapt to technological changes and to offer  on a timely basis  services that meet customer demands and evolving industry standards 
the pay television industry has been  and is likely to continue to be  subject to rapid and significant technological change  including continuing developments in technology which do not presently have widely accepted standards  and frequent introductions of new services and alternative technologies  including new technologies for providing video services 
for example  the advent of digital technology is likely to accelerate the convergence of broadcast  telecommunications  internet and other media and could result in material changes in the economics  regulations  intellectual property usage and technical platforms on which our business relies  including lower retail rates for video services 
these changes could fundamentally affect the scale  source  and volatility of our revenue streams  cost structures  and profitability  and may require us to significantly change our operations 
we also rely in part on third parties for the development of  and access to  communications and network technology 
as a result  we may be unable to obtain access to new technology on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms  which could harm our business and prospects 
moreover  the increased capacity of digital distribution platforms  including the introduction of digital terrestrial television  may reduce the competition for the right to carry channels and allow development of extra services at low incremental cost 
these lower incremental costs could lower barriers to entry for competing channels  and place pressure on our operating margins and market position 
in addition  a greater number of channels would likely increase competition among channels for viewers and advertisers  which could affect our ability to attract advertising and new distribution at desired pricing levels  and could therefore hinder or prevent the growth of our subscriber base 
if we fail to comply with applicable government regulations  our business could be harmed 
if  as a provider of television channels  we fail to comply with applicable present or future government regulations in any markets in which we operate  we could be prohibited from operating in those markets and could be subject to monetary fines  either of which would increase our operating costs  reduce our revenue and limit our ability to achieve profitability 
the scope of regulation to which we are subject varies from country to country  although in many significant respects a similar approach is taken to the regulation of broadcasting across all of the markets in which we operate 
typically  broadcasting regulation in each of the countries in which we operate requires that domestic broadcasters and platform providers secure broadcasting licenses from the domestic broadcasting authority 
additionally  most nations have broadcasting legislation and regulations  which set minimum standards regarding program content  and prescribe minimum standards for the content and scheduling of television advertisements 
some countries require that a certain portion of programming carried by broadcasters be produced domestically 
moreover  broadcasting regulations are generally subject to periodic and on going governmental review and legislative initiatives  which may  in the future  affect the nature of programming we are able to offer and the means by which it is distributed 
the timing  scope or outcome of these reviews could be unfavorable to us  and any changes to current broadcasting legislation or regulations could require adjustments to our operations

the domestic cable industry is saturated with channels striving to position themselves on lower tiers and on digital platforms of cable tv distributors 
the company has less leverage in the marketplace in regard to tier positioning and advertising sales than many of our competitors since they operate multiple channels while we operate only one channel 
among other things  owners of multiple channels are able to leverage demand for their more popular channels to convince distributors and advertisers to distribute and advertise on their less successful channels 
our ratings and subscribers must continue to grow in future years in order to increase subscriber demand for our channel and our advertising revenues 
the company strives to obtain additional subscribers by renegotiating distribution agreements  and  as a result  may face increased subscriber acquisition fee payments 
the company also attempts  and has succeeded  in improving its ratings by acquiring new programming and revising its programming schedules to meet the demands of its viewers 
a larger audience share results in higher advertising rate cards  which  in turn  increases revenue 
domestically  we foresee in an increase in our advertising revenues due to better programming  growing subscriber counts  and the upcoming political campaigns 
in the united kingdom  we have acquired attractive programming  much of which has not been previously aired on cable television 
we expect this programming to attract additional viewers  resulting in increased ratings 
in our international market  our primary focus is to manage our investment  minimize our programming expenditures through the use of our film assets  expand our advertising customer base and thereby command increased subscriber fees and advertising revenue 
we face challenges to overcome political and economic problems in certain of our international markets 
management continuously evaluates our position in these countries 
the company completed the restructuring of its international segment during by decentralizing many oversight and non technical support functions formerly located in the company s us based offices and transferred those responsibilities to regional staff 
certain operating expenses decreased because of this action  primarily the expense related to leasing transponder space and salaries 
utilization of our film assets  both through external sales and internal use  is a significant focus of management 
this business provides us with a significant  additional source for revenue and cash flow 
external demand for our film library assets was lower than expected in prior years  but we anticipate higher sales with the improvement of the economy and an increase in incentives for our sales force 
the primary financial and non financial measures analyzed by management are adjusted ebitda and the metrics driving each of our revenue lines such as subscriber counts  advertising rates  domestic ratings and ratings for certain international markets  demographics of our viewing audiences  and programming quality 
cash flow our management is striving to increase cash flows in and future years through the sale of advertising 
the company has a goal of being cash flow positive and adjusted ebitda positive for the full year ending december   barring unforeseen circumstances 
we will also continue to monitor expenses  and  potentially  reduce marketing and other general and administrative expenses in to meet our cash flow goals 
if our cash flow improves  we will also focus in the future on lowering borrowings under our bank credit facility 
our present plan includes the refinancing of the bank credit facility during as well as the hc crown line of credit 
significant uses of cash during were for program acquisitions in primarily our domestic and united kingdom markets 
the company also paid subscriber acquisition fees resulting from renegotiated distribution agreements in and prior years 
attainment of certain subscriber levels will also cause an increase in subscriber acquisition fee payments in future years  but  as many of our more significant distribution agreements expire in  we do not foresee significant subscriber acquisition fee payments until after revenue our revenue consists of subscriber fees  advertising and film license fees 
subscriber fees subscriber fees are generally payable to us on a per subscriber basis by pay television distributors for the right to carry our channels 
in the united states  we pay certain television distributors up front subscriber acquisition fees to carry our channel 
however  such payments are not common in the international cable television markets 
subscriber acquisition fees that we pay are capitalized and amortized over the contractual term of the applicable distribution agreement as a reduction in subscriber fee revenue 
if the amortization expense exceeds the revenue recognized on a per distributor basis  the excess amortization is included as a component of cost of services 
at the time we sign a distribution agreement  we evaluate the recoverability of the costs we incur against the incremental revenue directly and indirectly associated with each agreement 
rates we receive per subscriber vary according to the level of sophistication and degree of competition in the market  the relative position in the market of the distributor and the popularity of the channel  the packaging arrangements for the channel  and other commercial terms such as granting the distributor exclusivity to carry our channel only in territories outside the us and length of term of the contract 
in some circumstances  international distributors provide minimum revenue guarantees 
we are in continuous negotiations with both our existing distributors and new distributors to increase our subscriber base in order to enhance our advertising results 
in the united states  we are often subject to requests by distributors to pay subscriber acquisition fees for additional subscribers or to waive or accept lower subscriber fees if certain numbers of additional subscribers are provided 
in both domestic and international markets we also may help fund the distributors efforts to market our channels or we may permit distributors to offer limited promotional periods without payment of subscriber fees 
as we continue our efforts to add subscribers  our subscriber revenue will continue to be negatively affected by subscriber acquisition fee expenses  waiver of subscriber fees and bulk discounts resulting from the attainment of certain subscriber levels  however  we believe that as a result of these measures  our subscriber counts will increase which in turn will allow us to attract additional advertisers and command higher advertising rates 
for information regarding amendments to distribution agreements in the united states  including as part of those amendments settlement of claims regarding most favored nation clauses  please see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we also expect international subscriber rates to decrease as we renew distribution agreements at lower subscriber rates 
these international rates are affected by the increasing competitive nature of the industry  the growth of digital cable  the shift in the industry in more developed countries from subscriber fee revenue to advertising revenue  foreign currency devaluation associated with global economies and the economic turbulence in certain of our markets 
although we anticipate international subscriber rates to decrease  we expect subscriber counts to increase and  thereby  offset the negative effect the decreased rates will have on revenue 
a distribution agreement with a primary pay television distributor in spain was amended on october  under the amendment  the distribution of our channel to that party can end on december   at which time a new distribution agreement will have to be negotiated 
for additional information  see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
our channel is usually offered as one of a number of channels on either a basic tier or part of other program packages 
our channel is generally not offered on a stand alone basis 
thus  while a cable or satellite customer may subscribe and unsubscribe to the tiers and program packages in which our channel is placed  these customers do not subscribe and unsubscribe to our channel alone 
we are not provided with information from the distributors on their overall subscriber churn and in what manner their churn rates affect our subscriber counts  we instead are provided information on the total number of subscribers who receive the hallmark channel 
our subscriber count depends on the number of distributors carrying the hallmark channel and the size of such distributors as well as the program tiers on which our channel is carried by these distributors 
from time to time  we experience decreases in the number of subscribers domestically and internationally as promotional periods end or a distributor arrangement is amended or is terminated by us or the distributor 
changes to distribution arrangements in to date have been minor and have been more than offset by the increases in subscribers through other new or amended distribution agreements 
management analyzes the estimated effect each new or amended distribution agreement will have on revenues and costs 
based upon these analyses  management endeavors to arrive at a fair combination of subscriber commitments and subscriber acquisition fees has been reached with each of our domestic distributors 
advertising advertising sales generally are made on the basis of a price per advertising spot or per unit of audience measurement for example  a ratings point 
prices vary on a market by market basis 
rates differ among markets depending on audience demographics 
in markets where regular audience measurements are available  our advertising rates are generally calculated on the basis of an agreed upon price per unit of audience measurement in return for a guaranteed investment level by the advertiser 
in these countries  we commit to provide advertisers certain rating levels in connection with their advertising 
revenue is recorded net of estimated delivery shortfalls  which are usually settled by providing the advertiser additional advertising time 
in other less sophisticated markets  our advertising rates are calculated on the basis of cost per advertising spot or package of advertising spots  and the price varies by audience level expected but not measured during a particular time slot 
this is the predominant arrangement in the countries outside the united states in which we sell advertising time 
advertising rates also vary by time of year based on seasonal changes in television viewership 
film licensing crown media distribution generates revenue from the film assets by granting licenses to exhibit the films to third parties 
we are also using the films as programming for our television channels 
customers for our film assets consist of other television channels  home video distributors and brokers who resell rights to our film assets in various international markets 
license fees for our film assets are generally negotiated based upon the size of the potential audience who will be viewing the programming 
cost of services our cost of services consists primarily of program license fees  amortization of our film assets  subscriber acquisition fee expense  the cost of signal distribution  dubbing and subtitling programming for foreign audiences  administration  distribution and other exploitation of our film assets  and the cost of promotional segments that are aired between programs 
we expect cost of services to continue to increase in the future as we expand our existing markets and third party programming to support our advertising strategy 
we expect the cost of services to increase in the year compared to because of the following we intend to acquire or use a greater amount and variety of quality programming as part of our efforts to continue the increases in our ratings  the amortization of film assets will increase when sales of those assets increase  and we anticipate higher levels of subscriber acquisition fee amortization as result of incremental increases in the distribution of our channel 
many costs will remain constant as compared to  particularly cost of signal distribution  administration  distribution and other exploitation of our film assets and the cost of promotional segments that are aired between programs 
overall  our goal is to increase our gross profit margin 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires crown media holdings to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
for information regarding accounting treatment and accounting policies concerning revenue  subscriber acquisition fees  program license fees  subtitling and dubbing  film assets  property and equipment  accounting for previously outstanding trust preferred securities  consideration of asset impairment  goodwill and intangible assets  taxes on income  stock based compensation  the reorganization and recently issued accounting pronouncements  please see the following notes to consolidated financial statements note  note concerning the reorganization and other charges  note with respect to program license fees  notes and with respect to taxes on income  and note with respect to stock based compensation 
the following discussion concerns certain accounting estimates and assumptions that are considered to be material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for uncertain matters and the susceptibility of such matters to changes 
revenue recognition subscriber fees from pay television distributors are recognized as revenue when an agreement is executed  programming is provided  the price is determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we estimate and record the level of subscriber fees one month in advance based upon the actual prior month s subscriber levels 
historical results support our method of estimating subscriber fee revenue as subscriber levels generally increase each month 
advertising revenues are recognized as earned in the period in which the advertising is telecast and are generally billed monthly 
if uncertainty as to the collectibility of this revenue exists  the revenue is recognized on a cash basis 
advertising revenue and expenses in barter transactions are recorded at the fair value of the advertising to be provided 
in certain markets  delivery of advertising is determined based upon data received from third parties who measure the ratings of our channels 
the ratings information drives our calculations of impressions delivered which in turn drives the amount of revenue we recognize from each advertising spot 
our advertising revenue is therefore heavily reliant upon these third party ratings estimates 
revenue from film asset licensing agreements is recognized when an agreement is executed  the film is available for exhibition by the licensee  the license fee is fixed or reasonably determinable  collectibility is reasonably assured and the cost of each film is known or reasonably determinable 
when multiple films are sold under a single arrangement  in order to properly recognize revenue when each license fee commences  we must estimate the relative fair value of each film and allocate the total contracted price to the different films in the arrangement 
our estimation of relative fair value uses similar information as is used in our annual third party valuation of our film assets 
cash basis accounting treatment is used in certain countries 
for the years ending december   and  million  million and  respectively  was invoiced  but not recorded as revenue 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company has established an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon historical charge off experience 
periodically  we analyze the attributes of the accounts which we have written off during the period and adjust the allowance percentages we apply to our aged receivable balances 
as noted previously  for revenue generated in certain countries in which economic factors lead us to believe that collectibility of these revenues is not reasonably assured  we recognize such revenue as it is received 
subscriber acquisition fees crown media united states has distribution agreements with every major cable distributor in the united states 
the initial recoverability of these subscriber acquisition fees is evaluated by projecting the incremental subscriber fee and advertising revenue attributable to the incremental subscribers obtained through the distribution agreement 
this analysis includes significant judgment and estimation by management 
film assets the company amortizes its film assets using the individual film forecast computation method over a maximum period of years from the date of acquisition  which amortizes such assets in the same ratio that current period actual revenue bears to estimated unrecognized ultimate revenues 
estimated unrecognized ultimate revenues are based on the history of each film and similar films  sales and marketing plans  and other factors  all of which require significant judgment by management 
effects of transactions with related and certain other parties hallmark transactions in and in prior years  we entered into a number of significant transactions with hallmark cards or its subsidiaries 
these transactions concern  among other things  programming  trademark licenses  administrative services  a line of credit  a tax sharing agreement and the sale of a million senior unsecured notes 
for detailed information regarding these transactions  please see part iii  item  certain relationships and related transactions 
tax sharing agreement in march  the company became a member of hallmark cards consolidated federal tax group and entered into a tax sharing agreement with hallmark cards  which was amended at the time the company issued the senior unsecured note to hc crown 
we account for income taxes as if crown media holdings were a separate taxpayer 
accordingly  hallmark cards ability to use our tax losses does not impact our assessment of the need for a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets  including future tax losses 
any payments received from hallmark cards under the tax sharing agreement are recorded as an increase in paid in capital 
during  the company received million under the tax sharing agreement 
for information regarding the tax sharing agreement  please see notes  and to the notes to consolidated financial statements

selected historical consolidated financial data of crown media holdings in the table below  we provide selected historical consolidated financial and other data of crown media holdings and its subsidiaries

total day is the time period measured from the time each day the broadcast of commercially sponsored programming commences to the time such commercially sponsored programming ends 
primetime is defined as pm in the united states 
these nielsen ratings are for the time period january through december crown media holdings evaluates operating performance based on several factors  including adjusted ebitda 
our measure of adjusted ebitda differs from the normal definition of ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization used by most companies 
we defined adjusted ebitda as earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization  subscriber acquisition fee amortization and amortization of film assets 
we believe adjusted ebitda is meaningful because it provides investors a means to evaluate the operating performance of our company on an ongoing basis using criteria that is used by other companies in our industry and investment bankers and analysts who track our industry 
we believe that adjusted ebitda is a meaningful measure because it represents a transparent view of our recurring operating performance and allows our management and investors to readily view operating trends  perform analytical comparisons and benchmark our company to similar companies in our industry 
adjusted ebitda is used by our management to monitor segment operations and to determine the allocation of resources to segments 
our credit facility also contains covenants that are based on an adjusted ebitda measure 
consequently  management views adjusted ebitda as a critical measure of our operating performance to meet our debt covenants and monitors this measure closely 
we disclose adjusted ebitda so that our investors can have some of the same information available to our management to evaluate their investment in our company 
we believe that adjusted ebitda provides an indication of the company s ability to generate cash flows from operating activities since the majority of our non cash expenses are excluded from our calculation of adjusted ebitda 
a significant portion of the company s cost structure relates to the amortization of film assets and subscriber acquisition costs  which are significant non cash charges 
the cash costs of acquiring film assets and adding subscribers are essentially discretionary expenditures 
the adjusted ebitda calculation allows the company to assess how much is available to pay debt service and gives a further indication of how much remains to fund discretionary expenditures such as the acquisition of film assets or additional subscriber base 
however  adjusted ebitda should be considered in addition to  not as a substitute for  historical operating income or loss  net loss  cash flow from operations and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
adjusted ebitda differs significantly from cash flows from operating activities reflected in the consolidated statement of cash flows 
cash flow from operating activities is net of interest and taxes paid and is a more comprehensive determination of periodic income on a cash basis  exclusive of non cash items of income and expenses such as depreciation and amortization 
in contrast  adjusted ebitda is derived from accrual basis income and is not reduced for cash invested in working capital 
consequently  adjusted ebitda is not affected by the timing of receivable collections or when accrued expenses are paid 
we are not aware of any uniform standards for determining ebitda or our adjusted ebitda and believe presentations of ebitda may not be calculated consistently by different entities in the same or similar businesses 
in the table below  we provide a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net loss and to net cash used in operating activities of crown media holdings and its subsidiaries

our revenue  which is comprised of subscriber fees  advertising and film asset license fees  increased for the year ended december  reduced subscriber fee rates in the united states due to amendments in prior periods to long term distribution agreements and cash basis accounting treatment of certain countries in latin america partially offset our increase in subscriber fee revenue due to expanded distribution internationally for the year ended december   resulting in a increase in such fees for the year 
subscriber acquisition fee expense recorded as a reduction of revenue was million for the year ended december   and million for the comparable period in although the number of subscribers to the hallmark channel increased as of december   compared to december   subscriber revenue was also affected by a number of other  offsetting factors  including discounts for new subscribers  and the waiver of subscriber fees and bulk discounts resulting from the attainment of certain subscriber levels 
subscribers have increased as a result of amended agreements in the united states and the united kingdom 
ninety percent of subscriber fees revenue for the year ended december   and eighty percent of subscriber fee revenue for the year ended december   respectively  was earned internationally 
the amount of subscriber fee revenue was million for the domestic hallmark channel for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  increased subscriber acquisition costs and other factors described above are expected to continue and result in a decline in domestic subscriber revenue 
certain of our international subscriber fee rates have and will continue to decrease as we renew distribution agreements  which may provide for lower per subscriber rates than under previous agreements 
international fees per subscriber are also expected to experience continuing downward pressure in the future due to the competitive nature of the industry  the growth of digital cable  the shift in the industry in certain more developed countries from subscriber fees revenue to advertising revenue  foreign currency devaluation associated with global economies and the economic turbulence in certain of our markets 
we anticipate that the decrease in fees per subscriber internationally will not result in a material decrease in international subscriber fee revenue  however  due to anticipated increases in the number of subscribers to the channels 
the increase in advertising revenue reflects the following during the growth in domestic and international subscribers  higher ratings in the united states  higher advertising rates resulting from the increase in distribution and viewership  and expanded sales of advertising time primarily in the united states 
the most dramatic increase in advertising revenue came from our domestic channel which was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  additionally  the number of advertisers on our domestic channel rose from at december   to at december  among the ad supported cable channels in the united states market  the hallmark channel ranked th in total day with a household rating for the fourth quarter of and st for primetime with a household rating for the same time period 
the increase in licensing fees earned during is due to four license agreements accounting for of total license fee revenue 
as demand for our product increased in  we focused our selling effort on a small number of customers 
also  our most significant licensing deal since the film asset acquisition occurred in cost of services 
cost of services as a percent of revenue decreased to in  as compared to in this decrease was primarily due to our increase in total revenue discussed above and the changes in operating expenses explained below 
total programming costs for the year ended december   decreased because crown media holdings recorded a charge in the fourth quarter of of million related to certain programming write offs reflecting the refinement of our programming strategy and projected usage 
excluding the effects of this write off  programming costs in rose because of the acquisition of programming for our domestic and united kingdom channels 
for example  in september  we added three series to our domestic programming schedule mash  matlock and little house on the prairie 
the increase in amortization of film assets was primarily due to increased sales during the full year subscriber acquisition fee expense was million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december   respectively 
as the result of the settlement and amendment of certain contractual matters with us distributors  expense of million was recorded during the fourth quarter of which did not reoccur in operating costs for the year ended december   which include playback  dubbing and subtitling  transponder and interstitial expenses  decreased primarily due to our reorganization and resulting decrease in lower salary and benefit expense of million and lower satellite and transponder expense of million resulting from our reorganization 
subtitling and dubbing expense decreased million due to our exit of certain markets and our decrease in purchases of international programming for our channels in non english speaking countries 
bad debt expense decreased million due to improved collections of receivables primarily in our international markets and a decrease in write offs related to certain foreign accounts that are now accounted for on a cash basis 
in addition  during the year ended december   our revenue from domestic advertising and film licensing grew at a significantly higher rate than revenue from international sources and our collection rate on domestic advertising and film licensing has historically been better than international sales 
selling  general and administrative expense 
we recorded compensation expense of million related to our rsus during additionally  expenses for dues and publications  investor relations  bank fees and non income taxes declined during selling  general and administrative expense as a percentage of total revenue decreased to for  as compared to for this percentage decrease was also due to the increase in total revenue noted above 
depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended december   decreased to million from million for the year ended december   which represents a decrease of  or  for the year 
depreciation and amortization expense was higher for the year ended december   because of the million write down of certain impaired fixed assets during the fourth quarter of depreciation and amortization expense in also included the amortization of additional expenditures in our network operation center to accommodate the launch of our domestic channel in the first quarter of and our new domestic and international channel websites being placed into service during marketing expense 
marketing expenses were higher in due to the amplified efforts to promote the premieres of adoption  stranded and johnson county wars on our domestic channel 
additionally  our fourth quarter of holiday campaign with hallmark cards resulted in million of expense as compared to the million hallmark keepsake sweepstakes expense in the fourth quarter of reorganization expense 
during the fourth quarter of  the company settled certain contracts related to transponder leases and revised certain estimates of when our excess capacity under our transponder leases will be sublet 
these settlements and revisions in estimates resulted in a net reversal of reorganization expense of million 
reorganization expense for the year ended december   was comprised of a charge of million for severance costs and charges of million related to satellite and facility exit costs 
loss from operations 
loss from operations for the year ended december   was million  which was comprised of a loss from operations of our domestic segment of million  a loss from operations of our international segment of million  and a loss from operations of our film distribution segment of million 
loss from operations for the year ended december   was million  which was comprised of a loss from operations of our domestic segment of million  a loss from operations of our international segment of million  and a loss from operations of our film distribution segment of million 
the decrease in the loss from our domestic operations were primarily due to the increase in advertising revenue and the settlement of certain contractual matters with our domestic distributors in the decrease in the loss from our international operations is due to the reorganization expense of million recorded in the fourth quarter  as well as the related decrease in headcount and the decrease in transponder lease expense in the decrease in the loss from our film distribution segment was a result of higher sales 
loss from early extinguishment of debt 
loss from early extinguishment of debt was million for the year ended december   and resulted from the loss associated with the repurchase of the trust preferred securities and contingent appreciation certificates on august  guaranteed preferred beneficial interest accretion 
this expense related to future obligations on our debentures issued on december   in connection with the trust preferred securities of crown media trust 
included in the expense is a gain of million  due to the revaluing of our derivative liabilities to fair value for the year ended december  the expense only included guaranteed preferred beneficial interest accretion for a partial year due to the repurchase of our preferred securities on august  interest expense 
interest expense increased in compared to by million 
this increase was primarily due to additional interest on our increased borrowings under our bank credit facility of million  the additional interest on our hc crown line of credit of million  interest on our senior unsecured note payable commencing august   and amounting to million in  accretion of our preferred minority interest of million in  and an increase in the accretion related to certain discounted liabilities arising from the reorganization of  income tax provision 
the income tax provision for the year ended december   increased by million due to an increase in taxes on the foreign income resulting from higher international film licensing fee revenue 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle was a million gain for each of the year ended december  this gain was due to the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity  on july  and the requirement to remeasure at fair value the company obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred interest issued to visn in year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue 
the increase in subscriber fee revenue resulted from expanded worldwide distribution offset by reduced license fee rates and increased subscriber acquisition fees in the united states 
subscribers to our service increased at a higher rate than subscriber fee revenue due to a number of factors such as adding new subscribers with free promotional periods  initial discounted subscriber fees  waiver of subscriber fees and bulk discounts from attaining certain subscriber levels 
eighty percent of subscriber fee revenue for the year ended december   and of subscriber fee revenue for the year ended december   were earned internationally 
the amount of subscriber fee revenue net of the subscriber acquisition fee expense was million for the domestic hallmark channel for the year ended december   and million for the international hallmark channel for the year ended december  the increase in advertising revenue reflects the following during our growth in both domestic and international subscribers  higher ratings in the united states and in the united kingdom  higher advertising rates and expanded sales of advertising time primarily in the united states 
advertising revenue from our domestic channel was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  additionally  the number of advertisers on our domestic channel rose from approximately in december to approximately in the december during the fourth quarter of  due to attainment of a contractual maximum  the amount of advertising revenue for our united kingdom market substantially decreased 
during the fourth quarter of  we began earning film licensing fees revenue from our purchased film assets 
the level of licensing fees in reflected what we believed to be a temporary soft demand in the international market for our film products because of a worldwide downward correction in prices and an oversupply of television programming 
cost of services 
cost of services as a percent of revenue decreased to for the year ended december   as compared to for the year ended this decrease was primarily due to our increase in revenue discussed above  offset by the effect of increased programming and other costs discussed in the two paragraphs below 
total programming costs for the year ended december   increased as crown media holdings recorded a charge in the fourth quarter of million related to certain programming write offs described above 
in the third quarter of  the company recorded a charge of million related to the write down of certain programming contracts with em 
tv and the jim henson company  also reflecting refinement of our programming strategy and projected usage 
for the year ended december   amortization of our film assets increased because of increased sales 
expanded distribution and new agreements in the us resulted in an increase in subscriber acquisition fee expense for the year ended december   as compared to the same period of as the result of the settlement and adjustment of certain contractual matters with us distributors  expense of million was recorded during the fourth quarter of operating costs for the year ended december   which include playback  dubbing and subtitling  transponder and interstitial expenses  increased primarily as a result of the million write down of certain subtitling and dubbing costs in our international market 
bad debt expense remained approximately the same for the year ended december   as compared to the same period of due to improved collections of receivables  decreased write offs related to our international customers and the use of a cash basis for certain foreign accounts 
in addition  during the year ended december   our revenue from domestic advertising and film licensing grew at a significantly higher rate than revenue from international sources and our collection rate on domestic advertising and film licensing has historically been better than international sales 
selling  general and administrative expense 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expense for the year ended december   over the comparable period in resulted from a reduction in salary  benefit and travel expenses 
salary and benefit expenses declined as a result of the termination of certain high level positions during our continuing use of teleconferencing  changes to our travel policy  and an overall decrease in international travel lowered travel expenses 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expense was partially due to the increase in total revenue of noted above 
depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended december   increased to million from million  which represents an increase of million  or  over the comparable period in depreciation and amortization expense was higher for the year ended december   due primarily to the million write down of certain impaired fixed assets during the fourth quarter of marketing expense

equity in net losses of unconsolidated entities and for the two and one half months ended march   was  we acquired the remaining common interests in crown media united states and h h programming asia on march  guaranteed preferred beneficial accretion 
guaranteed preferred beneficial accretion for the year ended december   was million as compared to million in this expense relates to future payments on our debentures issued on december   in connection with the trust preferred securities of crown media trust

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we only invest in instruments that meet high credit and quality standards  as specified in our investment policy guidelines 
these instruments  like all fixed income instruments  are subject to interest rate risk 
the fixed income portfolio will decline in value if there is an increase in interest rates 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels as of december   the decline of the fair value of the fixed income portfolio would not be material 
as of december   our cash  restricted cash  cash equivalents and short term investments had a fair value of million  which was invested in cash and short term commercial paper 
the primary purpose of these investing activities has been to preserve principal until the cash is required to fund operations 
consequently  the size of this portfolio fluctuates significantly as cash is provided by and used in our business 
the value of certain investments in this portfolio can be impacted by the risk of adverse changes in securities and economic markets and interest rate fluctuations 
at december   all of our investments in this category were in fixed rate instruments or money market type accounts 
a decrease in interest rates has the effect of reducing our future annual interest income from this portfolio  since funds would be reinvested at lower rates as the instruments mature 
over time  any net percentage decrease in our interest rates could be reflected in a corresponding net percentage decrease in our interest income 
for the year ended december   the impact of interest rate fluctuations  changed business prospects and all other factors did not have a material impact on the fair value of this portfolio  or on our income derived from this portfolio 
we have not used derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
as of december   we are not hedged or otherwise protected against risks associated with any of our investing or financing activities 
we are exposed to market risk 
we are exposed to market risk  including changes to interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and equity investment prices 
to reduce the volatility relating to these exposures  we may enter into various derivative investment transactions in the near term pursuant to our investment and risk management policies and procedures in areas such as hedging and counterparty exposure practices 
we have not and will not use derivatives for speculative purposes 
though we intend to use risk management control policies  there will be inherent risks that may only be partially offset by our hedging programs should there be any unfavorable movements in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates or equity investment prices 
the estimated exposure discussed below is intended to measure the maximum amount we could lose from adverse market movements in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and equity investment prices  given a specified confidence level  over a given period of time 
loss is defined in the value at risk estimation as fair market value loss 
our interest income and expense is subject to fluctuations in interest rates and the price of our class a common stock 
our material interest bearing assets consisted of cash equivalents  restricted cash  and short term investments 
the balance of our interest bearing assets was million  or less than of total assets  as of december  our material liabilities subject to interest rate risk consisted of a capital lease obligation  our bank credit facility  our line of credit with hc crown and our note payable to hc crown 
the balance of those liabilities was million  or of total liabilities  as of december  net interest expense for the year ended december   was million   of our total revenue 
our net interest expense of these liabilities is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates  primarily us and libor interest rates 
in this regard  changes in us and libor interest rates affect the fair value of interest bearing liabilities 
we are exposed to risks relating to foreign currency exchange rates and foreign economic conditions 
we evaluate our foreign currency exposure on a net basis 
we receive subscriber fees and advertising revenue from countries throughout the world 
increasingly  however  expenses arising from our foreign facilities as well as non us denominated dollar expenses are offsetting these revenues 
generally  payments required under our agreements are denominated in us dollars and  therefore  unaffected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
we have some exposure to changes in exchange rates in latin america  europe  asia  and africa 
however  our exposure to foreign exchange rates primarily exists with the british pound 
when the us dollar strengthens against the currencies in these countries  the us dollar value of non us dollar denominated revenue decreases  when the non us dollar weakens  the us dollar value of us dollar denominated revenue increases 
accordingly  changes in exchange rates  and in particular  a strengthening of the us dollar  may adversely affect our revenue as expressed in us dollars
