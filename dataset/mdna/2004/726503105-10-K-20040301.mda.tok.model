item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of our operations should be read in conjunction with our historical consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
for more detailed information regarding the basis of presentation for the following financial information  see the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
overview plains all american pipeline  lp is a delaware limited partnership the partnership formed in september of see items and business and properties organizational history 
our operations are conducted directly and indirectly through our operating subsidiaries  plains marketing  lp  plains pipeline  lp and plains marketing canada  lp we are engaged in interstate and intrastate crude oil transportation  and crude oil gathering  marketing  terminalling and storage  as well as the marketing and storage of liquefied petroleum gas and other petroleum products 
we refer to liquified petroleum gas and other petroleum products collectively as lpg 
we own an extensive network in the united states and canada of pipeline transportation  terminalling  storage and gathering assets in key oil producing basins and at major market hubs 
in order to better understand the financial statements discussed herein  it is important to understand the basic nature of our two operating segments as well as the magnitude of the impact of our acquisition program from inception 
our operations are conducted primarily in texas  oklahoma  california  louisiana and the canadian provinces of alberta and saskatchewan and consist of two operating segments i pipeline operations and ii gathering  marketing  terminalling and storage operations g  m  t s 
our revenues from pipeline operations generally derive from the transportation of crude oil for a fee and leases of pipeline capacity to third parties  as well as from barrel exchanges and buy sell arrangements 
our revenues from gathering and marketing activities reflect the sale of gathered and bulk purchased crude oil and lpg plus the sale of additional barrels through buy sell arrangements entered into to enhance the margins of the gathered and bulk purchased volumes 
we discuss the fundamental drivers of each of these operating segments in greater detail below under analysis of operating segments 
the significant impact of our acquisition program on our reported financial results is discussed under acquisitions immediately below 
acquisitions we completed a number of acquisitions in  and that have impacted the results of operations and liquidity discussed herein 
the following acquisitions were accounted for  and the purchase price was allocated  in accordance with the purchase method of accounting 
we adopted sfas no 
 business combinations in and followed the provisions of that statement for all business combinations initiated after june  our ongoing acquisition activity is discussed further in liquidity and capital resources below 
acquisitions during  we completed ten acquisitions for aggregate consideration of approximately million 
the aggregate consideration includes cash paid  estimated transaction costs  assumed liabilities and estimated near term capital costs 
the acquisitions were initially financed with borrowings under our credit facilities  which were subsequently repaid with a portion of the proceeds from our equity issuances and the issuance of senior notes 
see liquidity and capital resources 
the businesses acquired during impacted our results of operations subsequent to the effective date of each acquisition as indicated below 
these acquisitions included mainline crude oil pipelines  crude oil gathering lines  terminal and storage facilities  and an underground lpg storage facility 
with the exception of million that was allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets and million associated with crude oil linefill and working inventory  the remaining aggregate purchase price was allocated to property and equipment

on august   we acquired interests in approximately  miles of gathering and mainline crude oil pipelines and approximately million barrels net to our interest of above ground crude oil terminalling and storage assets in west texas from shell pipeline company lp and equilon enterprises llc the shell acquisition for approximately million 
the primary assets included in the transaction are interests in the basin pipeline system  the permian basin gathering system and the rancho pipeline system 
the entire purchase price was allocated to property and equipment 
the acquired assets are primarily fee based mainline crude oil pipeline transportation assets that gather crude oil in the permian basin and transport the crude oil to major market locations in the mid continent and gulf coast regions 
the permian basin has long been one of the most stable crude oil producing regions in the united states  dating back to the s 
the acquired assets complement our existing asset infrastructure in west texas and represent a transportation link to cushing  oklahoma  where we provide storage and terminalling services 
in addition  we believe that the basin pipeline system is poised to benefit from potential shut downs of refineries and other pipelines due to the shifting market dynamics in the west texas area 
the rancho pipeline system was taken out of service in march  pursuant to the operating agreement 
see items and business and properties acquisitions and dispositions shutdown and partial sale of rancho pipeline system 
for more information on this transaction  as well as historical financial information on the businesses acquired and pro forma financial information reflecting the acquisition of the businesses  please refer to our form k dated august   which was filed with the securities and exchange commission 
other acquisitions 
during february and march of  we completed two other acquisitions for aggregate consideration totaling million  with effective dates of february  and march   respectively 
these acquisitions include an equity interest in a crude oil pipeline company and crude oil gathering and marketing assets 
acquisitions canpet energy group 
in july  we acquired the assets of canpet energy group inc  a calgary based canadian crude oil and lpg marketing company the canpet acquisition  for approximately million plus excess inventory at the closing date of approximately million 
a portion of the purchase price  payable in common units or cash  at our option  was deferred subject to various performance standards being met 
as of december   we determined that it was beyond a reasonable doubt that the performance standards were met and we recorded additional consideration of million  see note partners capital and distributions in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  resulting in aggregate consideration of approximately million 
the deferred consideration was recorded as goodwill 
at the time of the acquisition  canpet s activities consisted of gathering approximately  barrels per day of crude oil and marketing an average of approximately  barrels per day of natural gas liquids or lpgs 
the principal assets acquired include a crude oil handling facility  a  barrel tank facility  lpg facilities  existing business relationships and operating inventory 
the acquired assets are part of our strategy to establish a canadian operation that complements our operations in the united states 
the purchase price  as adjusted post closing  was allocated as follows in millions inventory goodwill intangible assets contracts pipeline linefill crude oil gathering  terminalling and other assets total murphy oil company ltd 
midstream operations 
in may  we completed the acquisition of substantially all of the canadian crude oil pipeline  gathering  storage and terminalling assets of murphy oil company ltd 
for approximately million in cash after post closing adjustments  including financing and transaction costs the murphy acquisition 
initial financing for the acquisition was provided through borrowings under our credit facilities 
the purchase price included million for excess inventory in the pipeline systems 
the principal assets acquired include approximately miles of crude oil and condensate mainlines including dual lines on which condensate is shipped for blending purposes and blended crude is shipped in the opposite direction and associated gathering and lateral lines  approximately million barrels of crude oil storage and terminalling capacity located primarily in kerrobert  saskatchewan  approximately  barrels of pipeline linefill and tank inventories  and trailers used primarily for crude oil transportation 
the acquired assets are part of our strategy to establish a canadian operation that complements our operations in the united states 
murphy agreed to continue to transport production from fields previously delivering crude oil to these pipeline systems  under a long term contract 
at the time of acquisition  these volumes averaged approximately  barrels per day 
total volumes transported on the pipeline system in were approximately  barrels per day of light  medium and heavy crudes  as well as condensate 
the purchase price  as adjusted post closing  was allocated as follows in millions crude oil pipeline  gathering and terminal assets pipeline linefill net working capital items other property and equipment other assets  including debt issue costs total other acquisitions 
in december  we consummated the acquisition of the wapella pipeline system from private investors for approximately million  including transaction costs 
the entire purchase price was allocated to property and equipment 
the system further expands our market in canada 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  at the date of the financial statements 
such estimates and assumptions also affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
although we believe these estimates are reasonable  actual results could differ from these estimates 
the critical accounting policies that we have identified are discussed below 
depreciation  amortization and impairment of long lived assets we calculate our depreciation and amortization based on estimated useful lives and salvage values of our assets 
when assets are put into service  we make estimates with respect to useful lives that we believe are reasonable 
however  subsequent events could cause us to change our estimates  thus impacting the future calculation of depreciation and amortization 
additionally  we assess our long lived assets for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
such indicators include changes in our business plans  a change in the extent or manner in which a long lived asset is being used or in its physical condition  or a current expectation that  more likely than not  a long lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
if the carrying value of an asset exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows expected from the asset  an impairment charge would be recorded for the excess of the carrying value of the asset over its fair value 
determination as to whether and how much an asset is impaired would necessarily involve numerous management estimates 
any impairment reviews and calculations would be based on assumptions that are consistent with our business plans and long term investment decisions 
allowance for doubtful trade accounts receivable the majority of our trade accounts receivable relate to our gathering and marketing activities and can generally be described as high volume and low margin activities 
we routinely review our trade accounts receivable balances to identify past due amounts and analyze the reasons such amounts have not been collected 
in many instances  such uncollected amounts involve billing delays and discrepancies or disputes as to the appropriate price  volumes or quality of crude oil delivered  received or exchanged 
we also attempt to monitor changes in the creditworthiness of our customers as a result of developments related to each customer  the industry as a whole and the general economy 
based on these analyses  we have established an allowance for doubtful trade accounts receivable and consider the reserve adequate  however  there is no assurance that actual amounts will not vary significantly from estimated amounts 
purchase and sales accruals we routinely make accruals for both purchases and sales due to the timing of compiling billing information  receiving third party information and reconciling our records with those of third parties 
in situations where we are required to make mark to market estimates pursuant to sfas  the estimates of gains or losses at a particular period end do not reflect the end results of particular transactions  and will most likely not reflect the actual gain or loss at the conclusion of a transaction 
we reflect estimates for these items based on our internal records and information from third parties 
a portion of the estimates we use are based on internal models or models of third parties because they are not quoted on a national market 
additionally  values may vary among different models and may not be reflective of the price at which they can be settled due to the lack of a liquid market 
less than of total revenues are based on estimates derived from these models 
we believe our estimates for these items are reasonable  but there is no assurance that actual amounts will not vary significantly from estimated amounts 
liability and contingency accruals we accrue reserves for contingent liabilities including  but not limited to  environmental remediation  insurance claims and potential legal claims 
accruals are made when our assessment indicates that it is probable that a liability has occurred and the amount of liability can be reasonably estimated 
our estimates are based on all known facts at the time and our assessment of the ultimate outcome 
these estimates will be increased or decreased as additional information is obtained or resolution is achieved 
we also make accruals for potential payments under our long term incentive plan ltip when we determine that vesting of the units is probable 
the aggregate amount of the actual charge to expense will be determined by the unit price on the date vesting occurs or  in some cases  the average unit price for a range of dates multiplied by the number of units  plus our share of associated employment taxes 
we believe our estimates for these items are reasonable  but there is no assurance that actual amounts will not vary significantly from estimated amounts 
determination of fair value of assets and liabilities acquired and identification of associated goodwill and intangible assets in conjunction with each acquisition  we must allocate the cost of the acquired entity to the assets and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 
we also estimate the amount of transaction costs that will be incurred in connection with each acquisition 
as additional information becomes available  we may adjust the original estimates within a short time period subsequent to the acquisition 
in addition  in conjunction with the adoption of sfas  we are required to recognize intangible assets separately from goodwill 
goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but instead are periodically assessed for impairment 
the impairment testing entails estimating future net cash flows relating to the asset  based on management s estimate of market conditions including pricing  demand  competition  operating costs and other factors 
intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over the estimated useful life determined by management 
determining the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired  as well as intangible assets that relate to such items as relationships  contracts  and industry expertise involves professional judgment and is ultimately based on acquisition models and management s assessment of the value of the assets acquired 
we believe our estimates for these items are reasonable  but there is no assurance that actual amounts will not vary significantly from estimated amounts 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
asset retirement obligations 
sfas establishes accounting requirements for retirement obligations associated with tangible long lived assets  including the time of the liability recognition  initial measurement of the liability  allocation of asset retirement cost to expense  subsequent measurement of the liability and financial statement disclosures 
sfas requires that the cost for asset retirement should be capitalized as part of the cost of the related long lived asset and subsequently allocated to expense using a systematic and rational method 
effective january   we adopted sfas  as required 
determination of the amounts to be recognized upon adoption is based upon numerous estimates and assumptions  including future retirement costs  future inflation rates and the credit adjusted risk free interest rate 
the majority of our assets  primarily related to our pipeline operations segment  have obligations to perform remediation and  in some instances  removal activities when the asset is abandoned 
however  the fair value of the asset retirement obligations cannot be reasonably estimated  as the settlement dates are indeterminate 
we will record such asset retirement obligations in the period in which we can reasonably determine the settlement dates 
results of operations summary of three years ended december  our operations consist of two operating segments our pipeline operations  through which we engage in interstate and intrastate crude oil pipeline transportation and certain related margin activities  and our gathering  marketing  terminalling and storage operations  through which we engage in purchases and resales of crude oil and lpg at various points along the distribution chain and the operation of certain terminalling and storage assets 
for the year ended december   we reported consolidated net income of million on total revenues of billion compared to net income for the same period in and of million and million on total revenues of billion and billion  respectively 
included in the results of operations for  and are certain items that impact the comparability between periods  which are discussed further below 
excluding these items  our operating results reflect year over year growth in both our pipeline operations segment and our gathering  marketing  terminalling and storage operations segment 
the growth reflects the impact on our operations of the acquisition and integration of the businesses discussed above  as well as  the successful completion of various capital expansion projects 
items impacting comparability during the first quarter of  new securities and exchange commission regulations regarding the use of non gaap financial measures became effective 
as a result of our efforts to comply with these new regulations  we have made certain changes to the content and presentation of information in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
internally  we consider in our analysis of operating results the impact of items that we believe impact comparability between periods  however  to comply with the new regulations  we have omitted certain adjustments and reconciliations related to these items that have been presented in the past 
we have also changed the format of certain tables presented in the discussion of our results of operations 
in addition  certain reclassifications have been made to the prior period presentations to conform to current period presentation 
where appropriate  we have noted that reported results include the effects of items we consider to impact comparability between periods 
overall  we believe the discussion and presentation provides an accurate and thorough analysis of our results of operations and financial condition 
additionally  we maintain on our website www 
paalp 
com a reconciliation of all non gaap financial information in our earnings releases and other communications with security holders to the most comparable gaap measures 
to access the information  investors should click on the investor relations header at the top of our home page and then click on the non gaap reconciliation section on the investor relations page 
the following is a summary of items that we believe impact comparability between periods and that we consider separately when we evaluate our results for performance against expectations  public guidance and trend analysis 
following that summary is a more detailed discussion of the results of operations of each segment 
the items discussed below are included in net income in the period indicated and impact the comparability between periods as shown year ended december  in millions items impacting comparability noncash sfas adjustment ltip charge loss on refinancing of debt write off of deferred acquisition related costs noncash reserve for potential environmental obligations noncash mark to market inventory charge noncash compensation expense noncash reserve for doubtful accounts gain on sales of assets noncash cumulative effect of accounting change total of items impacting comparability the following is a discussion of each of the items that impacted our results of operations 
further discussion of each of the items impacting comparability for the three years ended december   is included in the applicable portion of the results of operations discussion 
noncash statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities adjustment sfas requires that changes in derivative instruments fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met  in which case  changes in fair value are deferred to other comprehensive income  or oci  and reclassified into earnings when the underlying transaction affects earnings 
accordingly  changes in fair value are included in the current period for i derivatives characterized as fair value hedges  ii derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting and iii the portion of cash flow hedges that is not highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged items 
the majority of instruments we are required to mark to market at the end of each quarterly period pursuant to sfas nonetheless serve as economic hedges that offset future physical positions not reflected in current results 
therefore  we believe mark to market adjustments to net income required under sfas do not provide a complete depiction of the economic substance of the transaction  as it only represents the derivative side of these transactions and does not take into account the offsetting physical position 
in addition  the impact will vary from quarter to quarter based on market prices at the end of the quarter  which are impossible for us to control or forecast  and the sfas adjustments will reverse in future periods 
accordingly  when we evaluate our results internally for performance against expectations  public guidance and trend analysis  we exclude the non cash  mark to market impact of sfas we present the impact of the sfas adjustments because we believe such amounts affect the comparison of the fundamental operating results for the periods presented 
we reported sfas gains of million  million and million  for the three years ending december   respectively 
such annual amounts vary by only approximately million per year between consecutive periods compared to and compared to 
however  in the eight quarterly comparisons within those three years four quarters of compared to four quarters of  then four quarters of compared to four quarters of  variances were million or higher in seven of the eight comparable quarterly periods and ranged as high as million 
eg  the first quarter of compared to and the first quarter of compared to 
management believes such quarterly variances underscore the importance of highlighting the impact of these mark to market adjustments 
long term incentive plan charge under generally accepted accounting principles  we are required to recognize an expense when vesting of ltip units becomes probable as determined by management at the end of the period 
our results of operations include a charge of million in the year ended december  see outlook ltip vesting and note long term incentive plans in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
loss on refinancing of debt during the fourth quarter of we completed the refinancing of our bank credit facilities with new senior unsecured credit facilities totaling million and a million uncommitted facility for the purchase of hedged crude oil see other income and expenses other 
in addition  during the third quarter of we made a million prepayment on our senior secured term b loan in anticipation of the refinancing 
the completion of these transactions resulted in a non cash charge of approximately million associated with the write off of unamortized debt issue costs 
additional items impacting comparability our results of operations also include charges of million related to the write off of deferred acquisition related costs see other income and expenses unallocated g a expenses and a noncash charge of million associated with the establishment of a reserve for environmental obligations see pipeline operations segment margin 
additional items impacting comparability our results of operations also include i a million noncash writedown of operating crude oil inventory in the fourth quarter of see note summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements  ii a million noncash charge related to incentive compensation see other expenses unallocated g a expenses  iii a million reserve for receivables  iv a million gain on sale of assets and v a noncash gain as a cumulative effect of accounting change resulting from the adoption of sfas analysis of operating segments we evaluate segment performance based on i segment margin revenues less purchases and operating expenses  ii segment profit segment margin less general and administrative g a expenses and iii maintenance capital 
maintenance capital consists of capital expenditures required either to maintain the existing operating capacity of partially or fully depreciated assets or to extend their useful lives 
capital expenditures made to expand our existing capacity  whether through construction or acquisition  are not considered maintenance capital expenditures 
repair and maintenance expenditures associated with existing assets that do not extend the useful life or expand the operating capacity are charged to expense as incurred

the proportional allocations by segment require judgement by management and will continue to be based on the business activities that exist during each period 
amounts related to sfas are included in revenues and impact segment margin and segment profit 
pipeline operations as of december   we owned and operated approximately  miles of gathering and mainline crude oil pipelines located throughout the united states and canada 
our activities from pipeline operations generally consist of transporting volumes of crude oil for a fee and third party leases of pipeline capacity collectively referred to as tariff activities  as well as barrel exchanges and buy sell arrangements collectively referred to as pipeline margin activities 
in connection with certain of our merchant activities conducted under our gathering and marketing business  we are also shippers on certain of our own pipelines 
these transactions are conducted at published tariff rates and eliminated in consolidation 
tariffs and other fees on our pipeline systems vary by receipt point and delivery point 
the segment margin generated by our tariff and other fee related activities depends on the volumes transported on the pipeline and the level of the tariff and other fees charged as well as the fixed and variable costs of operating the pipeline 
segment margin from our pipeline capacity leases  barrel exchanges and buy sell arrangements generally reflect a negotiated amount 
the following table sets forth our operating results from our pipeline operations segment for the periods indicated year ended december  operating results in millions revenues tariff activities pipeline margin activities total pipeline operations revenues costs and expenses pipeline margin activities purchases operating expenses excluding ltip charge ltip charge operations segment margin general and administrative expenses excluding ltip charge ltip charge general and administrative segment profit maintenance capital average daily volumes thousands of barrels per day tariff activities all american basin other domestic canada total tariff activities pipeline margin activities total revenues and purchases include intersegment amounts 
g a expenses reflect direct costs attributable to each segment and an allocation of other expenses to the segments based on the business activities that existed at that time 
the proportional allocations by segment require judgment by management and will continue to be based on the business activities that exist during each period 
volumes associated with acquisitions represent weighted average daily amounts for the number of days we actually owned the assets over the total days in the period 
prior period volumes have been adjusted for consistency of comparison between years 
total average daily volumes transported were approximately  barrels per day for the year ended december   compared to  barrels per day and  barrels per day for the years ended december  and  respectively 
as discussed above  we have completed a number of acquisitions during and that have impacted the results of operations herein 
the following table reflects our total average daily volumes from our tariff activities by year of acquisition for comparison purposes year ended december  thousands of barrels per day tariff activities acquisitions acquisitions acquisitions all other pipeline systems total tariff activities average daily volumes volumes associated with acquisitions represent weighted average daily amounts for the number of days we actually owned the assets over the total days in the period 
prior period volumes have been adjusted for consistency of comparison between years 
the increase in average daily volumes from our tariff activities to  barrels per day in from  barrels per day and  barrels per day in and  respectively  resulted primarily from our acquisition activities discussed above 
the following discussion explains year to year variances based on the comparison of volumes in the table above 
acquisitions approximately  barrels per day of the increase in volumes over volumes is related to systems acquired during acquisitions an additional  barrels per day of the increase in resulted from the inclusion of assets acquired in for the entire year in as compared to only a portion of the assets acquired in the shell acquisition accounted for  barrels per day of this increase as increased barrels per day on the basin pipeline system and the permian basin gathering system coupled with the impact of including a full year results in as compared to only five months in more than offset the decrease in barrels per day resulting from the shut down of the rancho pipeline system see items and business and properties acquisitions and dispositions shutdown and partial sale of rancho pipeline system 
acquisitions in addition  volumes on pipeline systems acquired in increased by approximately  barrels per day in the period as canadian volumes benefited from the completion of capital expansion projects that allowed for additional volumes on certain pipelines 
barrels per day on these systems increased in the period as compared to the period primarily due to the inclusion of the murphy acquisition for a full year in compared to only a portion of the year in all other pipeline systems volumes on all other pipeline systems decreased approximately  barrels per day primarily because of a  barrel per day decrease in our all american tariff volumes and various other decreases totaling  barrels per day on several of our pipeline systems 
the decrease in all american tariff volumes is attributable to a decline in california outer continental shelf ocs production 
partially offsetting these decreases was an  barrel per day increase in our west texas gathering system volumes 
our west texas gathering system has benefited from the shutdown of the rancho pipeline and also from temporary refinery problems that have diverted crude oil barrels from other systems 
volumes on all other pipeline systems decreased by approximately  barrels per day in as compared to  primarily because of an approximate  barrel per day decrease in our all american tariff volumes and a  barrel per day decrease in our west texas gathering system volumes 
revenues total revenues from our pipeline operations were approximately million for the year ended december   compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in revenues was primarily related to our pipeline margin activities  which increased by approximately million in this increase was related to higher average crude oil prices coupled with increased volumes on our buy sell arrangements on our san joaquin valley gathering system in however  this business is a margin business and although revenues and cost of sales are impacted by the absolute level of crude oil prices  there is a limited impact on segment margin 
the increase in over also was primarily related to our pipeline margin activities on our san joaquin valley gathering system 
increased volumes and higher average prices on our buy sell arrangements were the primary drivers of the increase 
revenues from our tariff activities increased approximately or million in as compared to the following table reflects revenues from our tariff activities by year of acquisition for comparison purposes year ended december  in millions tariff activities revenues acquisitions acquisitions acquisitions all other pipeline systems total tariff activities revenues include intersegment amounts 
the increase in revenues from our tariff activities to million in from million and million in and  respectively  resulted predominantly from our acquisition activities discussed above 
the following discussion explains year to year variances based on the comparison of revenues in the table above 
acquisitions approximately million of the increase in revenues over revenues is related to systems acquired during acquisitions an additional million of the increase in revenues from our tariff activities resulted from the inclusion of assets acquired in for the entire year in as compared to only a portion of this increase was entirely related to the assets acquired in the shell acquisition as increased revenues on the basin pipeline system and the permian basin gathering system coupled with the impact of including a full year results in as compared to only five months in more than offset the decrease in revenues resulting from the shut down of the rancho pipeline system see items and business and properties acquisitions and dispositions shutdown and partial sale of rancho pipeline system 
acquisitions in addition  revenues from acquisitions increased approximately million in as compared to this increase predominately resulted from increased canadian revenues of million in the period primarily due to expanded capacity  higher tariffs and a million favorable exchange rate impact 
the favorable exchange rate impact has resulted from a decrease in the canadian dollar to us dollar exchange rate to an average rate of to for the year ended december   from an average rate of to for the year ended december  revenues from these systems increased to million in from million in primarily because of the inclusion of the murphy acquisition for a full year in and increases in the tariff of certain pipeline systems acquired in the murphy acquisition 
all other pipeline systems revenues from all other pipeline systems were relatively flat for all of the comparable periods as the decrease in volumes attributable to ocs production on our all american system on which we receive the highest per barrel tariffs among our pipeline operations was offset in each period by other increases  including increases in the tariffs for ocs volumes transported 
segment margin our pipeline operations segment margin increased to approximately million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  pipeline segment margin was approximately million in the primary reasons for the increase in segment margin are discussed above and are also impacted by an increase in operating expenses to million in from million and million in and  respectively 
the increase in expenses includes million related to the accrual made for the probable vesting of unit grants under our ltip and approximately million related to a pipeline spill in mississippi 
the remaining increase is predominately related to our continued growth  primarily from acquisitions  coupled with higher utility costs 
in addition  segment margin includes a million favorable impact resulting from the decrease in the average canadian dollar to us dollar exchange rate for the period as compared to the period 
the increase in operating expenses in as compared to was primarily related to the acquisition of businesses in and late and the inclusion of the results of the murphy acquisition for all of compared to only a portion of our operating expense for the period also includes a million noncash charge associated with the establishment of a liability for potential cleanup of environmental conditions associated with our acquisitions  based on additional information 
this amount is approximately equal to the threshold amounts we must incur before the sellers indemnities take effect 
in many cases  the actual cash expenditure may not occur for ten years or more 
segment profit g a expenses were approximately million in  compared to approximately million and million in and  respectively 
the increase in is primarily a result of a million accrual related to the probable vesting of unit grants under our ltip 
additionally  the percentage of indirect costs allocated to the pipeline operations segment has increased in as our pipeline operations have grown 
including the impact of the items discussed above  segment profit was approximately million for the year ended december   an increase of as compared to the million reported for the year ended december  segment profit includes a million favorable impact resulting from the decrease in the average canadian dollar to us dollar exchange rate for the period as compared to the period 
the increase in g a expenses in as compared to was partially due to increased costs from the assets acquired in the murphy acquisition related to the inclusion of these assets for all of compared to only a portion of maintenance capital for the periods ended december   and  maintenance capital expenditures were approximately million  million and million  respectively for our pipeline operations segment 
the increases between the years are related to our continued growth  primarily through acquisitions 
gathering  marketing  terminalling and storage operations our revenues from gathering and marketing activities reflect the sale of gathered and bulk purchased crude oil and lpg plus the sale of additional barrels exchanged through buy sell arrangements entered into to enhance the margins of the gathered and bulk purchased volumes 
segment margin from our gathering and marketing activities is dependent on our ability to sell crude oil and lpg at a price in excess of our aggregate cost 
these operations are margin businesses and are not directly affected by the absolute level of prices  but are affected by overall levels of supply and demand for crude oil and lpg and fluctuations in market related indices 
accordingly  an increase or decrease in revenues is not necessarily an indication of segment performance 
we own and operate approximately million barrels of above ground crude oil terminalling and storage facilities  including a crude oil terminalling and storage facility at cushing  oklahoma 
cushing  which we refer to as the cushing interchange  is one of the largest crude oil market hubs in the united states and the designated delivery point for new york mercantile exchange  or nymex  crude oil futures contracts 
terminals are facilities where crude oil is transferred to or from storage or a transportation system  such as a pipeline  to another transportation system  such as trucks or another pipeline 
the operation of these facilities is called terminalling 
approximately million barrels of our million barrels of tankage is used primarily in our gathering  marketing  terminalling and storage operations and the balance is used in our pipeline operations segment 
on a stand alone basis  segment margin from terminalling and storage activities is dependent on the throughput of volumes  the volume of crude oil stored and the level of fees generated from our terminalling and storage services 
our terminalling and storage activities are integrated with our gathering and marketing activities and the level of tankage that we allocate for our arbitrage activities and therefore not available for lease to third parties varies throughout crude oil price cycles 
this integration enables us to use our storage tanks in an effort to counter cyclically balance and hedge our gathering and marketing activities 
as a result of completing our phase ii and iii expansions at our cushing facility  total cushing tankage dedicated to our gathering  marketing  terminalling and storage operations was approximately million barrels greater in relative to a portion of such tankage was employed in hedging activities related to our gathering and marketing activities in and the latter portion of during  market conditions were extremely volatile as a confluence of several events caused the nymex benchmark price of crude oil to fluctuate widely with prices ranging from as high as per barrel to as low as per barrel 
for much of the first eight months of  the crude oil market was in steep backwardation 
although the crude oil market was characterized by high absolute prices in the fourth quarter  the average backwardation for the quarter was in line with a normal crude oil market 
these market conditions and volatility  in conjunction with our hedging strategies  enhanced the returns of our gathering and marketing activities 
this was partially offset by the negative impact that the august blackout had on our fourth quarter margins 
in contrast  market conditions during were less favorable as the crude oil market alternated between periods of weak contango and strong backwardation 
in  the market alternated between weak contango and weak backwardation

g a expenses reflect direct costs attributable to each segment and an allocation of other expenses to the segments based on the business activities that existed at that time 
the proportional allocations by segment require judgment by management and will continue to be based on the business activities that exist during each period 
amounts related to sfas are included in revenues and impact segment margin and segment profit 
volumes associated with acquisitions represent weighted averaged daily amounts for the number of days we actually owned the assets over the total days in the period 
prior period volumes have been adjusted for consistency of comparison between years 
the following factors contributed to our growth in segment margin during as compared to the overall counter cyclical balance of our assets and the flexibility embedded in our business strategy  increased tankage available to our gathering and marketing business  increased lease gathering volumes  the backwardated market structure and volatile market conditions  increased sales and higher margins in our lpg activities for the first quarter because of cold weather throughout the us and canada  and appreciation of canadian currency the canadian dollar to us dollar exchange rate appreciated to an average of to for the year ended december   from an average of to for the year ended december  
as discussed above  market conditions were characterized by periods of weak contango and strong backwardation 
although these conditions are generally disadvantageous for our gathering and marketing activities  the market conditions were even less favorable 
these market conditions and increased crude oil lease gathering volumes contributed to the growth in our segment margin in as compared to the increased volumes resulted predominantly from the inclusion of the assets acquired in the canpet acquisition for the entire year in as compared to only a portion of the increase in segment margin was also impacted by decreased operating expenses in the period as compared to the period as discussed further below 
the increase in earnings we realized from the factors discussed above was also impacted by the items listed in the table below year ended december  in millions items impacting comparability of segment margin ltip accrual sfas impact writedown of crude oil operating inventory reserve for doubtful accounts total of items impacting comparability of segment margin operating expenses included in segment margin increased to approximately million in the year ended december  compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in includes the million ltip accrual presented above 
the remaining increase was partially related to our continued growth  primarily from acquisitions  coupled with increased regulatory compliance activities and higher fuel costs 
the decrease in operating expenses in as compared to was primarily related to the inclusion in of a million noncash writedown of operating crude oil inventory and a million noncash reserve for doubtful accounts 
the items discussed above were partially offset by the approximately million net favorable impact on segment margin from the decrease in the canadian dollar to us dollar exchange rate in the period as compared to the period

for the year ended december   we gathered from producers  using our assets or third party assets  approximately  barrels of crude oil per day  compared to  barrels per day and  barrels per day for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in addition  we purchased in bulk  primarily at major trading locations  approximately  barrels of crude oil per day in the period and approximately  barrels per day and  barrels per day in the and periods  respectively 
storage leased to third parties at our cushing facility averaged million barrels per month in compared to an average of million barrels per month and million barrels per month in and  respectively 
cushing terminal throughput volumes averaged approximately  barrels per day for the year ended december   compared to  barrels per day and  barrels per day for the years ended december  and  respectively 
revenues from our gathering  marketing  terminalling and storage operations were approximately billion  billion and billion for the years ended december   and  respectively

maintenance capital for the periods ended december   and  maintenance capital expenditures were approximately million  million and million  respectively for our gathering  marketing  terminalling and storage operations segment 
the decrease in as compared to and is primarily because of a reduction in costs associated with information systems and the replacement of a portion of our fleet 
other income and expenses unallocated g a expenses total g a expenses were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we have included in the above segment discussion the g a expenses for each of these years that were attributable to our segments either directly or by allocation 
during  we were unsuccessful in our pursuit of several sizable acquisition opportunities determined by auction and one negotiated transaction that had advanced nearly to the execution stage when it was abruptly terminated by the seller 
as a result  our results reflect a million charge to g a expenses associated with the third party costs of these unsuccessful transactions 
during  we incurred charges of million that were not attributable to a segment  related to incentive compensation paid to certain officers and key employees of plains resources and its affiliates 
in in connection with our ipo and  plains resources granted certain officers and key employees of the former general partner the right to earn ownership in a portion of our common units owned by it 
these rights provided for vesting over a three year period  subject to distributions being paid on the common and subordinated units 
in connection with the general partner transition in  these rights  as well as grants to directors under our ltip  vested 
this resulted in a charge to our income of approximately million  of which plains resources funded approximately 
approximately million of the charge was noncash and was not allocated to a segment 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense was million for the year ended december   compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in relates primarily to the inclusion of the assets from the shell acquisition for the entire year as compared to a portion of additionally  several acquisitions were completed during the year along with various capital projects 
amortization of debt issue costs was million in  and was essentially unchanged from million in the increase in over consists of approximately million related to the inclusion of assets from the shell acquisition and approximately million related to the inclusion of the assets from the murphy and canpet acquisitions for all of compared to only a portion of the remainder of the increase is related to increased debt issue costs related to the amendment of our credit facilities during and late  the sale of senior notes in september and the completion of various capital projects 
interest expense interest expense was million for the year ended december   compared to million for both of the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in compared to was primarily related to an increase in the average debt balance during the period to approximately million from approximately million in the period  which resulted in additional interest expense of approximately million 
the higher average debt balance was primarily due to the portion of the shell acquisition that was not financed with equity 
this debt was outstanding for all of versus only a portion of also  increased commitment and other fees coupled with lower capitalized interest resulted in approximately million of the increase in the period 
our weighted average interest rate decreased slightly during to versus in  which decreased our interest expense by approximately million 
although the change in our weighted average interest rate was nominal  the change was the net result of various factors that included an increase in the amount of fixed rate  long term debt  long term interest rate hedges and declining short term interest rates 
in mid september  we issued million of ten year bonds bearing a fixed interest rate of 
in the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of  we entered into hedging arrangements to lock in interest rates on approximately million of its floating rate debt 
in addition  the average three month libor rate declined from approximately during to approximately during the net impact of these factors  increased commitment fees and changes in average debt balances decreased the average interest rate by interest expense was relatively flat in the period as compared to due to the impact of higher debt levels and commitment fees offset by lower average interest rates and the capitalization of interest 
the overall increased average debt balance in is due to the portion of the shell acquisition in august which was not financed with the issuance of equity 
during the third quarter of  we issued a million senior secured term b loan  the proceeds of which were used to reduce borrowings under our revolver 
as such  our commitment fees on our revolver increased as they are based on unused availability 
the lower interest rates in are due to a decrease in libor and prime rates in the current year 
in addition  approximately million of interest expense was capitalized during  in conjunction with expansion construction on our cushing terminal compared to approximately million in the period 
other during the fourth quarter of we completed the refinancing of our bank credit facilities with new senior unsecured credit facilities totaling million and a million uncommitted facility for the purchase of hedged crude oil see liquidity and capital resources credit facilities and long term debt 
in addition  during the third quarter of we made a million prepayment on our senior secured term b loan in anticipation of the refinancing 
the completion of these transactions resulted in a non cash charge of approximately million associated with the write off of unamortized debt issue costs 
outlook crude oil and lpg inventory 
we value our crude oil and lpg inventory at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined using an average cost method 
at december  we had approximately million barrels of inventory classified as unhedged operating inventory at a weighted average cost of per barrel 
the lower of cost or market method requires a write down of inventory to the market price at the end of a period in which our weighted average cost exceeds the market price 
this method does not allow a write up of the inventory if the market price subsequently increases 
we did not have an adjustment in this period 
however  future fluctuations in crude oil prices could result in a period end lower of cost or market adjustment 
ongoing acquisition activities 
consistent with our business strategy  we are continuously engaged in discussions with potential sellers regarding the possible purchase by us of midstream crude oil assets 
such acquisition efforts involve participation by us in processes that have been made public  involve a number of potential buyers and are commonly referred to as auction processes  as well as situations where we believe we are the only party or one of a very limited number of potential buyers in negotiations with the potential seller 
these acquisition efforts often involve assets which  if acquired  would have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we are currently involved in advanced discussions with a potential seller regarding the purchase by us of crude oil pipeline  terminalling  storage and gathering and marketing assets for an aggregate purchase price  including assumed liabilities and obligations  ranging from million to million 
such transaction is subject to confirmatory due diligence  negotiation of a mutually acceptable definitive purchase and sale agreement  regulatory approval and approval of both our board of directors and that of the seller 
in connection with our acquisition activities  we routinely incur third party costs  which are capitalized and deferred pending final outcome of the transaction 
deferred costs associated with successful transactions are capitalized as part of the transaction  while deferred costs associated with unsuccessful transactions are expensed at the time of such final determination 
we had a total of approximately million in deferred costs at december  we estimate that our deferred acquisition costs will increase in the first quarter of by approximately million 
we can give no assurance that our current or future acquisition efforts will be successful or that any such acquisition will be completed on terms considered favorable to us 
on december   we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire all of shell pipeline company lp s splc interests in two entities 
the principal assets of the entities are i an approximate undivided joint interest in the capline pipe line system  and ii an approximate undivided joint interest in the capwood pipeline system 
the capline pipeline system is a mile  inch mainline crude oil pipeline originating in st 
james  louisiana  and terminating in patoka  illinois 
the capwood pipeline system is a mile  inch mainline crude oil pipeline originating in patoka  illinois  and terminating in wood river  illinois 
during  average daily volumes on splc s interest in the capline system were  barrels  a decrease from an average of  barrels per day in and  barrels per day in effective december   splc modified its tariff structure in an effort to increase volume shipments on its space 
on a month to month basis  average daily volumes on this system are subject to significant volatility 
our acquisition analysis assumed that the average daily volumes on the pipelines would be between  and  barrels per day  although it is possible that the volumes will decline below those levels 
the total purchase price for the transaction is approximately million approximately million  net of the deposit paid 
we have sufficient immediate availability under our revolving credit facilities to consummate this transaction 
consistent with our financial growth strategy of funding our acquisition growth with a balance of equity and debt  in december  we issued approximately million common units in anticipation of the consummation of this acquisition 
see liquidity and capital resources liquidity 
this acquisition is expected to close during the first quarter of while we believe it is reasonable to expect the acquisition to close in the first quarter of  we can provide no assurance as to when or whether the acquisition will close 
basin expansion 
in february  we announced plans to expand a mile section of the system 
the section to be expanded extends from colorado city  texas to our cushing terminal 
upon the completion of this estimated million expansion  the capacity of this section will increase approximately  from  barrels per day to approximately  barrels per day 
ocs production 
in october plains exploration and production announced that they had received all of the necessary permits to develop a portion of the rocky point structure that is accessible from the point arguello platforms and it appears that they will commence drilling activities in the second quarter of such drilling activities  if successful  are not expected to have a significant impact on pipeline shipments on our all american pipeline system in if successful  such incremental drilling activity could lead to increased volumes on our all american pipeline system in future periods 
however  we can give no assurances that our volumes transported would increase as a result of this drilling activity 
conversion of subordinated units and ltip vesting 
in november of  of our outstanding subordinated units converted on a one for one basis into common units 
during february  the remaining subordinated units converted 
as a result  distribution rights are now pari passu among all limited partner units 
further  as a result of these conversions  approximately  phantom units granted under our ltip vested in february  and we anticipate that another approximately  phantom units will vest in may  subject to the satisfaction of service period requirements 
we have accrued the majority of the estimated expense associated with the vesting of these units  however  we expect to incur an additional million in the first quarter of and million in the second quarter of primarily related to amortization of service period requirements 
we expect to satisfy the may vesting of phantom units by paying cash for the settlement of approximately  phantom units in lieu of delivering common units and issuing approximately  common units after netting for taxes to satisfy the remainder of the vesting

ferc quarterly reporting 
on february  the ferc issued the final rules on quarterly reporting with  among other things  the addition of the ferc form no 
q quarterly financial reporting of oil pipeline companies 
our first filing will be due on july  the rules as finalized differ from the original proposal  and we are still analyzing the potential costs associated with compliance 
it does not appear at this point that such costs will have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations  but will add incrementally to our overall regulatory compliance costs 
sarbanes oxley act and new sec rules 
several regulatory and legislative initiatives were introduced in and in response to developments during and regarding accounting issues at large public companies  resulting disruptions in the capital markets and ensuing calls for action to prevent repetition of those events 
implementation of reforms in connection with these initiatives have added and will add to the costs of doing business for all publicly traded entities  including the partnership 
these costs will have an adverse impact on future income and cash flow 
longer term outlook 
the partnership s longer term outlook  spanning a period of five or more years  is influenced by many factors affecting the north american crude oil sector 
some of the more significant trends and factors include continued overall depletion of us crude oil production 
the continuing convergence of worldwide crude oil supply and demand lines 
aggressive practices in the us to maintain working crude oil inventory levels below historical levels 
industry compliance with the department of transportation s adoption of the american petroleum institute s standard for testing and maintenance of storage tanks  which will require significant investments to maintain existing crude oil inventory capacity or  alternatively  will result in a reduction of existing inventory capacity by the introduction of increased crude oil production from north american supplies primarily canadian oil sands and deepwater gulf of mexico sources that will  of economic necessity  compete for u 
s markets currently being supplied by non north american foreign crude imports 
we believe the collective impact of these trends  factors and developments  many of which are beyond our control  will result in an increasingly volatile crude oil market that is subject to more frequent short term swings in market prices and shifts in market structure 
in an environment of reduced inventories and tight supply and demand balances  even relatively minor supply disruptions can cause significant price swings 
conversely  despite a relatively balanced market on a global basis  competition within a given region of the us could cause downward pricing pressure and significantly impact regional crude oil price differentials among crude oil grades and locations 
although we believe our business strategy is designed to manage these trends  factors and potential developments and that we are strategically positioned to benefit from certain of these developments  there can be no assurance that we will not be negatively affected 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity cash generated from operations and our credit facilities are our primary sources of liquidity 
at december   we had a working capital deficit of approximately million and approximately million of availability under our committed revolving credit facilities and approximately million of availability under the hedged inventory facility 
we completed several transactions in the fourth quarter of that increased our borrowing capacity and enhanced our liquidity position as of december  in november  we refinanced our senior secured credit facilities with new senior unsecured credit facilities totaling million and a million uncommitted  senior secured facility for the purchase of hedged crude oil 
we also completed the sale of million of senior notes in december of  the proceeds of which were used to pay down outstanding balances on our revolving credit facilities 
see credit facilities and long term debt 
in addition  in anticipation of a potential pending acquisition  during december  we completed a public offering of  common units priced at per unit 
net proceeds from the offering  including our general partner s proportionate capital contribution and expenses associated with the offering  were approximately million and were used to pay down outstanding balances on our revolving credit facilities 
we believe that we have sufficient liquid assets  cash from operations and borrowing capacity under our credit agreements to meet our financial commitments  debt service obligations  contingencies and anticipated capital expenditures 
however  we are subject to business and operational risks that could adversely affect our cash flow 
a material decrease in our cash flows would likely produce an adverse effect on our borrowing capacity 
cash flows cash flows for the years ended december   and were as follows year ended december  in millions cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities operating activities 
cash generated by our operations calculated as net income plus i depreciation and amortization  ii the noncash portion of the ltip charge and iii the noncash loss on the refinancing of debt was approximately million for approximately million of this cash was used for linefill requirements  million was used for payments of terminated interest rate swaps and approximately million net was used for accounts receivable  accounts payable  inventory and other purposes  resulting in approximately million of net cash provided by operating activities for approximately million of the increase in as compared to is due to an increase in net income  predominantly related to our acquisitions completed in april and july and august the remainder of the increase is due to changes in working capital items related to the following i the collection of approximately million of amounts that had been outstanding primarily since and  ii the collection of prepayments due to the increase in credit risk associated with certain counter parties  and iii the sale of hedged crude oil inventory purchased in and and the related changes in accounts receivable and accounts payable 
in addition to the hedged inventory transactions having a positive effect on cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december   similar transactions had a negative effect on the year ended december  as the inventory was being purchased and stored  thus resulting in an even larger variance when comparing the two periods 
investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities in  and consisted predominantly of cash paid for acquisitions 
net cash used in was million and was comprised of i an aggregate million paid primarily for ten acquisitions completed during  ii a million deposit paid on the potential pending acquisition from shell pipeline company  see acquisitions  iii proceeds of approximately million from sales of assets  and iv million paid for additions to property and equipment  including million related to the construction of crude oil gathering and transmission lines in west texas 
net cash used in was million and was comprised of i an aggregate million paid for three acquisitions completed during  see acquisitions  and ii million paid for additions to property and equipment  primarily related to our cushing expansion and the construction of the marshall terminal in canada 
net cash used in was million and was comprised of i an aggregate million paid for three acquisitions completed during  see acquisitions  and ii million paid for additions to property and equipment 
financing activities 
cash provided by financing activities in consisted primarily of million of net proceeds from the issuance of common units and senior unsecured notes  used primarily to fund capital projects and acquisitions and pay down outstanding balances on our revolving credit facilities and senior term loans 
net repayments of our short term and long term revolving credit facilities and related senior term loans were million 
in addition  million of distributions were paid to our unitholders and general partner 
cash provided by financing activities in consisted of approximately million of net proceeds from the issuance of common units and senior unsecured notes  used primarily to fund capital projects and acquisitions and pay down outstanding balances on the revolving credit facility 
net repayments of our short term and long term revolving credit facilities during were million 
in addition  million of distributions were paid to our unitholders and general partner during the year ended december  cash provided by financing activities in consisted primarily of net short term and long term borrowings of million  proceeds from the issuance of common units of million  and the payment of million in distributions to our unitholders and general partner 
universal shelf we have filed with the securities and exchange commission a universal shelf registration statement that  subject to effectiveness at the time of use  allows us to issue from time to time up to an aggregate of million of debt or equity securities 
at december   we have approximately million of remaining availability under this registration statement 
credit facilities and long term debt during december  we completed the sale of million of senior notes due december the notes were issued by us and a owned finance subsidiary neither of which have independent assets or operations at a discount of million  resulting in an effective interest rate of 
interest payments are due on june and december of each year 
the notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed  jointly and severally  by all of our existing owned subsidiaries  except for subsidiaries that are minor 
during november  we refinanced our bank credit facilities with new senior unsecured credit facilities totaling million and a million uncommitted facility for the purpose of financing hedged crude oil 
the million of new facilities consist of a four year  million us revolving credit facility  a day  million canadian revolving credit facility with a five year term out option  a four year  million canadian working capital revolving credit facility  and a day  million revolving credit facility 
all of the facilities with the exception of the million hedged inventory facility are unsecured 
the million hedged inventory facility is an uncommitted working capital facility  which will be used to finance the purchase of hedged crude oil inventory for storage when market conditions warrant 
borrowings under the hedged inventory facility will be secured by the inventory purchased under the facility and the associated accounts receivable  and will be repaid with the proceeds from the sale of such inventory 
our credit facilities  the indenture governing the senior notes and the indenture governing the senior notes contain cross default provisions 
our credit facilities prohibit distributions on  or purchases or redemptions of  units if any default or event of default is continuing 
in addition  the agreements contain various covenants limiting our ability to  among other things incur indebtedness if certain financial ratios are not maintained  grant liens  engage in transactions with affiliates  enter into sale leaseback transactions  sell substantially all of our assets or enter into a merger or consolidation 
our credit facilities treat a change of control as an event of default and also require us to maintain an interest coverage ratio that is not less than to  and a debt coverage ratio which will not be greater than to on all outstanding debt and to on all outstanding debt during an acquisition period generally  the period consisting of three fiscal quarters following an acquisition greater than million 
for covenant compliance purposes  letters of credit and borrowings to fund hedged inventory and margin requirements are excluded when calculating the debt coverage ratio 
a default under our credit facilities would permit the lenders to accelerate the maturity of the outstanding debt 
as long as we are in compliance with our credit agreements  they do not restrict our ability to make distributions of available cash as defined in our partnership agreement 
we are currently in compliance with the covenants contained in our credit facilities and indentures 
the average life of our long term debt capitalization at december   was approximately years 
at the end of the year we had approximately million of short term working capital borrowings outstanding under our million us revolving credit facility  no amounts outstanding under our million  day revolving credit facility  no amounts outstanding under our million canadian working capital revolving credit facility  approximately million outstanding under our million canadian revolving credit facility that matures in  million of senior notes that mature in and million of senior notes that mature in contingencies industry credit markets and accounts receivable 
throughout the latter part of and all of  there were significant disruptions and extreme volatility in the financial markets and credit markets 
because of the credit intensive nature of the energy industry and extreme financial distress at several large  diversified energy companies  the energy industry was especially impacted by these developments 
we believe that these developments have created an increased level of direct and indirect counterparty credit and performance risk 
the majority of our credit extensions relate to our gathering and marketing activities that can generally be described as high volume and low margin activities 
in our credit approval process  we make a determination of the amount  if any  of the line of credit to be extended to any given customer and the form and amount of financial performance assurances we require 
such financial assurances are commonly provided to us in the form of standby letters of credit  advance cash payments or parental guarantees 
at december   we had received approximately million of advance cash payments and prepayments from third parties to mitigate credit risk 
export license matter 
in our gathering and marketing activities  we import and export crude oil from and to canada 
exports of crude oil are subject to the short supply controls of the export administration regulations ear and must be licensed by the bureau of industry and security the bis of the us department of commerce 
we have determined that we may have exceeded the quantity of crude oil exports authorized by previous licenses 
export of crude oil in excess of the authorized amounts is a violation of the ear 
on october   we submitted to the bis an initial notification of voluntary disclosure 
the bis subsequently informed us that we could continue to export while previous exports were under review 
we applied for and have received a new license allowing for exports of volumes more than adequately reflecting our anticipated needs 
on october   we submitted additional information to the bis 
at this time  we have received no indication whether the bis intends to charge us with a violation of the ear or  if so  what penalties would be assessed 
as a result  we cannot estimate the ultimate impact of this matter 
alfons sperber v 
plains resources inc  et 
al 
on december   a putative class action lawsuit was filed in the delaware chancery court  new castle county  entitled alfons sperber v 
plains resources inc  et al 
this suit  brought on behalf of a putative class of plains all american pipeline  lp common unit holders  asserts breach of fiduciary duty and breach of contract claims against the partnership  plains aap  lp  and plains all american gp llc and its directors  as well as breach of fiduciary duty claims against plains resources inc and its directors 
the complaint seeks to enjoin or rescind a proposed acquisition of all of the outstanding stock of plains resources inc  as well as declaratory relief  an accounting  disgorgement and the imposition of a constructive trust  and an award of damages  fees  expenses and costs  among other things 
the partnership intends to vigorously defend this lawsuit 
pipeline and storage regulation 
some of our petroleum pipelines and storage tanks in the united states are subject to regulation by the us department of transportation dot with respect to the design  installation  testing  construction  operation  replacement and management of pipeline and tank facilities 
in addition  we must permit access to and copying of records  and must make certain reports available and provide information as required by the secretary of transportation 
comparable regulation exists in canada and in some states in which we conduct intrastate common carrier or private pipeline operations 
see items and business and properties regulation pipeline and storage regulation 
regulatory compliance costs include those related to pipeline integrity management these are recurring expenses estimated to be approximately million in and the adoption by the dot of api as the standard for the inspection  repair  alteration and reconstruction of jurisdictional storage tanks these are recurring expenses estimated to be approximately million in 
we will continue to refine our estimates as information from initial assessments becomes available 
asset acquisitions are an integral part of our business strategy 
as we acquire additional assets we may be required to incur additional costs in order to ensure that the acquired assets comply with pipeline integrity regulations and api standards 
the timing of such additional costs is uncertain and could vary materially from our current projections 
the dot is currently considering expanding the scope of its pipeline regulation to include certain gathering pipeline systems that are not currently subject to regulation 
this expanded scope would likely include the establishment of additional pipeline integrity management programs for these newly regulated pipelines 
the dot is in the initial stages of evaluating this initiative and we do not currently know what  if any  impact this will have on our operating expenses 
however  we cannot assure you that future costs related to the potential programs will not be material 
other 
a pipeline  terminal or other facility may experience damage as a result of an accident or natural disaster 
these hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life  severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment  pollution or environmental damage and suspension of operations 
we maintain insurance of various types that we consider adequate to cover our operations and properties 
the insurance covers our assets in amounts considered reasonable 
the insurance policies are subject to deductibles that we consider reasonable and not excessive 
our insurance does not cover every potential risk associated with operating pipelines  terminals and other facilities  including the potential loss of significant revenues 
the trend appears to be a contraction in the breadth and depth of available coverage  while costs  deductibles and retention levels have increased 
absent a material favorable change in the insurance markets  this trend is expected to continue as we continue to grow and expand 
as a result  we anticipate that we will elect to self insure more of our activities 
see items and business and properties operational hazards and insurance 
the occurrence of a significant event not fully insured or indemnified against  or the failure of a party to meet its indemnification obligations  could materially and adversely affect our operations and financial condition 
we believe that we are adequately insured for public liability and property damage to others with respect to our operations 
with respect to all of our coverage  no assurance can be given that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable 
we may experience future releases of crude oil into the environment from our pipeline and storage operations  or discover past releases that were previously unidentified 
although we maintain an inspection program designed to prevent and  as applicable  to detect and address such releases promptly  damages and liabilities incurred due to any such environmental releases from our assets may substantially affect our business 
capital requirements we have made and will continue to make capital expenditures for acquisitions and expansion and maintenance capital 
historically  we have financed these expenditures primarily with cash generated by operations  credit facility borrowings  the issuance of senior unsecured notes and the sale of additional common units 
we expect to spend approximately million on expansion capital projects during these projects include million on upgrades related to prior acquisitions  million on the cushing phase iv expansion  million on the iatan system expansion  million on information systems related projects and million on other operations projects 
in addition to these expansion projects  we expect to spend approximately million for the pending acquisition of interests in the capline and capwood pipeline systems million including the million deposit made in december 
in april  we will make the contingent payment related to the canpet acquisition  as discussed in note partners capital and distributions in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we also estimate we will spend approximately million in maintenance capital during commitments contractual obligations 
in the ordinary course of doing business we enter into various contractual obligations for varying terms and amounts 
the following table includes our non cancellable contractual obligations as of december   and our best estimate of the period in which the obligation will be settled in millions thereafter total long term debt operating leases capital expenditure obligations other long term liabilities total operating leases are primarily for office rent and trucks used in our gathering activities 
includes approximately million for the capline acquisition 
approximately million of the balance is related to the portion of our ltip accrual that we anticipate settling with units in excludes approximately million non current liability related to sfas in addition to the items in the table above  we have entered into various operational commitments and agreements related to pipeline operations and to the marketing  transportation  terminalling and storage of crude oil and the marketing and storage of lpg 
the majority of these contractual commitments are for the purchase of crude oil and lpg that are made under contracts that range in term from a thirty day evergreen to three years 
a substantial portion of the contracts that extend beyond thirty days include cancellation provisions that allow us to cancel the contract with thirty days written notice 
from time to time  we also enter into various types of sale and exchange transactions including fixed price delivery contracts  floating price collar arrangements  financial swaps and crude oil futures contracts as hedging devices 
through these transactions  we seek to maintain a position that is substantially balanced between crude oil and lpg purchases and sales and future delivery obligations 
the volume and prices of these purchase and sale contracts are subject to market volatility and fluctuate with changes in the nymex price of crude oil from period to period 
during  these purchases averaged approximately billion per month 
letters of credit 
in connection with our crude oil marketing  we provide certain suppliers and transporters with irrevocable standby letters of credit to secure our obligation for the purchase of crude oil 
our liabilities with respect to these purchase obligations are recorded in accounts payable on our balance sheet in the month the crude oil is purchased 
generally  these letters of credit are issued for up to seventy day periods and are terminated upon completion of each transaction 
at december   we had outstanding letters of credit of approximately million 
distributions 
we will distribute of our available cash within days after the end of each quarter to unitholders of record and to our general partner 
available cash is generally defined as all cash and cash equivalents on hand at the end of the quarter less reserves established by our general partner for future requirements 
on february   we paid a cash distribution of per unit on all outstanding units 
the total distribution paid was approximately million  with approximately million paid to our common unitholders  million paid to our subordinated unitholders and million paid to our general partner for its general partner million and incentive distribution interests million 
our general partner is entitled to incentive distributions if the amount we distribute with respect to any quarter exceeds levels specified in our partnership agreement 
under the quarterly incentive distribution provisions  our general partner is entitled  without duplication  to of amounts we distribute in excess of per limited partner unit  of amounts we distribute in excess of per limited partner unit and of amounts we distribute in excess of per limited partner unit 
we paid million to the general partner in incentive distributions in see item certain relationships and related transactions our general partner 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements as defined by item of regulation s k 
risk factors related to our business the level of our profitability is dependent upon an adequate supply of crude oil from fields located offshore and onshore california 
production from these offshore fields has experienced substantial production declines since a significant portion of our segment margin is derived from pipeline transportation margins associated with the santa ynez and point arguello fields located offshore california 
we expect that there will continue to be natural production declines from each of these fields as the underlying reservoirs are depleted 
a  barrel per day decline in volumes shipped from these fields would result in a decrease in annual pipeline tariff revenues of approximately million 
in addition  any production disruption from these fields due to production problems  transportation problems or other reasons would have a material adverse effect on our business 
potential future acquisitions and expansions  if any  may affect our business by substantially increasing the level of our indebtedness and contingent liabilities and increasing our risks of being unable to effectively integrate these new operations 
from time to time  we evaluate and acquire assets and businesses that we believe complement our existing assets and businesses 
acquisitions may require substantial capital or the incurrence of substantial indebtedness 
if we consummate any future acquisitions  our capitalization and results of operations may change significantly  and you will not have the opportunity to evaluate the economic  financial and other relevant information that we will consider in determining the application of these funds and other resources 
the profitability of our pipeline operations depends on the volume of crude oil shipped by third parties 
third party shippers generally do not have long term contractual commitments to ship crude oil on our pipelines 
a decision by a shipper to substantially reduce or cease to ship volumes of crude oil on our pipelines could cause a significant decline in our revenues 
for example  an average  barrel per day variance in the basin pipeline system  equivalent to an approximate volume variance on that pipeline system  would result in an approximate million change in annualized segment margin 
the success of our business strategy to increase and optimize throughput on our pipeline and gathering assets is dependent upon our securing additional supplies of crude oil 
our operating results are dependent upon securing additional supplies of crude oil from increased production by oil companies and aggressive lease gathering efforts 
the ability of producers to increase production is dependent on the prevailing market price of oil  the exploration and production budgets of the major and independent oil companies  the depletion rate of existing reservoirs  the success of new wells drilled  environmental concerns  regulatory initiatives and other matters beyond our control 
there can be no assurance that production of crude oil will rise to sufficient levels to cause an increase in the throughput on our pipeline and gathering assets 
our operations are dependent upon demand for crude oil by refiners in the midwest and on the gulf coast 
any decrease in this demand could adversely affect our business 
demand also depends on the ability and willingness of shippers having access to our transportation assets to satisfy their demand by deliveries through those assets  and any decrease in this demand could adversely affect our business 
demand for crude oil is dependent upon the impact of future economic conditions  fuel conservation measures  alternative fuel requirements  governmental regulation or technological advances in fuel economy and energy generation devices  all of which could reduce demand 
we face intense competition in our terminalling and storage activities and gathering and marketing activities 
our competitors include other crude oil pipelines  the major integrated oil companies  their marketing affiliates  and independent gatherers  brokers and marketers of widely varying sizes  financial resources and experience 
some of these competitors have capital resources many times greater than ours and control greater supplies of crude oil 
a per barrel variance in the aggregate average segment margin would have an approximate million annual effect on segment margin 
newly acquired properties could expose us to environmental liabilities and increased regulatory compliance costs 
our business plan calls for a continuing acquisition program 
assets that we have acquired or may acquire in the future will likely have associated environmental liabilities  as well as required compliance with regulations such as the integrity maintenance program for regulated pipelines and the api standard for regulated storage 
although we attempt to identify such exposures and address the associated costs through indemnities  purchase price adjustments or insurance  we may experience costs not covered by indemnity  insurance or reserves 
the profitability of our gathering and marketing activities depends primarily on the volumes of crude oil we purchase and gather 
to maintain the volumes of crude oil we purchase  we must continue to contract for new supplies of crude oil to offset volumes lost because of natural declines in crude oil production from depleting wells or volumes lost to competitors 
replacement of lost volumes of crude oil is particularly difficult in an environment where production is low and competition to gather available production is intense 
generally  because producers experience inconveniences in switching crude oil purchasers  such as delays in receipt of proceeds while awaiting the preparation of new division orders  producers typically do not change purchasers on the basis of minor variations in price 
thus  we may experience difficulty acquiring crude oil at the wellhead in areas where there are existing relationships between producers and other gatherers and purchasers of crude oil 
we estimate that a  barrel per day decrease in barrels gathered by us would have an approximate million per year negative impact on segment margin 
this impact is based on a reasonable margin throughout various market conditions 
actual margins vary based on the location of the crude oil  the strength or weakness of the market and the grade or quality of crude oil 
we are exposed to the credit risk of our customers in the ordinary course of our gathering and marketing activities 
there can be no assurance that we have adequately assessed the credit worthiness of our existing or future counter parties or that there will not be an unanticipated deterioration in their credit worthiness  which could have an adverse impact on us 
in those cases where we provide division order services for crude oil purchased at the wellhead  we may be responsible for distribution of proceeds to all parties 
in other cases  we pay all of or a portion of the production proceeds to an operator who distributes these proceeds to the various interest owners 
these arrangements expose us to operator credit risk  and there can be no assurance that we will not experience losses in dealings with other parties 
in  we suffered a large loss from unauthorized crude oil trading by a former employee 
a loss of this kind could occur again in the future in spite of our best efforts to prevent it 
generally  it is our policy that as we purchase crude oil  we establish a margin by selling crude oil for physical delivery to third party users  such as independent refiners or major oil companies  or by entering into a future delivery obligation under futures contracts on the nymex and over the counter 
through these transactions  we seek to maintain a position that is substantially balanced between purchases  on the one hand  and sales or future delivery obligations  on the other hand 
our policy is not to acquire and hold crude oil  futures contracts or derivative products for the purpose of speculating on price changes 
we discovered in november that this policy was violated by one of our former employees  which resulted in aggregate losses of approximately million 
we have taken steps within our organization to enhance our processes and procedures to detect future unauthorized trading 
we cannot assure you  however  that these steps will detect and prevent all violations of our trading policies and procedures  particularly if deception or other intentional misconduct is involved 
our operations are subject to federal and state environmental and safety laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and operational safety 
our pipeline  gathering  storage and terminalling operations are subject to the risk of incurring substantial environmental and safety related costs and liabilities 
these costs and liabilities could arise under increasingly strict environmental and safety laws  including regulations and enforcement policies  or claims for damages to property or persons resulting from our operations 
if we were not able to recover such resulting costs through insurance or increased tariffs and revenues  our cash flows and results of operations could be materially impacted 
the transportation and storage of crude oil results in a risk that crude oil and other hydrocarbons may be suddenly or gradually released into the environment  potentially causing substantial expenditures for a response action  significant government penalties  liability to government agencies for natural resources damages  liability to private parties for personal injury or property damages  and significant business interruption 
our canadian pipeline assets are subject to federal and provincial regulation 
our canadian pipeline assets are subject to regulation by the national energy board and by provincial agencies 
with respect to a pipeline over which it has jurisdiction  each of these agencies has the power to determine the rates we are allowed to charge for transportation on such pipeline 
the extent to which regulatory agencies can override existing transportation contracts has not been fully decided 
our pipeline systems are dependent upon their interconnections with other crude oil pipelines to reach end markets 
reduced throughput on these interconnecting pipelines as a result of testing  line repair  reduced operating pressures or other causes could result in reduced throughput on our pipeline systems that would adversely affect our profitability 
fluctuations in demand can negatively affect our operating results 
fluctuations in demand for crude oil  such as caused by refinery downtime or shutdown  can have a negative effect on our operating results 
specifically  reduced demand in an area serviced by our transmission systems will negatively affect the throughput on such systems 
although the negative impact may be mitigated or overcome by our ability to capture differentials created by demand fluctuations  this ability is dependent on location and grade of crude oil  and thus is unpredictable 
cash distributions are not guaranteed and may fluctuate with our performance and the establishment of financial reserves 
because distributions on the common units are dependent on the amount of cash we generate  distributions may fluctuate based on our performance 
the actual amount of cash that is available to be distributed each quarter will depend on numerous factors  some of which are beyond our control and the control of the general partner 
cash distributions are dependent primarily on cash flow  including cash flow from financial reserves and working capital borrowings  and not solely on profitability  which is affected by non cash items 
therefore  cash distributions might be made during periods when we record losses and might not be made during periods when we records profits 
the terms of our indebtedness may limit our ability to borrow additional funds  make distributions to unitholders  comply with the terms of our indebtedness or capitalize on business opportunities 
as of december   our total outstanding long term debt was approximately million 
our payment of principal and interest on the debt will reduce the cash available for distribution on the units 
various limitations in our indebtedness may reduce our ability to incur additional debt  to engage in some transactions and to capitalize on business opportunities 
any subsequent refinancing of our current indebtedness or any new indebtedness could have similar or greater restrictions 
changes in currency exchange rates and foreign currency restrictions and shortages could adversely affect our operating results 
because we conduct operations outside the us  we are exposed to currency fluctuations and exchange rate risks that may adversely affect our results of operations 
in addition  legal restrictions or shortages in currencies outside the us may prevent us from converting sufficient local currency to enable us to comply with our currency placement obligations not denominated in local currency or to meet our operating needs and debt service requirements 
our tax treatment depends on our status as a partnership for federal income tax purposes  as well as our not being subject to entity level taxation by states 
if the irs treats us as a corporation or we become subject to entity level taxation for state tax purposes  it would substantially reduce distributions to our unitholders and our ability to make payments on our debt securities 
the after tax economic benefit of an investment in the common units depends largely on our being treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes 
if we were classified as a corporation for federal income tax purposes  we would pay federal income tax on our income at the corporate rate 
some or all of the distributions made to unitholders would be treated as dividend income  and no income  gains  losses or deductions would flow through to unitholders 
treatment of us as a corporation would cause a material reduction in the anticipated cash flow and after tax return to the unitholders  likely causing a substantial reduction in the value of the common units 
moreover  treatment of us as a corporation would materially and adversely affect our ability to make payments on our debt securities 
in addition  because of widespread state budget deficits  several states are evaluating ways to subject partnerships to entity level taxation through the imposition of state income  franchise or other forms of taxation 
if any state were to impose a tax upon us as an entity  the cash available for distribution to you would be reduced 
the partnership agreement provides that  if a law is enacted or existing law is modified or interpreted in a manner that subjects us to taxation as a corporation or otherwise subjects us to entity level taxation for federal  state or local income tax purposes  then the minimum quarterly distribution and the target distribution levels will be decreased to reflect that impact on us 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s we are exposed to various market risks  including volatility in i crude oil and lpg commodity prices  ii interest rates and iii currency exchange rates 
we utilize various derivative instruments to manage such exposure 
our risk management policies and procedures are designed to monitor interest rates  currency exchange rates  nymex and over the counter positions  and physical volumes  grades  locations and delivery schedules to ensure our hedging activities address our market risks 
we have a risk management function that has direct responsibility and authority for our risk policies and our trading controls and procedures and certain aspects of corporate risk management 
to hedge the risks discussed above we engage in price risk management activities that we categorize by the risks we are hedging 
the following discussion addresses each category of risk 
commodity price risk we hedge our exposure to price fluctuations with respect to crude oil and lpg in storage  and expected purchases  sales and transportation of these commodities 
the derivative instruments utilized consist primarily of futures and option contracts traded on the nymex and over the counter transactions  including crude oil swap and option contracts entered into with financial institutions and other energy companies see note to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the mitigation of credit risk 
our policy is to purchase only crude oil for which we have a market  and to structure our sales contracts so that crude oil price fluctuations do not materially affect the segment margin we receive 
except for the controlled trading program discussed below  we do not acquire and hold crude oil futures contracts or other derivative products for the purpose of speculating on crude oil price changes that might expose us to indeterminable losses 
while we seek to maintain a position that is substantially balanced within our crude oil lease purchase and lpg activities  we may experience net unbalanced positions for short periods of time as a result of production  transportation and delivery variances as well as logistical issues associated with inclement weather conditions 
in connection with managing these positions and maintaining a constant presence in the marketplace  both necessary for our core business  we engage in a controlled trading program for up to an aggregate of  barrels of crude oil and an aggregate of  barrels of lpg 
in order to hedge margins involving our physical assets and manage risks associated with our crude oil purchase and sale obligations  we use derivative instruments  including regulated futures and options transactions  as well as over the counter instruments 
in analyzing our risk management activities  we draw a distinction between enterprise level risks and trading related risks 
enterprise level risks are those that underlie our core businesses and may be managed based on whether there is value in doing so 
conversely  trading related risks the risks involved in trading in the hopes of generating an increased return are not inherent in the core business  rather  those risks arise as a result of engaging in the trading activity 
we have a risk management committee that approves all new risk management strategies through a formal process 
with the partial exception of the controlled trading program  our approved strategies are intended to mitigate enterprise level risks that are inherent in our core businesses of gathering and marketing and storage 
although the intent of our risk management strategies is to hedge our margin  not all of our derivatives qualify for hedge accounting 
in such instances  changes in the fair values of these derivatives will receive mark to market treatment in current earnings  and result in greater potential for earnings volatility than in the past 
this accounting treatment is discussed further under note summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
all of our open commodity price risk derivatives at december  were categorized as non trading 
the fair value of these instruments and the change in fair value that would be expected from a percent price decrease are shown in the table below in millions fair value effect of price decrease crude oil futures contracts swaps and options contracts lpg futures contracts swaps and options contracts the fair values of the futures contracts are based on quoted market prices obtained from the nymex 
the fair value of the swaps and option contracts are estimated based on quoted prices from various sources such as independent reporting services  industry publications and brokers 
these quotes are compared to the contract price of the swap  which approximates the gain or loss that would have been realized if the contracts had been closed out at year end 
for positions where independent quotations are not available  an estimate is provided  or the prevailing market price at which the positions could be liquidated is used 
the assumptions in these estimates as well as the source is maintained by the independent risk control function 
all hedge positions offset physical exposures to the cash market  none of these offsetting physical exposures are included in the above table 
price risk sensitivities were calculated by assuming an across the board percent decrease in price regardless of term or historical relationships between the contractual price of the instruments and the underlying commodity price 
in the event of an actual percent change in prompt month crude prices  the fair value of our derivative portfolio would typically change less than that shown in the table due to lower volatility in out month prices 
interest rate risk we utilize both fixed and variable rate debt  and are exposed to market risk due to the floating interest rates on our credit facilities 
therefore  we utilize interest rate swaps and collars to hedge interest obligations on specific debt issuances  including anticipated debt issuances 
the table below presents principal payments and the related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates for variable rate debt outstanding at december  the senior notes issued during and the senior notes issued during are fixed rate notes and their interest rates are not subject to market risk 
our variable rate debt bears interest at libor  prime or the bankers acceptance plus the applicable margin 
the average interest rates presented below are based upon rates in effect at december  the carrying values of the variable rate instruments in our credit facilities approximate fair value primarily because interest rates fluctuate with prevailing market rates 
expected year of maturity thereafter total in millions liabilities short term debt variable rate average interest rate long term debt variable rate average interest rate interest rate swaps are used to hedge underlying interest payment obligations 
we estimate the fair value of these instruments based on current termination values 
these instruments hedge interest rates on specific debt issuances and qualify for hedge accounting 
the interest rate differential is reflected as an adjustment to interest expense over the life of the instruments 
the table shown below summarizes the fair value of our interest rate swaps by the year of maturity in millions year of maturity total interest rate swaps at december   an interest rate swap with an aggregate notional principal amount of million was outstanding 
the interest rate swap is based on libor rates and provides for a libor rate of for a million notional principal amount expiring march interest on the underlying debt being hedged is based on libor plus a margin 
currency exchange risk our cash flow stream relating to our canadian operations is based on the us dollar equivalent of such amounts measured in canadian dollars 
assets and liabilities of our canadian subsidiaries are translated to us dollars using the applicable exchange rate as of the end of a reporting period 
revenues  expenses and cash flow are translated using the average exchange rate during the reporting period 
because a significant portion of our canadian business is conducted in canadian dollars  we use certain financial instruments to minimize the risks of changes in the exchange rate 
these instruments include forward exchange contracts  forward extra option contracts and cross currency swaps 
additionally  at times  a portion of our debt is denominated in canadian dollars 
at december   we did not have any canadian dollar debt 
all of the financial instruments utilized are placed with large creditworthy financial institutions 
at december   we had forward exchange contracts that allow us to exchange million canadian for at least million us quarterly during based on a canadian dollar to us dollar exchange rate of to and million canadian for at least million us quarterly during based on a canadian dollar to us dollar exchange rate of to 
at december   we also had cross currency swap contracts for an aggregate notional principal amount of million effectively converting this amount of our us dollar denominated debt to million of canadian dollar debt based on a canadian dollar to us dollar exchange rate of to 
the notional principal amount reduces by million us in may and may and has a final maturity in may million us we estimate the fair value of these instruments based on current termination values 
the table shown below summarizes the fair value of our foreign currency hedges by year of maturity in millions year of maturity total forward exchange contracts cross currency swaps total
