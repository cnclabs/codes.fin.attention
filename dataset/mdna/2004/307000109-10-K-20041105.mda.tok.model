during fiscal the company completed the strategic assessment  concept testing and development of implementation plans for additional investments in its urban initiative and a cooler program for perishable food 
the urban initiative in fiscal includes investments in process changes  technology and people to improve the operating performance  including sales  of more than  stores in thirty large metropolitan markets 
approximately stores are expected to be impacted in the first quarter 
under the cooler program  beginning in january coolers are expected to be installed in selected stores 
by the end of the fiscal year on august   the company plans to have coolers installed in approximately stores 
the company also plans to begin implementation by fiscal year end of new point of sale software to facilitate the acceptance of food stamps in stores with coolers  simplify cashier training and speed up checkout processes 
these programs  together with the introduction of additional opportunistically purchased goods available throughout the year  with particular emphasis on the holiday season  and the addition of one advertising circular in november  should contribute to an increase in sales in existing stores in fiscal the company currently expects that sales in existing stores will accelerate from the increase in the fourth quarter of fiscal to increases in the to range by the end of fiscal during fiscal  the company opened stores and closed stores for a net addition of stores  compared with the opening of stores and closing of stores for a net addition of stores during fiscal of these new store openings of the properties are owned by the company  and the balance of the properties are leased 
the company s focus on urban markets has contributed to the strong sales performance of new stores  but the lead times continue to be less predictable and longer for opening urban stores verses non urban stores  including longer time for the permitting process and the completion of leasehold improvements and new construction 
the sales performance of new stores stores open months or less was equal to approximately of the chain average sales per store in both fiscal and fiscal the company also expanded or relocated stores in fiscal  compared with stores that were expanded or relocated in fiscal in addition  approximately stores in fiscal and stores in fiscal were renovated 
the company currently plans to open approximately to stores and close approximately to stores in fiscal resulting in approximately to net new store growth and to net square footage growth 
to achieve this target  the company has retained real estate brokers in certain major metropolitan areas and also has added personnel to its real estate department 
urban markets will continue to be the focus with approximately to of the new stores expected to open in urban areas 
the company also currently expects to renovate an additional stores and expand or relocate approximately stores in fiscal store opening  closing  expansion  relocation and renovation plans are continuously reviewed and are subject to change 
cost of sales and margin cost of sales increased approximately million in fiscal compared with fiscal  and approximately million in fiscal compared with fiscal these increases primarily reflected the additional sales volume in each of the years 
cost of sales  as a percentage of net sales  was in both fiscal and fiscal and in fiscal the percentage was favorably impacted in fiscal by approximately of sales due to a change in the treatment of certain vendor allowances in conformity with a recent accounting pronouncement 
this change will not impact the comparability of future years 
lower merchandise markdowns also favorably impacted the percentage in fiscal a slight increase in markdowns in the first quarter of fiscal was more than offset by lower markdowns in the remaining quarters 
the decrease in the cost of sales percentage in fiscal due to this accounting change and lower markdowns was offset by a shift in the merchandise mix to more lower margin basic consumables and relatively less sales of higher margin discretionary merchandise 
the cost of sales percentage in fiscal was also negatively impacted by increased shrinkage and increased freight costs due to higher fuel expense 
the company is addressing the issue of shrinkage by implementing new loss prevention reports that provide more visibility to store level issues and by adding personnel to its loss prevention department 
in addition  as part of its urban initiative  the company is modifying its field management structure to increase management presence and the frequency of inspections in its urban markets 
the opening of the eighth distribution center in january will reduce the average distance between the stores and a distribution center and that reduction is expected to offset  to some degree  the higher fuel costs 
the decrease in the cost of sales percentage for fiscal was due primarily to improved initial margins  the favorable impact of supply chain initiatives  including the opening of the seventh full service distribution center  and the implementation of a transportation management system 
for fiscal  the company s plan is for the cost of sales percentage to increase as compared to the percentage in fiscal due to the continuing effect of the shift in the merchandise mix to more lower margin basic consumables  rising fuel costs and increased shrinkage 
these impacts should be most pronounced during the first half of the fiscal year and the shrink initiatives and new distribution center are expected to mitigate these impacts during the second half of the fiscal year 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased approximately million in fiscal compared with fiscal  and approximately million in fiscal compared with fiscal the increases in these expenses primarily were attributable to additional costs arising from the continued growth in the number of stores in operation and the continued ramp up of the seventh distribution center 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses were in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales for fiscal was due primarily to below plan sales which negatively impacted the company s ability to leverage its cost structure 
in addition  the effect of the change in treatment of certain vendor allowances mentioned previously approximately of sales negatively impacted expense leverage 
this change will not impact the comparability of future years 
continued increases in insurance costs  primarily workers compensation approximately of sales  and increased rent approximately of sales also adversely impacted expense leverage 
the workers compensation cost increase is due in large part to the continued growth in the number of associates and to an increase in the average claim amount primarily due to medical cost increases 
while the company is aggressively working to reduce the frequency and severity of claims through corporate preventative initiatives  those costs are expected to continue to increase faster than sales in the near term 
the rent increase related in part to the company s opening of more build to suit and other new store construction 
the increase in the selling  general and administrative expense percentage of sales for fiscal was offset slightly by a reduction in bonus costs approximately of sales as the company did not reach the earnings target necessary for payment of full bonuses 
the increase in the selling  general and administrative expense percentage of sales for fiscal was due primarily to increased insurance costs primarily workers compensation and legal related costs 
in addition  the loss of planned sales due to opening of a lesser number of new stores than originally planned also adversely impacted expense leverage 
this was offset slightly by the elimination of an advertising circular distributed in fiscal for fiscal  the company s plan is for the selling  general and administrative expense percentage to sales to increase as compared to the percentage in fiscal the company expects the funding of its various growth initiatives as previously mentioned to negatively impact its expense leverage for the year by approximately of sales 
in addition  increases in insurance and rent may also negatively impact expense leverage depending  in part  on the sales benefit of new programs 
income taxes the effective tax rate was in fiscal  and in both fiscal and fiscal for fiscal  the company s plan is for the effective tax rate to increase slightly compared to the rate in fiscal due to the effect of changes in state income taxes 
based on the above plans for sales  cost of sales  selling  general and administrative expenses and tax rate  the company s current plan is for net income per diluted share of common stock in fiscal to increase in the to range 
liquidity and capital resources the company has consistently maintained a strong liquidity position 
cash provided by operating activities during fiscal was million as compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal these amounts have enabled the company to fund its regular operating needs  capital expenditure program  cash dividend payments and any repurchase of the company s common stock 
in addition  the company maintains million of unsecured revolving credit facilities with banks for short term financing of seasonal cash needs 
one hundred million dollars of the facilities expires on may  and the remaining million expires on may  the company had no borrowings against these facilities during fiscal there were no long term borrowings during fiscal  or merchandise inventories at august  increased over the level at august  this increase was due to additional inventory for net new stores and the accelerated flow of seasonal merchandise as part of the program to improve store level presentations and sales during the holiday period by smoothing the workflow in the stores and distribution network 
as a result of conservative planning and the curtailment of some planned purchases  out of season apparel inventories were approximately lower on a per store basis than at the end of fiscal with a more aggressive holiday seasonal sales plan this year  the company expects inventories per store to continue at higher year over year levels through the end of the first quarter of fiscal  but the plan is for inventories to return to more normal levels by the end of the second quarter of fiscal the slight decrease in capital expenditures to million in fiscal from million in fiscal primarily was due to the fact that substantially more expenditures were incurred in fiscal to complete construction of the seventh distribution center than were incurred in fiscal to begin construction of the eighth distribution center 
capital expenditures for fiscal are expected to be approximately million  which primarily represent estimated expenditures for new store expansion  including construction of an increased number of stores  existing store expansion  relocation  and renovation  the completion of construction of the eighth distribution center and start of construction of the ninth distribution center  expenditures related to store focused technology infrastructure and the implementation of a cooler program for perishable goods in selected stores 
the new store expansion and eighth distribution center will also require additional investment in merchandise inventories 
capital spending plans  including store expansion  are continuously reviewed and are subject to change 
cash flow from current operations is expected to be sufficient to meet planned liquidity and capital resource needs  including store expansion and other capital spending programs and any repurchase of the company s common stock 
in addition  the company has available revolving credit facilities as discussed above 
on october   the company announced that the board of directors authorized the purchase of up to million shares of its outstanding common stock from time to time as market conditions warrant 
during the year ended august   the company purchased in the open market  million shares at a cost of million 
on april   the company announced that the board of directors authorized the purchase of up to an additional million shares of its outstanding common stock from time to time as market conditions warrant 
during the year ended august   the company purchased million shares at a cost of million  leaving million shares authorized to be purchased 
the following table shows the company s obligations and commitments as of august   to make future payments under contractual obligations in thousands payments due during one year fiscal period ending contractual obligations total august august august august august thereafter merchandise letters of credit operating leases construction obligations total contractual cash obligations most of the company s operating leases provide the company with an option to extend the term of the lease at designated rates 
the following table shows the company s other commercial commitments as of august  in thousands other commercial commitments total amounts committed standby letters of credit surety bonds total commercial commitments at august   approximately million of the merchandise letters of credit are included in accounts payable on the company s balance sheet 
a substantial portion of the outstanding amount of standby letters of credit and surety bonds which are primarily renewed on an annual basis are used as surety for future premium and deductible payments to the company s workers compensation and general liability insurance carrier 
the company accrues for these liabilities as described in the critical accounting policies section of this discussion 
recent accounting pronouncements no new accounting pronouncements issued or effective during the fiscal year have had or are expected to have a material impact on the financial statements 
critical accounting policies management believes the following accounting principles are critical because they involve significant judgments  assumptions  and estimates used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
merchandise inventories inventories are valued using the retail method  based on retail prices less markon percentages  which approximates the lower of first in  first out fifo cost or market 
the company records adjustment to inventory through cost of goods sold when retail price reductions  or markdowns  are taken against on hand inventory 
in addition  management makes estimates and judgments regarding  among other things  initial markups  markdowns  future demand for specific product categories and market conditions  all of which can significantly impact inventory valuation 
if actual demand or market conditions are different than those projected by management  additional markdowns may be necessary 
this risk is generally higher for seasonal merchandise than for non seasonal goods 
the company also provides for estimated inventory losses for damaged  lost or stolen inventory for the period from the physical inventory to the financial statement date 
these estimates are based on historical experience and other factors 
property and equipment property and equipment is stated at cost 
depreciation for financial reporting purposes is being provided principally by the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets 
the valuation and classification of these assets and the assignment of useful depreciable lives involves significant judgments and the use of estimates 
the company generally assigns no salvage value to property and equipment 
property and equipment is reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
historically  impairment losses on fixed assets have not been material to the company s financial position and results of operations 
insurance liabilities the company is primarily self insured for health care  property loss  workers compensation and general liability costs 
these costs are significant primarily due to the large number of the company s retail locations and employees 
the company s self insurance liabilities are based on the total estimated costs of claims filed and estimates of claims incurred but not reported  less amounts paid against such claims  and are not discounted 
management reviews current and historical claims data in developing its estimates 
the company also uses information provided by outside actuaries with respect to workers compensation and general liability claims 
if the underlying facts and circumstances of the claims change or the historical trend is not indicative of future trends  then the company may be required to record additional expense or a reduction to expense which could be material to the reported financial condition and results of operations
