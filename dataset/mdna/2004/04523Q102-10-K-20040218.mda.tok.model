item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading provider of enterprise communication solutions that manage and optimize the contact center by integrating the applications that drive customer communications  customer and contact center information and workforce productivity 
our software and hardware solutions allow businesses to better service their customers by connecting them to appropriate resources  functionalities or applications  regardless of user location or method of communication 
we understand the importance of unifying the applications that support customer communications  collect customer information and enhance workforce productivity  and we have focused exclusively on contact center solutions since our inception in we have a well established customer base  including more than two thirds of the fortune the current economic environment the economic climate in which we operate has been difficult over the last three years  and capital spending has decreased dramatically 
this has had a pronounced effect on our ability to generate new license fees  as it budgets have been frozen and large capital expenditures like those required to purchase some of our products have been quite limited 
additionally  competition for these more limited sales opportunities has increased  and we have seen intense price competition both for new licenses and for support services 
while we believe our installed base continues to represent a solid recurring revenue opportunity and a significant cash flow generator  we cannot provide any assurance that these pressures on it spending will ease  or that the general economic climate will improve 
continued competitive pressure and a weak economy could have a 
table of contents continuing pronounced effect on our operating results 
we have undertaken a variety of cost reduction measures designed to bring our operating expenses in line with our perceptions of the business climate 
some of the measures taken include outsourcing of manufacturing  renegotiation of contracts  and global workforce reductions 
significant financial events in during  we generated million in cash flow from operations  completed a private placement of preferred stock which generated net proceeds of million and repaid million of convertible subordinated debenture liabilities 
in addition  we substantially lowered our days sales outstanding represented in our accounts receivable 
sources of revenues our revenues are derived from license fees for software products and  to a lesser extent  sales of hardware products 
we also generate a substantial portion of our revenues from fees for services complementing such products  including software license updates and product support maintenance  installation  professional consulting and education 
we typically license our products on a per user basis with the price per user varying based on the selection of products licensed 
our software license update support fees are generally based on the level of support selected and the number of users licensed to use our products 
our professional service fees are generally based on a fixed price or time and materials basis 
our education services are generally billed on a per person basis 
we currently expect that services and support revenues will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future 
to date  revenues from license fees have been derived from direct sales of software products to end users through our direct sales force and from our channel and other alliance partners 
our ability to achieve revenue growth and improved operating margins  as well as increased worldwide sales  in the future will depend in large part upon our success in expanding and maintaining these indirect sales channels worldwide 
critical accounting policies and estimates note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this report includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of company s consolidated financial statements 
our critical accounting policies include revenue recognition  revenue reserves  allowance for doubtful accounts  accounting for income taxes  excess and obsolete inventory  and impairment of long lived assets and restructuring reserves 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting standards generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
the most significant estimates and assumptions relate to the allowance for doubtful accounts  revenue reserves  excess and obsolete inventory  impairment of long lived assets  valuation allowance and realization of deferred income taxes  and restructuring reserves 
actual amounts could differ significantly from these estimates 
the following is a brief discussion of the critical accounting policies and methods that we use 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from the sale of software licenses and hardware when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
delivery generally occurs when the product is delivered to a common carrier 
in any sales transaction through a distributor or reseller  we recognize revenues when the distributor or reseller sells to the end user 

table of contents for multiple element arrangements  we defer the fair value of revenue associated with each undelivered element until such time as delivery occurs 
deferred revenue is allocated to each element using vendor specific objective evidence of fair value 
fair value is established through separate sales of each element to third parties 
revenue reserves an estimate of the revenue reserve from customer returns is recorded as a reduction in revenues 
in determining our revenue reserve estimate  and in accordance with internal policy  we rely on historical data  known returned goods in transit and direct feedback from our internal business units 
our revenue reserve can vary from what actually occurs in that more or less product may be returned from what was originally estimated 
these factors and unanticipated changes in the economic and industry environment could make our return estimates differ from actual 
the revenue reserve was million as of december  allowance for doubtful accounts our management must make estimates of the collectibility of accounts receivable 
management specifically analyzes historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
the key factors we use in assessing this allowance are the individual judgments on specific customer balances and the overall aging of the total receivables 
assumptions and judgments regarding collectibility of accounts could differ from actual events 
the accounts receivable balance was million  net of allowance for doubtful accounts of million as of december  accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves management s estimation of our actual current tax exposure together with an assessment of temporary differences resulting from different treatments in tax and accounting of certain items 
these differences result in net deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or adjust this allowance in a period  we must include a tax expense or benefit within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determination of the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
we have a valuation allowance of million as of december   due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize all of our deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain net operating losses carried forward and research tax credits  before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which the deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to adjust our valuation allowance  which could favorably impact our results of operations 
excess and obsolete inventory we value inventory at the lower of the actual cost or the current estimated net realizable value of the inventory 
management regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand and records a write down for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on production and supply requirements 
management s estimates of future production and supply requirements may prove to be inaccurate  in which case inventory may be understated or overstated 
in the future  if the carrying value of the inventory were not realizable  we would be required to recognize write downs to net realizable value as additional cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
although management makes every effort to ensure the accuracy of its forecast of future production requirements and supply  any unanticipated changes in technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
the total writedowns during the year ended december   related to excess and obsolete inventory were million 
impairment of long lived assets our long lived assets include property and equipment  long term investments  goodwill and other intangible assets 
the fair value of the long term investments is dependent on the performance of the companies in which we have invested  as well as volatility inherent in the external markets for these investments 
in assessing potential impairment for these investments  we consider these 
table of contents factors as well as the forecasted financial performance of our investees 
we record an investment impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
during  we recognized million of impairment losses related to our long term investments 
as of december   the carrying value of our long term investments was immaterial 
in assessing the recoverability of our property and equipment  goodwill and other intangible assets  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
restructuring reserve in and  we reduced our workforce by and  respectively  and consolidated selected facilities in our continuing effort to better optimize operations 
in connection with the workforce adjustments  a restructuring reserve was established based on estimated costs for severance and outplacement  consolidation of facilities and legal and other costs 
due to the decline in the commercial real estate market  it was expected that abandoned leased facilities would be vacant for several quarters or through the end of the lease term 
if the facilities were subleased  it would be at rates below current contractual requirements 
we recorded a charge related to the facilities abandonment  based on the difference between the expected cash outflows and the expected cash inflows related to these vacated properties 
we periodically review factors such as further declines in the commercial real estate markets and our ability to terminate leases  and based on these reviews we adjust our restructuring reserve as necessary 
the remaining restructuring reserve as of december  relates to consolidation of facilities costs and will be reduced going forward by lease payments offset by minimal sublease income

table of contents provision benefit for income taxes net income loss before income taxes effective tax rate in  we recorded an income tax provision at an effective rate of 
the tax rate varies from the statutory rate primarily due to our having a full valuation allowance against our us based deferred tax assets 
this results in a tax provision based on current tax calculations in foreign jurisdictions and only nominal amounts in federal and state jurisdictions due to our substantial us net operating losses 
our tax rate further varies from the statutory rate as a result of nondeductible expenses and the effect of different tax rates in foreign jurisdictions 
we reassess the necessity of our valuation allowance on a periodic basis

during the first quarter of  there was a change in the tax law that increased the years to which we could carry back our tax loss from two to five years  resulting in a tax refund and tax benefit of million

the series b convertible preferred stock that we issued to vista contains certain participation rights 
eitf topic d  effect of participating convertible securities on the computation of basic earnings  requires those securities to be included in the computation of basic earnings per share using the two class method 
the two class method results in a lower per share calculation and since diluted earnings per share can not be greater than basic earnings per share  the reported diluted earnings per share and basic earnings per share for were the same 
pro forma diluted earnings per share is calculated as net income divided by the diluted weighted average shares outstanding for assuming the series b convertible preferred stock was converted into common stock on the preferred stock issuance date 
we use the pro forma diluted earnings per share in monitoring and evaluating our ongoing financial results and trends 
we believe this information is useful for investors because the two class method will not be applicable in light of the proposed conversion of the series b convertible stock 
as a result  we believe a review of the financial results using this pro forma disclosure provides important insights to our operating results and trends

we received million in net proceeds from this transaction 
this equity entitled the holders to receive cumulative dividends  which accrued daily at per annum 
on or after the tenth anniversary of the closing  we had an obligation to redeem each share of unconverted series b convertible preferred stock for cash at a redemption price equal to of the original purchase price plus accrued and unpaid dividends 
additionally  in the event that we declare a dividend or distribution to the holders of common stock  the holders of series b convertible preferred stock would have been entitled to equivalent participation on an as if converted basis in such dividend or distribution 
we believe that cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments will be sufficient to meet our operating cash needs for at least the next twelve months 
however  we continually evaluate opportunities to improve our cash position by selling additional equity  debt securities  obtaining and re negotiating credit facilities  and restructuring our long term debt 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders

risk factors we operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of risks  some of which are beyond our control 
you should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision 
the risks described below are not the only ones facing our company 
additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations 
you should also read the cautionary statements in this document  wherever they appear  as applying to all related forward looking statements 
risks related to our business we may experience a shortfall in revenues or earnings or otherwise fail to meet public market expectations in any particular quarter  which could materially and adversely affect our business and the market price of our common stock 
our revenues and operating results may fluctuate significantly because of a number of factors  many of which are outside of our control 
some of these factors include changes in demand for our products and services  a shift in the timing or shipment of a customer order from one quarter to another  product and price competition  our ability to develop and market new products and control costs  timing of new product introductions and product enhancements  
table of contents failure by our customers to renew existing support or maintenance agreements in a timely manner  if at all  mix of products and services sold  delay or deferral of customer implementations of our products  size and timing of individual license transactions  length of our sales cycle  changes in domestic and foreign markets  success in growing our distribution channels  acquisitions by competitors  and performance by outsourced service providers  and the costs of the underlying contracts of these providers  that are critical to our operations 
one or more of the foregoing factors may cause our operating expenses to be disproportionately high during any given period or may cause our revenues and operating results to fluctuate significantly 
based upon the preceding factors  we may experience a shortfall in revenues or earnings or otherwise fail to meet public market expectations  which could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and the market price of our common stock 
reductions in information technology spending could continue to harm our business 
our products typically represent substantial capital commitments by customers 
as a result  customer purchase decisions may be significantly affected by a variety of factors  including trends in capital spending for telecommunications and enterprise software  competition and the availability or announcement of alternative technologies 
weakness in global economic conditions in recent periods and related reductions in information technology  or it  spending have resulted in many of our customers delaying or substantially reducing their spending on contact center hardware  software and services 
if the weakness in the global economy were to continue or worsen  demand for our products and services would likely continue to decrease and our business would be harmed 
the convergence of voice and data networks has led to industry changes that we may not address successfully 
historically  we have supplied the hardware  software and associated support services for implementing contact center solutions 
contact center technology is undergoing a change in which voice and data networks are converging into a single integrated network 
our approach to this convergence has been to provide migration software permitting the integration of existing telephony environments with networks in which voice traffic is routed through data networks 
this integration is provided by a software infrastructure that requires enterprise level selling and deployment of enterprise wide solutions  rather than selling and deployment efforts focused solely on telephone communication 
this industry transition has caused us to change many aspects of our business and as a result we have had to make changes in our management and technical personnel  change our sales and distribution models  expand relationships with our customers as sales are now often made throughout the organization  modify the pricing and positioning of our products and services  address new competitors  and increasingly rely on systems integrators to deploy our solutions 

table of contents if we fail to successfully address the changed conditions in which we operate  our business could be harmed 
our product revenues are dependent on the success of a small number of product lines 
historically  sales of a small number of product lines have accounted for a substantial portion of our revenues 
demand for our products could be adversely affected by any of our products not meeting customer specifications or by problems with system performance  system availability  installation or service delivery commitments  or market acceptance 
we need to continue to develop new products and manage product transitions in order to succeed 
if we fail to introduce new versions and releases of products  or enhancements to our existing products  in a timely manner  customers may license competing products  we may suffer lost sales and we could fail to achieve anticipated results 
our future operating results will depend on the demand for our product suite  including new and enhanced releases that are subsequently introduced 
if our competitors release new products that are superior to our products in performance or price  demand for our products may decline 
our products may not be released on schedule or may contain defects when released which could result in the rejection of our products  damage to our reputation  lost revenues  diverted development resources and increased customer service and support costs and warranty claims 
any of the foregoing results could harm our business 
because we rely on our installed customer base for support contract renewals and much of our future revenues  those revenues could be significantly impaired if our existing customers do not continue to purchase and use our products and services 
we derive a significant portion of our revenues from support contracts 
as a result  if we lose a major customer or if a support contract is delayed  reduced or cancelled  our revenues would be adversely affected 
in addition  customers who have accounted for significant revenues in the past may not generate revenues in future periods 
we also depend on our existing customers to purchase new products that we introduce to the market 
we may not be able to obtain new customers to replace any existing customers that we lose 
we operate in an intensely competitive market that includes companies that have greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we do 
the market for our products is intensely competitive  and competition is likely to intensify as companies in our industry consolidate to offer integrated solutions 
our principal competitors currently include companies in the contact center market and companies that market traditional telephony products and services 
as the market develops for converged voice and data networks and products and the demand for traditional  telephony based call centers diminishes  companies in these markets are merging  creating potentially larger and more significant competitors 
many current and potential competitors  including avaya inc  cisco systems  genesys  a subsidiary of alcatel and nortel networks  may have considerably greater resources  larger customer bases and broader international presence than us 
consequently  we expect to encounter substantial competition from these and other sources 
we may not be able to adapt our products and services quickly or efficiently enough to respond to technological change 
the market for our products and services is subject to rapid technological change and new product introductions 
current competitors or new market entrants may develop new  proprietary products with features that could adversely affect the competitive position of our products 
we may not successfully anticipate market demand for new products or services or introduce them in a timely manner 
the convergence of voice and data networks  and of wired and wireless communications could require substantial modification and customization of our current products and business model  as well as the introduction of new products 
further  customer acceptance of these new technologies may be slower than we anticipate 
we may not be able to compete effectively in these markets 
in addition  our products must readily integrate with major third party security  telephony  front office and back office systems 
any changes to these 
table of contents third party systems could require us to redesign our products  and any such redesign might not be possible on a timely basis or achieve market acceptance 
we may experience difficulty anticipating demand for our products and services  which may cause our operating results to suffer 
the demand for and sales mix of our products and services depends on many factors and is difficult to forecast 
if forecasted demand does not develop  we could have excess production and capacity resulting in higher inventories of finished products and components and underutilized personnel  which would use cash and could lead to write offs of some or all of the excess inventories or returns  which could result in lower gross margins 
in addition  we may also incur certain costs  such as fees for excess manufacturing capacity and cancellation of orders and charges associated with excess and obsolete materials and goods in our inventory  which could result in lower margins 
if demand increases beyond what we forecast  we may have to increase production at our third party manufacturers or increase our capacity to deliver products and services 
we depend on our suppliers to provide additional volumes of components and those suppliers might not be able to increase production rapidly enough to meet unexpected demand or may choose to allocate capacity to other customers 
even if we are able to procure enough components  our third party manufacturers might not be able to produce enough of our products to meet market demand 
the inability of either our manufacturers or our suppliers to increase production rapidly enough or our inability to obtain qualified services personnel could cause us to fail to meet customer demand 
rapid increases or decreases in production levels could result in higher costs for manufacturing  supply of components and other expenses 
these higher costs could reduce our margins 
furthermore  if production is increased rapidly  manufacturing yields could decline  which may also reduce our margins 
we are involved in litigation which could be expensive and divert our resources 
we have in the past and continue to be involved in litigation for a variety of matters 
any claims brought against us will likely have a financial impact  potentially affecting the market performance of our common stock  generating costs associated with the disruption of business and diverting management s attention 
we are currently involved in a binding arbitration proceeding with electronic data systems corporation  or eds  in which eds is seeking million in damages and we are counterclaiming for our damages 
there can be no assurance as to the outcome of this arbitration 
in addition  there has been extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights in our industry  and we are periodically notified of such claims by third parties 
we have been sued in the past for alleged patent infringement 
we expect that software product developers and providers of software in markets similar to ours will increasingly be subject to infringement claims or demands for infringement indemnification as the number of products and competitors in our industry grows and the functionality of products overlap 
any claims  with or without merit  could be costly and time consuming to defend  divert our management s attention  cause product delays and have an adverse effect on our revenues and operating results 
if any of our products were found to infringe a third party s proprietary rights  we could be required to enter into royalty or licensing agreements to be able to sell our products  which may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
moreover  even if we negotiate license agreements with a third party  future disputes with such parties are possible 
if we are unable to resolve an intellectual property dispute through a license  settlement or successful litigation  we would be subject to pay damages and be prevented from making  using or selling certain products or services 
in the future  we could become involved in other types of litigation  such as shareholder lawsuits for alleged violations of securities laws  claims by employees  and product liability claims 
we are subject to risks inherent in doing business internationally 
we market our products and services worldwide and anticipate entering additional foreign markets in the future 
if we fail to enter certain major markets successfully  our competitive position could be impaired and we may be unable to compete on a global scale 
the financial resources required to enter  establish and grow 
table of contents new and existing foreign markets may be substantial  and foreign operations are subject to additional risks which may negatively impact our business including the cost and timing of the multiple governmental approvals and product modifications required by many countries  fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies  less effective protection of intellectual property  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  global economic climate considerations including potentially negative tax and foreign and domestic trade legislation  which could result in the creation of trade barriers such as tariffs  duties  quotas and other restrictions  longer payment cycles  and seasonal reductions in business activity in international locales  such as during the summer months in europe 
our failure to grow and maintain our relationships with systems integrators or vars could impact our ability to market and implement our products and reduce future revenues 
failure to establish or maintain relationships with systems integrators or vars would significantly harm our ability to sell our products 
systems integrators and vars market  sell  install and deploy our products  and perform custom integration of systems and applications 
if these relationships fail  we will have to devote substantially more resources to the sales and marketing  implementation and support of our products than we would have had to otherwise 
in addition  there could be channel conflict among our varied sales channels  which could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may experience difficulty expanding our distribution channels 
we have historically sold our products and services through our direct sales force and a limited number of distributors 
changes in customer preferences  the markets we target  the competitive environment or other factors may require us to expand our third party distributor  vars  systems integrator  technology alliances  electronic and other alternative distribution channels  and we have continued to work on such expansion in recent periods 
we may not be successful in expanding these distribution channels  and such failure could hurt our operating results by limiting our ability to increase or maintain our sales through these channels or by increasing our sales expenses faster than our revenues 
we are highly dependent on third party suppliers and underperformance by our suppliers could impair our business 
we have outsourced our manufacturing capabilities to third parties and rely on those suppliers to order components  build  configure and test systems and subassemblies  and ship products to meet our customers delivery requirements in a timely manner 
failure to ship product on time or failure to meet our quality standards would result in delays to customers  customer dissatisfaction or cancellation of customer orders 
should we have performance issues with our manufacturing sub contractors  the process to move from one sub contractor to another is a lengthy and costly process that could affect our ability to execute customer shipment requirements and might negatively affect revenues and costs 
we depend on certain critical components in the production of our products and services 
some of these components are obtained only from a single supplier and only in limited quantities 
in addition  some of our major suppliers use proprietary technology and software code that could require significant redesign of our products in the case of a change in vendor 
further  suppliers could discontinue their products  or modify them in a manner incompatible with our current use  or use manufacturing processes and tools that could not be easily migrated to other vendors 

table of contents we also outsource certain of our information technology activities to third parties 
we rely heavily on these vendors to provide day to day support 
we may experience disruption in our business if these vendors or we have difficulty meeting our requirements  or if we need to transition the activities to other vendors or ourselves  which could negatively affect our revenues and costs 
we may experience difficulty managing changes in our business 
the changes we have experienced in the past and which may occur in the future in our business may place a significant strain on our operational and financial resources 
we may experience substantial disruption from changes and could incur significant expenses and write offs 
we must carefully manage accounts receivables to limit credit risks 
we must also maintain inventories at levels consistent with product demand 
inaccurate data for example  credit histories or supply demand forecasts could quickly result in excessive balances or insufficient reserves 
these changes have in the past and may in the future also place strains on our financial and reporting systems and controls 
if we fail to attract  motivate and retain highly qualified key personnel  our ability to operate our business could be impaired 
our future success will depend to a significant extent on our ability to attract  retain and motivate highly qualified technical  marketing  sales and management personnel 
competition for these employees is intense and the process of recruiting personnel with the combination of skills and attributes required to operate our business can be time consuming and expensive 
we have recently undergone significant changes in senior management and other personnel 
for example  our chief executive officer was appointed in january after having been named interim chief executive officer in august our failure to recruit  retain and motivate qualified personnel could be disruptive to our operations  and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
we intend to upgrade or replace certain parts of our information systems and may not be successful in implementing the changes 
we intend to upgrade or replace certain information systems that support our operations  including systems to manage order processing  shipping  support entitlement  accounting and internal computing operations 
many of these systems are proprietary to us and are very complex 
we may not be successful in implementing these new systems and transitioning data from our old systems to the new systems 
any failure or significant downtime in our information systems could prevent us from taking customer orders  shipping products  providing services or billing customers and could harm our business 
in addition  our information systems require the services of personnel with extensive knowledge of these information systems and the business environment in which we operate 
in order to successfully implement and operate our systems  we must be able to attract and retain a significant number of highly skilled employees 
if we fail to attract and retain the highly skilled personnel required to implement  maintain and operate our information systems  our business could suffer 
our intellectual property may be copied  obtained or developed by third parties 
our success depends in part upon our internally developed technology 
despite the precautions we take to protect our intellectual property  unauthorized third parties may copy or otherwise obtain and use our technology 
in addition  third parties may develop similar technology independently 
unauthorized copying  use or reverse engineering of our products or independent development of technology similar to ours by competitors could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents we depend on licenses from third parties for rights to the technology used in several of our products 
if we are unable to continue these relationships and maintain our rights to this technology  our business could suffer 
we depend on licenses for some of the technology used in our products from a number of third party vendors 
if we were unable to continue using the technology made available to us under these licenses on commercially reasonable terms or at all  we may have to discontinue  delay or reduce product shipments until we obtain equivalent replacement technology  which could hurt our business 
in addition  if our vendors choose to discontinue support of the licensed technology in the future  we may not be able to modify or adapt our own products 
regulatory changes and future changes to generally accepted accounting principles may negatively impact our business 
the electronic communications industry is subject to a wide range of regulations in the markets and countries in which we currently operate or may wish to operate in the future 
in addition  new products and services may involve entering different or newly regulated areas 
changes in these environments may impact our business and could affect our ability to operate in certain markets or certain regions from time to time 
revisions to generally accepted accounting principles or related rules of the securities and exchange commission will require us to review our accounting and financial reporting procedures in order to ensure continued compliance 
from time to time  such changes have an impact on our accounting and financial reporting  and these changes may impact market perception of our financial condition 
additionally  recently adopted or new legislation or regulations  including compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of  may lead to an increase in our costs related to audits in particular and regulatory compliance generally 
a failure to comply with these new laws and regulations could materially harm our business 
we may engage in future acquisitions or investments that could prove difficult to integrate with our business and which may impair our operations 
we have made a number of acquisitions in the past 
acquisitions or investments we make may experience significant fluctuations in market value or may result in significant write offs or the issuance of additional equity or debt securities to finance or fund them 
acquisitions and investments can be costly and disruptive  and we may be unable to successfully integrate a new business or technology into our business 
there are a number of risks that future transactions could entail  including inability to successfully integrate or commercialize acquired technologies or otherwise realize anticipated synergies or economies of scale on a timely basis  diversion of management attention  disruption of our ongoing business  inability to assimilate or retain key technical and managerial personnel for both companies  inability to establish and maintain uniform standards  controls  procedures and processes  governmental  regulatory or competitive responses to the proposed transactions  impairment of relationships with employees  vendors or customers including  in particular  acquired distribution and var relationships  permanent impairment of our equity investments  adverse impact on our annual effective tax rate  and dilution of existing equity holders 

table of contents our operations are geographically concentrated and we are subject to business interruption risks 
significant elements of our product development  manufacturing  information technology systems  corporate offices and support functions are concentrated in san jose  california  nashville  tennesse and chelmsford  massachusetts 
significant sales  administrative and support functions and related infrastructure to support our international operations are also concentrated at our uk offices 
in the event of a natural disaster  such as an earthquake or flood  or localized extended outages of critical utilities or transportation systems that affects us  our customers or our suppliers  we could experience a significant business interruption 
acts of terrorism and international political instability may impact our business 
the threat of terrorist attacks and increased international political instability in various locations around the world have created uncertainty within the worldwide economic environment 
such uncertainty may halt or hinder our ability to do business  may increase our costs and may result in reduced spending by our customers 
fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies could result in currency transaction losses 
as we expand our international operations  we expect that our international business will increasingly be conducted in foreign currencies 
fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies relative to the united states dollar have caused  and we expect such fluctuations to continue to increasingly cause  currency transaction gains and losses 
we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future quarterly and annual operating results 
we may experience currency losses in the future 
risks related to our common stock the market price for our common stock may be particularly volatile  and our shareholders may be unable to resell their shares at a profit 
the market price of our common stock has been subject to significant fluctuations and may continue to fluctuate or decline 
from january  to december   the closing price per share of our common stock has ranged from a low of to a high of 
the stock markets have experienced significant price and trading volume fluctuations 
the market for technology has been extremely volatile and frequently reaches levels that bear no relationship to the past or present operating performance of those companies 
general economic conditions  such as recession or interest rate or currency rate fluctuations in the united states or abroad  could negatively affect the market price of our common stock 
in addition  our operating results may be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors 
if this were to occur  the market price of our common stock would likely significantly decrease 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against that company 
such litigation could result in substantial cost and a diversion of management s attention and resources 
the market price of our common stock may fluctuate in response to various factors  some of which are beyond our control 
these factors include  but are not limited to  the following changes in market valuations or earnings of our competitors or other technology companies  actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results  changes in financial estimates or investment recommendations by securities analysts who follow our business  technological advances or introduction of new products by us or our competitors  the loss of key personnel  our sale of common stock or other securities in the future  intellectual property or litigation developments  changes in business or regulatory conditions  
table of contents the trading volume of our common stock  and disruptions in the geopolitical environment  including war in the middle east or elsewhere or acts of terrorism in the united states or elsewhere 
vista has been granted certain veto rights as to particular corporate actions and owns a significant percentage of our common stock 
vista s ownership of our series b convertible preferred stock together with its right to nominate two directors provides vista with a substantial degree of control over our operations 
additionally  many significant corporate matters require vista s consent  including the issuance of additional capital stock  a sale of all or substantially all of our assets  the consummation of any transaction the result of which is that any person becomes the beneficial owner of more than fifty percent of our voting securities  the incurrence of certain indebtedness  a voluntary liquidation or dissolution  acquisitions by us of any material interest in any company  business or joint venture  the consummation of certain related party transactions by us  the execution by us of any agreement which restricts our right to comply with certain of our obligations to vista  the approval of our annual budget or any material deviations from our annual budget  the declaration or payment of any dividends or distributions on our common stock  or a change in the compensation paid to  the termination of the employment of  or the replacement of  certain of our executive officers including our chief executive officer 
if vista viewed these matters differently from us  we might not be able to accomplish specific corporate actions  and this failure could harm our business 
we have implemented anti takeover provisions that could make it more difficult to acquire us 
our articles of incorporation  our bylaws and our shareholder rights plan contain provisions that may inhibit potential acquisition bids for us and prevent changes in our management 
certain provisions of our charter documents could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control transactions 
these provisions of our charter documents could have the effect of discouraging others from making tender offers for our shares  and as a result  these provisions may prevent the market price of our common stock from reflecting the effects of actual or rumored takeover attempts 
these provisions may also prevent changes in our management 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risk from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
we manage our exposure to these and other risks through our regular operating and financing activities and  when appropriate  through our hedging activities 
our policy is not to use hedges or other derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
we deal with a diversified group of major financial institutions to limit the risk of non performance by any one institution on any financial instrument 
separate from our financial hedging activities discussed below  material changes in foreign exchange rates  interest rates  and  to a lesser extent  commodity prices could cause significant changes 
these changes could affect costs to manufacture and deliver our products and in our customers buying practices 
we have not substantially changed our risk management practices during and do not currently anticipate significant changes in financial market risk exposures in the near future that would require us to change our risk management practices 
debt and interest expense our outstanding line of credit of million under the credit agreement with comerica bank california and cit business credit is sensitive to changes in interest rates 
a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical movement in interest rates applied to our outstanding line of credit balance as of december   indicated that such market movement would not have a material effect on our operating results 
the interest rate on our million loan that is secured by our san jose  california buildings is re measured semi annually at the libor rate plus subject to a floor of and a ceiling of 
as a hypothetical movement in the libor rate would not increase the sum of the libor rate plus above the floor rate of  the interest expense relating to this loan would not be materially impacted by a hypothetical movement in interest rates 

table of contents foreign currency exchange revenues generated from international operations are generally denominated in foreign currencies 
we enter into outright forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge against fluctuations of significant intercompany account balances and monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a non functional currency 
in general  these contracts have maturities of one month or less 
market value gains and losses on these hedge contracts are substantially offset by fluctuations in the underlying balances being hedged  and the net financial impact has not been material in any of the three years presented 
as of december   our primary net foreign currency market exposures included euros  british pounds  and australian dollars 
a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical movement in foreign exchange rates applied to our hedging contracts as of december   indicated that these market movements would not have a material effect on our business  operating results  or financial condition 
actual gains or losses in the future may differ materially from this analysis  depending on actual changes in the timing and amount of interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate movements and our actual balances and hedges 
foreign currency rate fluctuations can impact the us dollar translation of our foreign operations in our consolidated financial statements 
in  these fluctuations have not been material to our operating results 
interest and investment income our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
our investments are in debt instruments of the us government and its agencies  and in high quality corporate issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
these investments are subject to interest rate risk  and could decline in value if interest rates increase 
the average duration of our investment portfolio as of december  was years 
due to the short duration and conservative nature of these instruments  we believe an immediate change in interest rates would be immaterial to our operating results
