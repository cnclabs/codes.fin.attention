item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general general cable is a leader in the development  design  manufacture  marketing and distribution of copper  aluminum and fiber optic wire and cable products for the energy  industrial specialty and communications markets 
energy cables include low  medium and high voltage power distribution and power transmission products for overhead and buried applications 
industrial specialty wire and cable products conduct electrical current for industrial  oem  commercial and residential power and control applications 
communications wire and cable products transmit low voltage signals for voice  data  video and control applications 
general cable operates its businesses in three main geographic regions north america  europe and oceania 
the following table sets forth net sales and operating income by geographic region for the periods presented  in millions of dollars year ended december  amount amount amount net sales north america europe oceania total net sales operating income north america europe oceania subtotal corporate and other operating items total operating income approximately of net sales in europe and oceania are derived from energy and industrial specialty cable sales 
as a result  these businesses have not been significantly impacted by the global telecommunications spending downturn and the european business specifically is currently benefiting from medium voltage energy cable capacity shortage in europe and a shift towards environmentally friendly cables 
general cable s reported net sales are directly influenced by the price of copper and to a lesser extent aluminum 
the price of copper and aluminum has historically been subject to considerable volatility 
however  metals prices have been relatively stable over the last three years with the daily selling price of copper cathode on the comex averaging per pound in  per pound in and per pound in and the daily price of aluminum rod averaging per pound in  per pound in and per pound in general cable generally passes changes in copper and aluminum prices along to its customers  although there are timing delays of varying lengths depending upon the volatility of metals prices  the type of product  competitive conditions and particular customer arrangements 
a significant portion of the company s energy and communications business and to a lesser extent the company s industrial business has metal escalators written into customer contracts under a variety of price setting and recovery formulas 
the remainder of the company s business requires that higher metal prices be recovered through negotiated price increases 
in these instances  the ability to increase prices may lag the movement in metal prices by a period of time as the price increases are implemented 
as a result of this and a number of other practices intended to match copper and aluminum purchases with sales  profitability has historically not been significantly affected by changes in copper and aluminum prices 

table of contents a pound of copper as quoted by comex was approximately in late february which represents an approximate increase over the price quoted at the end of the third quarter of aluminum has increased by over the same period of time 
the company is currently attempting to increase selling prices in many of its markets in order to offset the negative effect of increased metal prices 
however  the company s ability to ultimately realize these price increases will be influenced by competitive conditions in its markets  many of which have significant underutilized manufacturing capacity 
in addition  a continuing rise in metal prices  when combined with the normal lag time between an announced price increase and its effective date in the market  may result in the company not fully recovering increased metal costs 
if the company were not able to adequately increase selling prices in a period of rising metals costs  the company would experience a decrease in reported earnings 
general cable does not engage in speculative metals trading or other speculative activities 
also  the company does not engage in activities to hedge the underlying value of its copper and aluminum inventory 
general cable generally has experienced and expects to continue to experience certain seasonal trends in sales and cash flow 
larger amounts of cash are generally required during the first and second quarters of the year to build inventories in anticipation of higher demand during the spring and summer months  when construction activity increases 
in general  receivables related to higher sales activity during the spring and summer months are collected during the fourth quarter of the year 
current business environment general cable is operating in a difficult business environment in north america 
the wire and cable industry is competitive  mature and cost driven 
in many business segments  there is little differentiation among industry participants from a manufacturing or technology standpoint 
in addition to these general industry conditions  in the industrial specialty segment  industrial construction spending in north america  which influences industrial cable demand  is significantly less than the past ten year peak level 
however  this segment is also experiencing stable demand for cables utilized in industrial repairs and maintenance and the automotive aftermarket 
the communications segment has experienced a significant decline from historical spending levels for outside plant telecommunications products and a weak market for switching local area networking cables 
the company believes sales for communications wire and cable products will increase over time because current levels of spending by communication wire and cable customers are insufficient to maintain their network infrastructures 
in addition  the power outages in the us  canada and europe emphasized a need to upgrade the power transmission infrastructure used by electric utilities  which may  over time  cause an increase in demand for general cable s products 
general cable believes its investment in lean six sigma training  coupled with effectively utilized manufacturing assets  provides a cost advantage compared to many of its competitors and generates costs savings which help offset rising raw material prices and other general economic cost increases 
in addition  general cable s customer and supplier integration capabilities  one stop selling  and geographic and product balance are sources of competitive advantage 
as a result  the company believes it is well positioned  relative to its competitors  in the current difficult business environment 
as part of general cable s ongoing efforts to reduce total operating costs  the company continuously evaluates its ability to more efficiently utilize existing manufacturing capacity 
such evaluation includes the costs associated with and benefits to be derived from the combination of existing manufacturing assets into fewer plant locations and the possible outsourcing of certain manufacturing processes 
during the first quarter of  general cable closed one of its communication cable plants and incurred a pre tax charge of approximately million in that quarter 
in the second quarter of  the company incurred a pre tax charge of million in conjunction with the closure of two additional communication cables plants 
during the fourth quarter of  the company incurred a million pre tax charge related to the rationalization of certain of its industrial cable manufacturing plants 
additional charges currently estimated to be million  of which approximately million will be cash payments will be incurred during as the operations are wound down 
in addition  the company is currently evaluating the closure of another north american facility 
the company plans to announce the results of its evaluation in and would take additional charges currently estimated to be million  of which approximately million will be cash payments over the period the operations are wound down should it be decided to rationalize the facility 
acquisitions and divestitures general cable actively seeks to identify key trends in the industry to migrate its business to capitalize on expanding markets and new niche markets or exit declining or non strategic markets in order to achieve better returns 
the company also sets aggressive performance targets for its business and intends to refocus or divest those activities which fail to meet targets or do not fit long term strategies 
during  general cable acquired the worldwide energy cable and cable systems businesses of balfour beatty plc  formerly known as bicc plc  with operations in the united states  canada  europe  africa  the middle east and asia pacific 

table of contents this acquisition was completed in three phases during for a total payment of million 
the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase  and accordingly  the results of operations of the acquired businesses are included in the consolidated financial statements for periods after the respective closing dates 
in december  the company decided to sell certain business units due to their deteriorating operating performance

the closing adjustments included changes in net assets of the businesses sold since november   resulting from operating losses and other adjustments as defined in the sale agreement 
the businesses sold were acquired from bicc plc during and consisted primarily of the operations in the united kingdom  italy and africa and a joint venture interest in malaysia 
gross proceeds of million were received during the third quarter of as a down payment against the final post closing adjusted purchase price 
during the third quarter of  the final post closing adjusted purchase price was agreed as million resulting in a payment of million to pirelli

in september  the company announced its decision to exit the consumer cordsets business 
as a result of this decision  the company closed its montoursville  pennsylvania plant 
this facility manufactured cordset products including indoor and outdoor extension cords  temporary lighting and extension cord accessories 
in october  the company sold substantially all of the manufacturing assets and inventory of its building wire business to southwire company for million of cash proceeds and the transfer to the company of certain data communication cable manufacturing equipment 
under the building wire sale agreement  southwire purchased the inventory and substantially all of the property  plant and equipment located at the company s watkinsville  georgia and kingman  arizona facilities and the wire and cable manufacturing equipment at the company s plano  texas facility 
the company retained and continues to operate the copper rod mill in plano  however it has closed the plano wire mill 
the assets sold were used in manufacturing building wire products principally for the retail and electrical distribution markets 
during the second quarter of  the final purchase price for this transaction was agreed resulting in a deminimis cash payment to southwire 
proceeds from the transaction have been used to reduce the company s outstanding debt 
beginning in the third quarter of  the company reported the building wire and cordsets segment as discontinued operations for financial reporting purposes 
administrative expenses formerly allocated to this segment are now reported in the continuing operations segments 
prior periods presented reflect this change 
during the second quarter of  general cable formed a joint venture company to manufacture and market fiber optic cables 
general cable contributed assets  primarily inventory and machinery and equipment  to a subsidiary company which was then contributed to the joint venture in exchange for a million note receivable which resulted in a million deferred gain on the transaction 
the company will recognize the gain as the note is repaid 
at december  and  other non current assets included an investment in the joint venture of million and million  respectively 
the december  and balance sheets included a million note receivable from the joint venture partner in other non current assets and a deferred gain from the initial joint venture formation of million in other liabilities

critical accounting estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
a summary of significant accounting policies is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the application of these policies requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reflected in the financial statements 
management based its 
table of contents estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the critical judgments impacting the financial statements include determinations with respect to inventory valuation  pension accounting and valuation allowances for deferred income taxes 
inventory valuation general cable utilizes the lifo method of inventory accounting for its metals inventory 
the company s use of the lifo method results in its income statement reflecting the current costs of metals  while metals inventories in the balance sheet are valued at historical costs as the lifo layers were created 
as a result of volatile copper prices  the replacement cost of the company s copper inventory exceeded the historic lifo cost by approximately million at december  while at december   the historic lifo cost of the company s copper inventory exceeded its replacement cost by approximately million 
if the company was not able to recover the lifo value of its inventory at a profit in some future period when replacement costs were lower than the lifo value of the inventory  the company would be required to take a charge to recognize in its income statement all or a portion of the higher lifo value of the inventory 
additionally  if lifo inventory quantities are reduced in a period when replacement costs are lower than the lifo value of the inventory  the company would experience a decline in reported earnings 
conversely  if lifo inventory quantities are reduced in a period when replacement costs exceed the lifo value of the inventory  the company would experience an increase in reported earnings 
during and  general cable recorded a million charge and a million charge  respectively  for the liquidation of lifo inventory in north america as the company reduced its inventory levels 
the company expects to further reduce inventory quantities during which may result in an additional lifo liquidation charge or benefit 
the amount of the charge or benefit to be incurred in will be dependent upon the quantity of the inventory reduction and the market price of the metals at the time of the inventory liquidation 
pension accounting pension expense for the defined benefit pension plans sponsored by general cable is determined based upon a number of actuarial assumptions  including an expected long term rate of return on assets of 
this assumption was based on input from actuaries  including their review of historical year  year  and year rates of inflation and real rates of return on various broad equity and bond indices in conjunction with the diversification of the asset portfolio 
the expected long term rate of return on assets is based on an asset allocation assumption of allocated to equity investments  with an expected real rate of return of  and with fixed income investments  with an expected real rate of return of  and an assumed long term rate of inflation of 
because of market fluctuations  the actual asset allocations as of december  and were and  respectively  of equity investments and and  respectively  of fixed income investments 
management believes that long term asset allocation on average will approximate the company s assumptions and that a long term rate of return is a reasonable assumption 
the determination of pension expense for the defined benefit pension plans is based on the fair market value of assets as of the measurement date 
investment gains and losses are recognized in the measurement of assets immediately 
such gains and losses will be amortized and recognized as part of the annual benefit cost to the extent that unrecognized net gains and losses from all sources exceed of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market value of assets 
the determination of future pension obligations utilizes a discount rate based on a review of long term bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency which are expected to be available during the period to maturity of the projected pension benefit obligations  and input from our actuaries 
the discount rate used at december  was 
general cable evaluates its actuarial assumptions at least annually  and adjusts them as necessary 
in  pension expense for the company s defined benefit plans was million 
due to the effect of the unrecognized actuarial losses based on an expected rate of return on plan assets of  a discount rate of and various other assumptions  the company estimates its pension expense for its defined benefit plans will decrease approximately million from  primarily due to improved investment performance during a decrease in the assumed discount rate would increase pension expense by approximately million 
future pension expense will depend on future investment performance  changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the populations participating in the plans 
in the event that actual results differ from the actuarial assumptions  the funded status of the defined benefit plans may change and any such change could result in a charge or credit to equity and an increase or decrease in future pension expense and cash contributions 

table of contents deferred income tax valuation allowance general cable records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that it believes is more likely than not to be realized 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event the company was to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of the net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should the company determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in an amount that was in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made 
at december  and  the valuation allowance was million and million  respectively 
revenue recognition sales are recognized as revenue when the risk of loss and title pass to the customer  generally at the time of shipment 
most revenue transactions represent sales of inventory 
a provision for payment discounts  product returns and customer rebates is recorded within the same period that the revenue is recognized 
given the nature of the company s business  revenue recognition practices do not contain estimates that materially affect results of operations

these corporate charges were offset by million of income resulting from the reversal of unutilized restructuring reserves related to the closure in prior years of north american manufacturing facilities 
the net loss applicable to common shareholders for also includes a million charge related to the refinancing of the company s bank debt and a million foreign currency transaction gain resulting from a favorable change in exchange rates 
the net loss applicable to common shareholders for also includes a million increase in the tax provision in the fourth quarter of resulting from the company s refinancing 
in conjunction with the refinancing  certain of the company s foreign subsidiaries guaranteed the company s new revolving credit facility  resulting in us taxation of these foreign subsidiaries previously unrepatriated earnings and profits as a deemed dividend 
this is a non cash charge and does not result in a cash payment as the company will utilize net operating losses to offset the additional taxable income 
the net loss and net loss applicable to common shareholders of million includes pre tax corporate charges of million  of which million was recorded in cost of sales  million was recorded in selling  general and administrative expense and million was recorded in other financial costs 
the charges consisted of million to close two manufacturing plants in north america  million in severance and severance related costs worldwide  million to reduce to fair value certain assets contributed to the company s fiber

net sales the following table sets forth metal adjusted net sales by segment in millions of dollars 
net sales for the year have been adjusted to reflect the copper comex average price of and the aluminum rod average price of per pound 
metal adjusted net sales year ended december  amount amount energy industrial specialty communications total metal adjusted net sales metal adjustment total net sales net sales increased to  million in from  million in the net sales increase included an million favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes principally related to the company s european operations 
after adjusting net sales to reflect the increase in the average monthly comex price per pound of copper and the increase in the average aluminum rod price per pound in  net sales increased to  million  up from  million in the increase in metal adjusted net sales reflects a increase in the energy segment  a increase in the industrial specialty segment and a decrease in the communications segment 
the increase in metal adjusted net sales for the energy segment reflects a increase in net sales in the company s international operations and a increase in net sales in north america 
the company s international operations have benefited from increased sales resulting from new contract awards throughout europe and a million favorable impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the north american net sales reflects lower sales volume during the first half of offset by strong demand from power utilities for bare transmission wire in the fourth quarter of the sales volume in the first quarter of was also negatively impacted by unseasonable weather in the midwest and northeast  which affected the ability of the company s customers to install cables 
the company anticipates that sales volume for north american customers should continue to improve over time as utility customers address capital projects that were previously deferred 
these capital projects include enhancements to the power transmission and distribution grid 
during  these projects were not released as quickly as expected 
the company s management believes the timing of these projects has slowed in anticipation of pending energy legislation in the united states 
this legislation could provide future regulatory relief and allow north american utility companies to earn an adequate rate of return on their investment in upgrading the transmission grid infrastructure 
the increase in metal adjusted net sales in the industrial specialty segment was principally due to a increase in the company s international operations  growth in its domestic automotive aftermarket business and an increase in sales of industrial cables utilized in plant maintenance  repairs and operations 
the increase in net sales of our international operations includes a million favorable impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  the introduction of environmentally friendly cables in europe  an area in which our european operation is a leader 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in net sales of the north american industrial business  the result of the continued weakness in demand for cables utilized in new industrial construction and other major infrastructure projects 
however  net sales of these cables increased in the fourth quarter of compared to the same period in  the first year over year increase since the first half of which may indicate that the bottoming of demand has occurred 
the decrease in the communications segment metal adjusted net sales principally relates to a decrease in north american sales volume of telephone exchange cable and data communication cable 
metal adjusted net sales of telephone exchange cable were off for compared to however  sales to the company s three largest telephone operating company customers increased in the third and fourth quarters of compared to same periods in as a result of the company s position as a low cost producer  these products have historically been one of its most profitable business segments 
the sales volume decrease in data communication cables is the result of weak 
table of contents general information technology spending in north america 
the company believes that spending for data communication cable tends to lag other information technology infrastructure spending by six to nine months and therefore anticipates an improvement in demand for data communication cable during the second half of these decreases were partially offset by an increase in sales of electronics products resulting from sustained penetration into targeted niche markets 
selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative expense decreased to million in from million in this decrease reflects the impact of actions taken to reduce fixed sg a expense and controllable spending 
these actions were partially offset by increased medical and pension related costs experienced during and the impact of increased sg a expense in our european operations as a result of foreign currency exchange rate changes 
sg a expense for includes million of corporate charges related to plant rationalizations and the benefit of million related to the reversal of unutilized restructuring reserves 
in  sg a expense included million of corporate charges  primarily relating to the closure of manufacturing plants and severance costs 
operating income the following table sets forth operating income by segment  in millions of dollars 
operating income year ended december  amount amount energy industrial specialty communications subtotal excluding corporate charges corporate charges total operating income operating income of million for increased from million in this increase is primarily the result of reduced corporate charges in  as discussed above 
operating income also increased due to the company s ongoing cost reduction initiatives in sg a and manufacturing expenses  strong performance from the company s european operations and the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes and a million reduction in the lifo liquidation charge incurred in compared to offsetting these increases were reduced selling prices in the north american communications segment 
additionally  increased raw material costs most notably polyethylene which were not fully recovered during and higher pension and employee fringe benefit costs negatively impacted operating income 
other income other income includes foreign currency transaction gains which result from changes in exchange rates between the designated functional currency and the currency in which a transaction is denominated 
interest expense net interest expense  excluding other financial costs discussed below  increased to million in from million in the increase in interest expense is the result of higher interest costs under the company s former credit facility during compared to the prior year  partially offset by reduced interest costs under the company s new debt structure see previous refinancing discussion effective november  the increase in interest cost under the company s former credit facility was primarily the result of a higher credit spread for the company s borrowings due to the former credit facility amendment which became effective in october and the amortization of bank fees related to the amendment  partially offset by lower average net borrowings and lower interest rates on the floating rate portion of the company s debt 
as a result of the refinancing during the fourth quarter of  the company recorded other financial costs of million which consisted of pre tax charges of million for the write off of unamortized banks fees related to the company s former credit facility  million related to the early termination of interest rate swaps and million related to the early termination of the accounts receivable asset backed securitization financing

tax provision the income tax provision of million includes million related to a deemed dividend related to the guarantee by certain of the company s foreign subsidiaries of the company s new revolving credit facility 
the deemed dividend resulted in us taxation of previously unrepatriated foreign earnings and profits  thereby increasing the tax provision but will not impact cash tax payments as the company will utilize net operating losses to offset this additional taxable income

the increase of in metal adjusted net sales in the energy products segment is the result of higher volume in the north american market as the company realized the effect of new contracts won during and higher sales in europe as we continue to enjoy an increased presence with major european utilities 
during the second half of  the company benefited from contract awards won earlier in the year  including a two year supply agreement with lectricit de france  one of europe s largest electric utility companies 
this contract award for medium voltage energy cables commenced in june and is valued at the equivalent of approximately million through the company also benefited from its expanded position in the italian and united kingdom energy cables markets 
partially offsetting these volume increases was lower pricing in the north american market 
the decrease in industrial specialty products metal adjusted net sales includes the negative impact of the march divestiture of the pyrotenax business and the june divestiture of the company s extrusion tooling business 
excluding the impact of these businesses  industrial specialty products metal adjusted net sales decreased from the prior year 
this decrease is primarily the result of continued weak demand and pricing in many industrial sectors of the north american economy 
this decrease is partially offset by a increase in metal adjusted net sales for the company s international operations 
the decrease in communication products metal adjusted net sales principally relates to lower sales volume of outside plant telecommunications cable and to a lesser extent high bandwidth networking cables 
sales volume for outside plant telecommunications cable decreased year over year as many customers significantly reduced their capital spending in selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative expense increased to million in from million in the and sg a expense includes million of corporate operating expenses and million of corporate operating income  respectively 
excluding these expenses and income  sg a expense on a consistent basis decreased 
the reduction reflects the lower sales volumes and the impact of an aggressive program implemented since november to reduce fixed selling  general and administrative expense and controllable spending
