value added resellers  or vars 
we have entered into agreements to sell our products through more than resellers in approximately countries 
our value added resellers include regional networking system resellers  resellers who focus on specific vertical markets  network integrators and wholesale distributors 
we provide training and support to our resellers and our resellers generally provide the first level of support to end users of our products 
our relationships with resellers are generally on a non exclusive basis 
our resellers are not given privileges to return inventory and do not automatically participate in any cooperative marketing programs 
we generally recognize product revenue from our reseller and end user customers at the time of shipment  provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price of the product is fixed or determinable and collection of the sales proceeds is reasonably assured 
when significant obligations or contingencies remain after products are delivered  such as installation or customer acceptance  revenue and related costs are deferred until such obligations or contingencies are satisfied

table of contents field sales 
we have trained our field sales organization to support and develop leads for our value added resellers and to establish and maintain a limited number of key accounts and strategic customers 
to support these objectives  our field sales force assists end user customers in finding solutions to complex network system and architecture problems  differentiates the features and capabilities of our products from competitive offerings  continually monitors and understands the evolving networking needs of enterprise and service provider customers  promotes our products and ensures direct contact with current and potential customers  and monitors the changing requirements of our customers 
as of june   our worldwide sales and marketing organization consisted of individuals  including directors  managers  sales representatives  and technical and administrative support personnel 
we have domestic sales offices located in states and international sales offices located in countries 
international sales international sales are an important portion of our business 
in fiscal  sales to customers outside of the united states accounted for of our consolidated net revenues  compared to in fiscal and in fiscal these sales are conducted primarily through foreign based distributors and resellers managed by our worldwide sales organization  in addition to direct sales to end user customers  including large global accounts 
the primary markets for sales outside of the united states include the countries in western europe and japan 
although not a significant component of total revenues to date  we have also achieved sales growth in the people s republic of china  countries throughout the asia pacific region  south america  canada and mexico 
marketing we have a number of marketing programs to support the sale and distribution of our products and to inform existing and potential customers and our distributors and resellers about the features and performance of our products 
our marketing efforts include participation in industry tradeshows  technical conferences and technology seminars  preparation of competitive analyses  sales training  publication of technical and educational articles in industry journals  a publicly available website  web based training courses  advertising and public relations 
in addition  we are developing e commerce processes and systems for our resellers  distributors and end user customers 
we also submit our products for independent product testing and evaluation 
backlog our products are often sold on the basis of standard purchase orders that are cancelable prior to shipment without significant penalties 
in addition  purchase orders are subject to changes in quantities of products and delivery schedules in order to reflect changes in customer requirements and manufacturing capacity 
our business is characterized by seasonal variability in demand and short lead time orders and delivery schedules 
actual shipments depend on the then current capacity of our contract manufacturer and the availability of materials and components from our vendors 
we believe that only a small portion of our order backlog is non cancelable and that the dollar amount associated with the non cancelable portion is immaterial 
accordingly  we do not believe that backlog at any given time is a meaningful indicator of future revenue

manufacturing we outsource the majority of our manufacturing and supply chain management operations as part of our strategy to maintain global manufacturing capabilities and to reduce our costs 
we conduct quality assurance  manufacturing engineering  document control and test development at our main campus in santa clara  california 
this approach enables us to reduce fixed costs and to flexibly respond to changes in market demand 
we have a strategic partnership with flextronics international  ltd 
for the manufacture of our oem products in san jose  california and guadalajara  mexico 
flextronics manufacturing processes and procedures are iso certified 
our commitment with flextronics is formalized through a one year contract 
we design and develop the key components of our products  including asics and printed circuit boards 
we determine the components that are incorporated in our products and select the appropriate suppliers of such components 
flextronics utilizes automated testing equipment to perform product testing and burn in with specified tests 
together we rely upon comprehensive inspection testing and statistical process controls to assure the quality and reliability of our products 
we intend to regularly introduce new products and product enhancements that will require us to rapidly achieve volume production by coordinating our efforts with those of our suppliers and contract manufacturer 
although we use standard parts and components for our products where it is appropriate  we currently purchase several key components used in the manufacture of our products from single or limited sources 
our principal single source components include asics  merchant silicon  microprocessors  programmable integrated circuits  selected other integrated circuits  custom power supplies  and custom tooled sheet metal 

table of contents our principal limited source components include flash memory  dynamic and static random access memories  or drams and srams respectively  and printed circuit boards 
purchase commitments with our single or limited source suppliers are generally on a purchase order basis 
a number of vendors supply standard product integrated circuits and microprocessors for our products 
any interruption or delay in the supply of any of these components  or the inability to procure these components from alternate sources at acceptable prices and within a reasonable time  may have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
qualifying additional suppliers can be time consuming and expensive and may increase the likelihood of errors 
we use our forecast of expected demand to determine our material requirements 
lead times for materials and components vary significantly  and depend on factors such as the specific supplier  contract terms and demand for a component at a given time 
we order many of our materials and components on an indirect basis through our contract manufacturer 
research and development the success of our products to date is due in large part to our focus on research and development 
we believe that continued success in the marketplace will depend on our ability to develop new and enhanced products employing leading edge technology 
accordingly  we are undertaking development efforts with an emphasis on increasing the reliability  performance and features of our family of products  and designing innovative products to reduce the overall network operating costs of customers 
our product development activities focus on solving the needs of enterprises  service providers and metro markets 
current activities include the continuing development of a next generation chipset aimed at extending the capabilities of our products 
our ongoing research activities cover a broad range of areas  including  in particular  gigabit ethernet  metro and internet routing software  asic design  network management software  broadband access equipment and wireless networking equipment 
we have developed a new module operating system extremeware xos which has been designed to provide high reliability and availability 
this architecture allows us to leverage a common software architecture across different hardware and asic implementation 
we have utilized our ongoing investment in this area to develop and introduce new products and enhancements  and we intend to continue with this approach for future products and enhancements 
as of june   our research and development organization consisted of individuals 
our expenditures for research and development in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal were million  million and million  respectively 
competition the market for switches is part of the broader market for networking equipment  which is dominated by a few large companies  particularly cisco systems 
in addition  there are a number of large telecommunications equipment providers  including alcatel and nortel networks  which have entered the market for network equipment  particularly through acquisitions of public and privately held companies 
we expect to face increased competition  particularly price competition  from these and other telecommunications equipment providers 
we also compete with other public and private companies that offer switching solutions  including enterasys networks  foundry networks  inc  huawei technologies  com corporation  hewlett packard company and dell computer corporation 
these vendors offer products with functionality similar to our products or provide 
table of contents alternative network solutions 
current and potential competitors have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to develop and offer competitive products 
furthermore  we compete with numerous companies that offer routers and other technologies and devices that traditionally have managed the flow of traffic on the enterprise or metro networks 
some of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories and substantially greater financial  technical  sales  marketing and other resources  as well as greater name recognition and a larger installed customer base  than we do 
as a result  these competitors are able to devote greater resources to the development  promotion  sale and support of their products 
in addition  competitors with a large installed customer base may have a significant competitive advantage over us 
we have encountered  and expect to continue to encounter  many potential customers who are confident in and committed to the product offerings of our principal competitors  including cisco systems 
accordingly  these potential customers may not consider or evaluate our products 
when such potential customers have considered or evaluated our products  we have in the past lost  and expect in the future to lose  sales to some of these customers as large competitors have offered significant price discounts to secure these sales 
we believe the principal competitive factors in the network switching market are expertise and familiarity with network protocols  network switching and network management  product performance  features  functionality and reliability  price performance characteristics  timeliness of new product introductions  adoption of emerging industry standards  customer service and support  size and scope of distribution network  brand name  access to customers  and size of installed customer base 
we believe that we compete favorably with our competitors with respect to each of the foregoing factors 
however  because many of our existing and potential competitors have longer operating histories  greater name recognition  larger customer bases  broader product lines and substantially greater financial  technical  sales  marketing and other resources  they may have larger distribution channels  stronger brand names  access to more customers and a larger installed customer base than we do 
such competitors may  among other things  be able to undertake more extensive marketing campaigns  adopt more aggressive pricing policies and make more attractive offers to distribution partners than we can 
to remain competitive  we believe that we must  among other things  invest significant resources in developing new products and enhancing our current products and maintain customer satisfaction worldwide 
if we fail to do so  our products will not compete favorably with those of our competitors and that may have a material adverse effect on our business 
intellectual property we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights 
based on our commitment to build a patent portfolio  we have in process a number of patent applications relating to our proprietary technology 
we have filed patent applications in selected countries abroad as deemed appropriate 
there can be no assurance that these applications will be approved  that any issued patents will protect our intellectual property  or that third parties will not challenge these patents or applications 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that others will not 
table of contents independently develop similar or competing technology or design around any patents that we may obtain 
with respect to trademarks  we have a number of pending and registered trademarks in the united states and abroad 
we enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees  consultants and corporate partners  and control access to  and distribution of  our software  documentation and other proprietary information 
in addition  we provide our software products to end user customers primarily under shrink wrap license agreements included within the packaged software 
these agreements are not negotiated with or signed by the licensee  and thus these agreements may not be enforceable in some jurisdictions 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology 
there can be no assurance that these precautions will prevent misappropriation or infringement of our intellectual property 
monitoring unauthorized use of our products is difficult  and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our technology  particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
as detailed below under legal proceedings  we are currently engaged in litigation with lucent technologies  inc lucent 
lucent is asserting claims that allege infringement of certain patent rights  against which we are defending vigorously  but we cannot assure you that we will prevail in this litigation 
in addition to the litigation with lucent  in the normal course of our business from time to time  we are in discussions with companies that assert certain of our products require a license under a number of patents 
due to the number of companies with extensive patent portfolios in our industry who are or may be actively involved in licensing programs  we believe that even if we do not infringe any patents  we may incur significant expenses in the future due to disputes or licensing negotiations  though the amounts and timing of such expenses cannot be determined with any reasonable certainty 
as the functionality and features of our products expand  these disputes and discussions could increase or become harder to resolve 
employees as of june   we employed people  including in sales and marketing  in engineering  in operations  in customer support and service  and in finance and administration 
we have never had a work stoppage and no personnel are represented under collective bargaining agreements 
we consider our employee relations to be good 
we believe that our future success depends on our continued ability to attract  integrate  retain  train and motivate highly qualified personnel  and upon the continued service of our senior management and key personnel 
none of our personnel is bound by an employment agreement 
the market for qualified personnel is competitive  particularly in the san francisco bay area  where our headquarters is located

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business overview we develop and sell a family of modular and stackable network infrastructure equipment and offer related service contracts for extended warranty and maintenance agreements 
substantially all of our revenue is derived from the sale of networking equipment and the related service contracts 
we believe that understanding the following key developments is helpful to an understanding of our operating results for fiscal increased product breadth we believe that continued success in the marketplace will depend on our ability to develop new and enhanced products employing leading edge technology 
in fiscal we introduced several new products including the black diamond k  the summit altitude and the summit series  plus a new network software platform extremeware xos 

table of contents convergence of voice  video and data we have a vision of providing customers with the systems to build a converged communications infrastructure that can easily accommodate voice  video and data on a seamless wired and wireless network 
we believe that these two aspects of convergence the convergence of voice  video and data  and the convergence of wired and wireless are important underlying demand creators in the enterprise market 
in november  we announced our comprehensive strategic alliance with avaya  inc to jointly develop and market converged communications solutions 
the alliance brings together avaya s global market leadership in ip voice and telephony with extreme s expertise in high performance ip data network infrastructure 
under the joint development agreement the companies plan to develop next generation  standards based technologies in the areas of network management and provisioning  quality of service  security  and network resilience 
additionally  avaya will sell  service and support extreme s entire portfolio of data networking products through their worldwide sales organization and the avaya global services organization 
business environment in the late s and through  enterprises deployed a large volume of networking equipment in anticipation of high network traffic growth 
during this period  extreme experienced a period of rapid revenue growth 
subsequent to the global economy entered a recessionary period and the demand for information technology products declined as enterprises reduced spending on technology 
in particular enterprises cut their it budgets for networking equipment due to overcapacity as the anticipated increase in network growth in the years through early did not materialize 
we believe that this phenomenon adversely affected demand for our products and made it more difficult to accurately forecast demand for network equipment 
expanded focus on service offering extreme s service offering is primarily the provision of service contracts for extended warranty and maintenance agreements related to our networking equipment 
to a lesser extent  the service revenue includes professional services related to the design and installation of data networks and training 
in fiscal  we focused our service sales efforts on increasing the number of service contracts sold on new equipment and in the area of securing renewals on expiring contracts 
service revenue increased by in fiscal compared to fiscal and represented of total revenues in fiscal compared to in fiscal cost of service revenue decreased by million in fiscal to million and gross margins improved to from a negative in fiscal due to efforts to improve and optimize our service supply chain 
results of operations throughout fiscal  and  the primary factor that has impacted our operations and financial performance has been weak demand for networking equipment resulting from the continuing weakness of the global and us economies 
weak economic conditions persisted through most of fiscal  but beginning in the third quarter of fiscal  we began to see early evidence of strengthening demand for our products 
while it is too early to determine if this slow improvement in demand will continue  we believe that industry demand may be stabilizing and may be showing signs of returning to positive growth 
although our operations and financial performance were directly and adversely impacted by the economic factors described above  and despite the difficult economic challenges we faced during fiscal  we were able to achieve the following results we stabilized net revenues in fiscal of million  a decrease of from fiscal revenues of we recorded service revenue of million  an increase of from fiscal service revenue of million 
total gross margin in fiscal expanded to of net revenues from in fiscal 
table of contents we reduced our net loss in fiscal to million

product revenue was million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal  representing a decrease of in fiscal from fiscal and a decrease of in fiscal from fiscal the decrease in product revenue in fiscal from fiscal is primarily due to a change in mix in product demand  with both total units and average selling price remaining relatively stable 
the decrease in product revenue in fiscal from fiscal was due primarily to a significant reduction in our business in japan  along with a decline in units shipped and a decrease in average selling price 
we experienced some erosion of average selling prices of our products in fiscal compared to fiscal due to a number of factors  including competitive pricing pressures  promotional pricing and rapid technological change 
our average selling price will continue to be subject to such competitive pressure and can be expected to change rapidly 
service revenue was million in fiscal representing an increase of from fiscal service revenue of million 
the increase in service revenue in fiscal from fiscal is the result of our focus on increasing the number of service contracts purchased by customers  changes in our policies regarding service and increasing renewal rates 
service revenue in fiscal increased by from fiscal service revenue of million 
this increase was primarily due to the expansion of our customer base purchasing service contracts

the decrease in net revenues outside the united states in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to a reduction of sales in japan 
we expect that export sales will continue to represent a significant portion of net revenues  although export sales will fluctuate as a percentage of net revenues 
substantially all sales transactions are currently denominated in united states dollars 
we rely upon our two tiered distribution channel for the majority of our revenues 
revenue through the distributor channel was of total product revenue in fiscal and in fiscal the level of sales to any customer may vary from period to period  however  we expect that significant customer concentration will continue for the foreseeable future 
no distributor or customer accounted for more than of our net revenues in fiscal one customer  tech data corporation  who is a distributor of our products  accounted for and of our net revenues in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
cost of revenues and gross margin the following table presents the gross margin on product and service revenues and the gross margin percentage of net revenues for the fiscal years  and dollars in thousands year ended june  of net revenues june  of net revenues june  of net revenues gross margin product service total gross margin cost of revenues and gross margin are presented in total for the year ended june  since extreme networks did not track cost of product and service revenues separately in that year 
gross margin was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal  representing an increase of in fiscal from fiscal and a decrease of in fiscal from fiscal gross margin as a percentage of net revenues was  and in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
cost of product revenue includes costs of raw materials  amounts paid to third party contract manufacturers  costs related to warranty obligations  charges for excess and obsolete inventory  and internal costs associated with manufacturing overhead including management  manufacturing engineering  quality assurance  development of test plans  and document control 
product gross margin in fiscal was million  representing of product revenues as compared to million in fiscal  or of product revenue 
the increase in product gross margin in fiscal is due to a reduction in per unit product costs resulting from a consolidation of volume at a single manufacturer 
in addition  the fiscal gross margin was favorably impacted by a reduction in manufacturing overhead  warranty expense  reductions in scrap  rework  and was negatively impacted by increases in excess inventory expenses 
cost of product revenue in all periods includes the cost of our manufacturing overhead 
we outsource the majority of our manufacturing and supply chain management operations  and we conduct quality assurance  manufacturing engineering  document control and repairs at our facility in santa clara  california 
accordingly  a significant portion of our cost of revenue consists of payments to our primary contract manufacturer  flextronics international  ltd 
located in san jose  california and guadalajara  mexico 

table of contents the total gross margin in fiscal of million decreased by from fiscal of and was primarily due to the related decrease in revenue 
as a percentage of net revenues  gross margin was in fiscal and in fiscal fiscal gross margin was adversely affected by a higher than normal rate of warranty expense due to problems with various component parts within our products and our election  in some cases  to address those problems by replacing such products with new rather than refurbished replacements 
fiscal gross margin benefited by million relating to products sold that were written off in fiscal in the first quarter of fiscal  we recorded a charge of million related to an equipment lease in cost of revenues 
as part of our business relationship with mcms  inc mcms  a former contract manufacturer  in september  we entered into a million operating equipment lease for manufacturing equipment with a third party financing company  we  in turn  subleased the equipment to mcms 
due to the liquidity problems at mcms it filed for protection under chapter on september  on january   mcms completed an agreement to sell a majority of its assets to plexus corp 
for million 
our cost of service consists primarily of labor  overhead  repair and freight costs and the cost of spares used in providing support under customer service contracts 
service gross margin was million in fiscal  representing of service net revenue as compared to a negative gross margin of million in fiscal  a negative of service net revenue 
service gross margin in fiscal was negatively impacted by a number of programs that we implemented to improve service delivery productivity and to enhance customer satisfaction 
these programs included expenses incurred to increase service revenue and reduce service infrastructure  including outsourcing certain service functions 
the cost of service and gross margin in fiscal reflect the benefits we achieved from these programs 
as our service revenue represents more than of total net revenues for fiscal and fiscal  we have separately reported product and service gross margin 
the fiscal and fiscal service gross margin calculations include all service related expenses 
gross margin for fiscal is presented in total since we do not have records that detail product and service cost of revenue in separate categories 
furthermore  in the past  some service related expenses were included in operating expenses as part of the line item titled sales  marketing and service expense 
the erp system we implemented at the beginning of fiscal enables us to record cost of product and service revenue in separate detail 
we were able to identify the service expenses that had previously been included in operating expenses and  therefore  our fiscal results reflect the reclassification of million from operating expenses to cost of revenue 
such amounts represented of previously reported operating expenses for fiscal our product and service gross margins are variable and dependent on many factors  some of which are outside of our control 
some of the primary factors affecting gross margin include demand for our products  changes in our pricing policies and those of our competitors  and the mix of products sold 
our gross margin may be adversely affected by increases in material or labor costs  increases in warranty expense or the cost of providing services under extended service contracts  heightened price competition  obsolescence charges and higher inventory balances 
in addition  our gross margin may fluctuate due to the mix of distribution channels through which our products are sold  including the effects of our two tier distribution model 
any significant decline in sales to our resellers  distributors or end user customers  or the loss of any of our key resellers  distributors or end user customers could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  an increase in distribution channels generally makes it more difficult to forecast the mix of products sold and the timing of orders from our customers 
new product introductions may result in excess or obsolete inventories  which may also reduce our gross margin 
sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses consist of salaries  commissions and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and sales functions  as well as trade shows and promotional expenses 
sales and marketing expenses were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal  representing a 
table of contents decrease of in fiscal from fiscal and a decrease of in fiscal from fiscal the decrease in fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to a decrease in advertising and other promotional expenses of million as a result of cost cutting measures  a decrease in depreciation expense of million  a decrease in occupancy expenses of million  a decrease in salaries and related personnel expenses of million primarily due to lower sales commissions and a decrease in travel expenses of million 
the decrease in fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to lower sales commissions and a reduction of people in fiscal in our sales and marketing organization 
as a percentage of net revenues  sales and marketing expenses were in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal the rate of future spending changes in our sales and marketing expenses  if any  will depend on the pace of recovery in the market for networking products 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist principally of salaries and related personnel expenses  consultant fees and prototype expenses related to the design  development  and testing of our products 
research and development expenses were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal  remaining flat in fiscal from fiscal and representing a decrease of in fiscal from fiscal fiscal includes amortization expense of million related to the fair value of the warrant issued to avaya as part of the joint development agreement  offset in part by decreased payroll and personnel expenses of million  decreased engineering project expenses of million and decreased depreciation expense of million 
the fair value of the warrant allocated to the joint development agreement with avaya is million and will be amortized over a three year period beginning november  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
amortization expense related to this agreement is approximately million per fiscal quarter  the amortization expense related to this agreement in fiscal represents eight months of amortization 
the decrease in fiscal compared to fiscal was a result of tightening our focus on our core product lines 
as a percentage of total net revenues  research and development expenses were in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal the increase in these percentages in fiscal and fiscal was primarily the result of a decrease in our net revenues in fiscal and fiscal we expense all research and development expenses as incurred 
we believe that continued investment in research and development is critical to attaining our strategic objectives 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for executive  finance and administrative personnel  professional fees and other general corporate expenses 
general and administrative expenses were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal  representing an increase of in fiscal from fiscal and a decrease of in fiscal from fiscal the increase in fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to increases in legal fees of million relating to litigation and increases in other professional fees of million  offset by decreases in insurance expense of million and decreases in payroll and personnel expenses of million 
the decrease in fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to decreases in bad debt expense of million and rent expense of million offset by increases in professional fees of million and salaries and benefits of million 
as a percentage of net revenues  general and administrative expenses were in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal the increase in the percentage in fiscal was primarily due to the increase in legal expense and the increase in the percentage in fiscal was primarily the result of decreases in our net revenues in fiscal in june  we implemented a reduction in force and other expense control measures to reduce expenses  including general and administrative expenses 
the rate of any future spending increases in our general and administrative expenses  if any  will depend on the pace of recovery in the market for networking products 
legal expenses related to intellectual property litigation are expected to continue and may also cause general and administrative expenses to increase 
we increased expenses as a result of compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of  including section thereof  and expect to incur additional expenses in fiscal as we implement procedures to meet the requirements of this act 

table of contents impairment of acquired intangible assets during fiscal  we performed our annual evaluation of goodwill for impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
this evaluation indicated decreased expected future demand for the products associated with the goodwill and  therefore  we recorded an impairment charge of million  representing the carrying value of goodwill at that time 
there was no goodwill remaining as of june  or june  during the third quarter of fiscal  we evaluated goodwill and purchased intangible assets associated with recent acquisitions for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
the assessment was performed as a result of weakening economic conditions and decreased current and expected future demand for certain categories of products in the markets in which we operate 
as a result of the assessment  we recorded a charge to reduce goodwill and purchased intangible assets of million 
amortization of deferred stock compensation amortization of deferred stock compensation was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal  representing an increase of million in fiscal from fiscal and a decrease of million in fiscal from fiscal amortization of deferred stock compensation is attributable to unvested stock options subject to forfeiture issued to employees that we assumed in conjunction with acquisitions during fiscal deferred stock compensation is amortized as charges to operations  using the graded method  over the vesting periods of the individual stock options  generally four years 
upon termination of an employee  the amount of expense recognized under the graded vesting method that is in excess of the amount actually earned is reversed 
for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  we reversed million  million and zero  respectively  of excess compensation expense related to terminated employees 
amortization of goodwill and purchased intangible assets we recorded amortization of goodwill of million and amortization of purchased intangible assets of million in fiscal primarily related to acquisitions in fiscal and fiscal we adopted sfas as of july  sfas requires goodwill and certain other intangible assets to be tested for impairment at least annually and written down only when impaired  rather than being amortized as previous accounting standards required 
accordingly  as of july   we stopped amortizing goodwill with a carrying value of million 
this amount was subsequently written off due to impairment in fiscal restructuring charge during fiscal  we recorded restructuring charges of thousand in the quarter ended september  and million in the quarter ended june  related to excess facilities 
the excess facilities charge represents an increase to the charge initially recognized during the third quarter of fiscal the commercial real estate market has continued to deteriorate in fiscal and we have not been able to find suitable tenants to sublease these facilities necessitating an additional charge due to lower projected sublease receipts 
as a result of the excess facilities charges recorded in fiscal  rent expense in fiscal is expected to remain approximately the same as the fiscal levels 
during fiscal  we recorded restructuring charges of million 
the restructuring charges included excess facilities charges of million  severance charges of million and asset impairments of million 
the excess facility charge originally recognized in the third quarter of fiscal was increased due to lower projected sublease income caused by the deterioration of the commercial real estate market 
severance charges of million related to a reduction in total staff during the second quarter of fiscal of approximately people  or of the total workforce  across all departments 
severance charges of million related to a reduction in total staff announced at the end of fiscal of approximately people  or of the total workforce  across all departments 
the asset impairment charge relates to the write off of leasehold improvements and office furniture related to excess facilities 

table of contents during fiscal  we implemented a restructuring plan to lower our overall cost structure 
restructuring charges of million included a million charge related to the exit of two facility leases we entered into in june  excess facilities charges of million and asset impairments of million 
the excess facilities charges of million were the result of our decision to permanently reduce occupancy or vacate certain domestic and international facilities 
the asset impairment charge represented the unamortized amount of the assets at the date a decision was made to discontinue use 
these assets were not utilized subsequently or held for sale 
they were either scrapped or abandoned 
property and equipment write off during fiscal  we completed a property and equipment physical inventory in conjunction with the implementation of our new erp system 
the property and equipment physical inventory resulted in the identification of million of property and equipment whose fair value was determined to be zero because the assets were either no longer in service or were not identifiable 
therefore these assets were written off during the second quarter of fiscal interest income interest income was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal  representing a decrease of million in fiscal from fiscal and a decrease of million in fiscal from fiscal the decrease in fiscal from fiscal is attributed to lower interest rates offset by an increase in available investment balances due to increased cash flow from operations 
the decrease in fiscal from fiscal was due to lower interest rates 
interest expense interest expense was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal  representing a decrease of million in fiscal from fiscal  and an increase of million in fiscal from fiscal in december  we completed a private placement of million of convertible subordinated notes maturing in interest is payable semi annually at per annum 
the increase in fiscal from fiscal was due to a full year of interest expense on these notes 
other income expense  net other income expense was income of million in fiscal  expense of million in fiscal and expense of million in fiscal other income in fiscal was primarily comprised of cash settlements from vendors  net of related expenses  of million recorded in the first fiscal quarter and million recorded in the fourth fiscal quarter 
these settlements related to disputes regarding quality issues pertaining to components supplied for use in our products 
in addition  other income in the fourth quarter of fiscal includes a foreign consumption tax refund in the amount of million 
other expense in fiscal includes approximately million of amortization of costs associated with the convertible subordinated notes 
other expense in fiscal was primarily comprised of amortization of costs associated with the convertible subordinated notes of million and a write down of investments in privately held companies of million partially offset by realized gains on marketable securities of million 
other expense in fiscal was primarily comprised of write downs of investments in privately held companies that were accounted for under the cost method 
provision benefit for income taxes the provision for income taxes of million for fiscal was recorded for taxes due on income generated in certain states and foreign tax jurisdictions 
income tax benefits have been recorded on the fiscal pre tax loss and we have provided a full valuation allowance against such tax benefits 

table of contents the provision for income taxes of million for fiscal was attributable to million for taxes due on income generated in foreign tax jurisdictions and a million non cash charge to income tax expense recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal  representing a full valuation allowance for our net deferred tax assets 
we recorded this charge in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas  which places greater weight on previous cumulative losses than the outlook for future profitability when determining whether deferred tax assets can be realized 
based upon our most recent three year history of losses and relying on other guidance specified in sfas  we determined that it was appropriate to establish a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
this valuation allowance will be evaluated periodically and can be reversed partially or totally if business results have sufficiently improved to support realization of our deferred tax assets 
we recorded a tax benefit of million for fiscal the benefit for fiscal results in an effective tax benefit rate of  which consists primarily of federal and state income tax benefits offset by nondeductible goodwill 
critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item this annual report on form k 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the period reported 
by their nature  these estimates  assumptions and judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
we base our estimates  assumptions and judgments on historical experience  market trends and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
estimates  assumptions and judgments are reviewed on an ongoing basis and the effects of revisions are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period they are determined to be necessary 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the critical accounting policies stated below  among others  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we derive the majority of our revenue from sales of our modular and stackable networking equipment  with the remaining revenue generated from service fees relating to the service contracts and training on our products 
our revenue recognition policy follows securities exchange commission staff sec accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab 
we generally recognize product revenue from our value added resellers and end user customers at the time of shipment  provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price of the product is fixed or determinable and collection of the sales proceeds is reasonably assured 
in instances where the criteria for revenue recognition established by sab is not met  revenue is deferred until all criteria have been met 
our total deferred product revenue was million and million as of june  and june   respectively 
revenue from service obligations under service contracts is deferred and recognized on a straight line basis 
our total deferred revenue for services was million and million as of june  and june   respectively 
service contracts typically range from one to five years 
when sales arrangements contain multiple deliverables such as hardware  service contracts and other services  we determine whether the deliverables represent separate units of accounting and then allocate revenue to each unit of accounting based on its relative fair value in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
we recognize revenue for each unit of accounting when the revenue recognition criteria for each unit of accounting are met in accordance with sab the amount of product revenue recognized is impacted by our judgments as to whether an arrangement includes multiple units of accounting and if so  whether vendor specific objective evidence of fair value exists for those units of accounting 
the ability to establish vendor specific objective evidence for any unit of accounting could affect the timing of the revenue recognition 

table of contents we make certain sales to partners in two tier distribution channels 
the first tier consists of a limited number of independent distributors that sell primarily to resellers and  on occasion  to end user customers 
we defer recognition of revenue on all sales to these distributors until the distributors sell the product  as evidenced by a monthly sales out report that the distributors provide to us 
we grant these distributors the right to return a portion of unsold inventory to us for the purpose of stock rotation  provide them with credits for changes in selling prices  and allow them to participate in cooperative marketing programs 
we maintain estimated accruals and allowances for these exposures based upon our historical experience 
if actual credits to distributors for inventory returns  changes in selling prices and cooperative marketing programs were to deviate significantly from our estimates  which are based on contractual arrangements and historical experience  our future revenue could be adversely affected 
the second tier of the distribution channel consists of a large number of third party value added resellers that sell directly to end users and are generally not granted return privileges  except for defective products during the warranty period 
we reduce product revenue for certain price protection rights that may occur under contractual arrangements we have with our customers 
we provide an allowance for sales returns based on our historical returns  analysis of credit memo data and our return policies 
the allowance for returns reserve was million and million as of june  and june   respectively  for estimated future returns that were recorded as a reduction of our accounts receivable 
the allowance is charged to net revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
the allowance for returns reserve charged to net revenues was million in fiscal  zero in fiscal and million in fiscal if the historical data we use to calculate the estimated sales returns and allowances does not properly reflect future levels of product returns  these estimates are revised  thus resulting in an impact on future net revenues 
we estimate and adjust this allowance at each balance sheet date 
inventory valuation our inventory balance was million as of june   compared with million as of june  we value our inventory at lower of cost or market 
the networking industry is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions  changes in customer requirements and evolving industry standards 
we perform a detailed assessment of inventory at each balance sheet date  which includes a review of  among other factors  demand requirements  product lifecycle and product development plans and quality issues 
based on this analysis  we record adjustments  when appropriate  to reflect inventory at net realizable value 
inventory write downs charged to cost of product revenue were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments would significantly impact the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
in the future  if we find that our estimates are too optimistic and we determine that our inventory needs to be written down  we will be required to recognize such costs in our cost of product revenue at the time of such determination 
conversely  if we find our estimates are too pessimistic and we subsequently sell product that has previously been written down  our operating margin in that period will be favorably impacted 
accrued warranty networking products may contain undetected hardware or software errors when new products or new versions or updates of existing products are released to the marketplace 
we have experienced such errors in connection with products and product upgrades 
our standard hardware warranty period is typically months from the date of shipment to end users and months from the date of shipment to channel partners  which include resellers and distributors  and days for software 
upon shipment of products to our customers  including both end users and channel partners  we estimate expenses for the cost to repair or replace products that may be returned under warranty and accrue a liability for this amount 

table of contents our accrued warranty balance was million as of june   compared with million as of june  the determination of our warranty requirements is based on our actual historical experience with the product or product family  estimates of repair and replacement costs and any product warranty problems that are identified after shipment 
we estimate and adjust this accrual at each balance sheet date in accordance with changes in these factors 
the cost of new warranties issued that was charged to cost of product revenue was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal while we believe that our warranty accrual is adequate and that the judgments applied in calculating this accrual are appropriate  the assumptions used are based on estimates and these estimated amounts could differ materially from our actual warranty expenses in the future 
if actual expenses exceed those we have estimated  our future cost of product revenue would be adversely affected 
allowance for doubtful accounts our accounts receivable balance  net of allowance for doubtful accounts  was million and million as of june  and june   respectively 
the allowance for doubtful accounts as of june  was million  compared with million as of june  we continually monitor and evaluate the collectibility of our trade receivables based on a combination of factors 
we record specific allowances for bad debts in general and administrative expense when we become aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligation to us  such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration of financial position 
estimates are used in determining our allowances for all other customers based on factors such as current trends in the length of time the receivables are past due and historical collection experience 
we mitigate some collection risk by requiring most of our customers in the asia pacific region  excluding japan  to pay cash in advance or secure letters of credit when placing an order with us 
our provision for doubtful accounts was a benefit of million in fiscal  a benefit of million in fiscal and expense of million in fiscal if a major customer s creditworthiness deteriorates  or if actual defaults are higher than our historical experience  or if other circumstances arise  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could be overstated  and additional allowances could be required 
deferred tax asset valuation allowance we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
significant management judgment is required in determining our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we make an assessment of the likelihood that our net deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent that recovery is not believed to be likely  a valuation allowance is established 
during fiscal  we established a full valuation allowance for our net deferred tax assets in the amount of million 
in fiscal  the valuation allowance increased by million to million 
the valuation allowance was calculated in accordance with the provisions of sfas  which requires an assessment of both negative and positive evidence when measuring the need for a valuation allowance 
in accordance with sfas  evidence  such as operating results during the most recent three year period  is given more weight than our expectations of future profitability  which are inherently uncertain 
our net losses in recent periods represented sufficient negative evidence to require a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets under sfas this valuation allowance will be evaluated periodically and can be reversed partially or totally if business results have sufficiently improved to support realization of our deferred tax assets 
legal contingencies we are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings  including negotiations regarding potential licenses from third parties who have notified us that they believe our products may infringe certain patents 
periodically  we review the status of each significant matter  whether litigation or licensing negotiation  and assess our potential financial exposure 
if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered 
table of contents probable and the amount can be estimated  we accrue a liability for the estimated loss 
because of uncertainties related to these matters  accruals  if any  are based only on the most current and dependable information available at any given time 
as additional information becomes available  we may reassess the potential liability from pending claims and litigation and the probability of claims being successfully asserted against us 
as a result  we may revise our estimates related to these pending claims and litigation 
such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations  financial position and cash flows in the future 
for further detail  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of legal proceedings 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and marketable securities were million and million at june  and at june   respectively  representing an increase of million 
this increase was primarily due to cash provided by operating activities of million and proceeds from issuance of common stock of million  partially offset by capital expenditures of million 
we generated million in cash from operations in fiscal despite a net loss of million 
the net loss included significant non cash charges including a restructuring charge of million  depreciation of million and amortization expense related to the warrant issued to avaya of million 
accounts receivable increased to million at june  from million at june  days sales outstanding in receivables increased to days at june  from days at june  the increase in accounts receivable and days sales outstanding were primarily due to timing of collections and reductions in allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns reserves 
inventory levels increased to million at june  from million at june  this increase was the result of an increase in inventory related to three new product introductions within the fiscal year 
inventory management remains an area of focus as we balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels to ensure competitive lead times and avoid stock outs with the risk of inventory excess or obsolescence because of declining demand  rapidly changing technology and customer requirements 
deferred revenue increased to million at june  from million at june  this increase was due primarily to increased service obligations under service contracts 
we have a revolving line of credit for million with a major lending institution 
as of june   there were no outstanding borrowings under this facility 
the line of credit contains a provision for the issuance of letters of credit not to exceed the unused balance of the line 
at june   we had letters of credit totaling million 
these letters of credit were primarily issued to satisfy requirements of certain of our customers for performance bonds 
the line of credit requires us to maintain specified financial covenants related to tangible net worth and liquidity with which we were in compliance as of june  the line of credit expires on january  it is our intention to renew this line of credit when it expires 
as part of our business relationship with mcms  inc  a former contract manufacturer  we entered into a million operating equipment lease for manufacturing equipment in september with a third party financing company  we  in turn  subleased the equipment to mcms 
the equipment lease with the third party financing company requires us to make monthly payments through september and to maintain specified financial covenants related to profitability and our cash to debt ratio with which we were in compliance as of june  the liability related to this lease is included in lease liability on the consolidated balance sheets 
in december  we completed a private placement of million of convertible subordinated notes 
the notes mature on december  interest is payable semi annually at per annum 
the notes are convertible at the option of the holders into our common stock at an initial conversion price of per share  subject to adjustment 
the notes are redeemable in cash at our option at an initial redemption price of of the principal amount on or after december if not converted to common stock prior to the redemption date 
each holder of the notes has the right to cause us to repurchase all of such holder s convertible notes at of the principal amount plus accrued interest upon a change of control of ownership of extreme networks  as defined in the offering circular 
instead of paying the repurchase price in cash  we may  if we satisfy certain 
table of contents conditions  elect to pay the repurchase price in common stock valued at of the average of the closing prices of our common stock for the five trading days immediately preceding and including the third trading day prior to the repurchase date 
the following summarizes our contractual obligations including interest payments at june   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in thousands total less than year years years more than years contractual obligations convertible subordinated notes non cancelable inventory purchase commitments non cancelable operating lease obligations total contractual cash obligations we did not have any material commitments for capital expenditures or other non cancelable purchase commitments as of june  we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements as of june  we require substantial capital to fund our business  particularly to finance inventories and accounts receivable and for capital expenditures 
as a result  we could be required to raise substantial additional capital at any time 
to the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities  the issuance of such securities could result in dilution to existing stockholders 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of debt securities  these securities may have rights  preferences and privileges senior to holders of common stock and the terms of such debt could impose restrictions on our operations 
if we are unable to obtain such additional capital  we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned product development and marketing efforts  which would have a material adverse affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  marketable securities and cash available from credit facilities and future operations will enable us to meet our working capital requirements for at least the next months 
new accounting pronouncements consolidation of variable interest entities in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin 
fin requires that if an entity has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity  the assets  liabilities  and results of activities of the variable interest entity should be included in the consolidated financial statements of the entity 
for arrangements entered into after january   fin was effective immediately 
for arrangements entered into prior to february   fin was effective at the end of the period ending after december  in december  fin was revised to require application in financial statements of public entities that have interests in special purpose entities for periods ending after december  for all other types of variable interest entities  application was required for periods ending after march  the adoption of the provisions of fin  as revised  in fiscal did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
identification of impaired investments in march  the fasb approved the consensus reached on eitf issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments eitf 
the objective eitf is to provide guidance for identifying impaired investments 
eitf also provides new disclosure requirements for 
table of contents investments that are deemed to be temporarily impaired 
the accounting provisions of eitf are effective for all reporting periods beginning after june   while the disclosure requirements are effective only for annual periods ending after june  we have evaluated the impact of the adoption of eitf and do not believe the impact will be significant to our overall results of operations or financial position 
risk factors we are not profitable and we cannot assure you that we will be profitable in the future fiscal was the only year in which we have achieved profitability for the full year 
we reported losses for fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal we anticipate continuing to incur significant sales and marketing  product development and general and administrative expenses and  as a result  we will continue to need to rationalize expense levels and increase revenue levels to achieve profitability in future fiscal quarters 
a number of factors could cause our quarterly financial results to be worse than expected  resulting in a decline in our stock price our ability to control our operating expenses at a level that is consistent with anticipated revenue is significant to our financial results 
a high percentage of our expenses are fixed in the short term  so any delay in generating or recognizing revenue could cause our quarterly operating results to fall below the expectations of public market analysts or investors  which could cause the price of our stock to fall 
orders in our backlog at the beginning of each quarter do not equal expected revenue for that quarter and are generally cancelable at any time 
accordingly  we are dependent upon obtaining orders during a quarter and shipping those orders in the same quarter to achieve our revenue objectives 
in addition  the timing of product releases and purchase orders  and product availability  often results in a majority of our product shipments being scheduled near the end of a quarter 
failure to ship these products by the end of a quarter may adversely affect our operating results 
our customer agreements generally allow customers to delay scheduled delivery dates or to cancel orders within specified timeframes without significant charges to the customers 
furthermore  some of our customers require that we provide installation or inspection services that may delay the recognition of revenue for both products and services  and some of our customer agreements include acceptance provisions that prevent our ability to recognize revenue upon shipment 
we may experience a delay in generating or recognizing revenue for a number of reasons and our quarterly revenue and operating results have varied significantly in the past and may vary significantly in the future due to a number of factors  including  but not limited to  the following changes in general and or specific economic conditions in the networking industry  seasonal fluctuations in demand for our products and services  particularly in asia pacific and europe  linearity of quarterly sales have historically reflected a pattern in which a disproportionate percentage of such sales occur in the last month of the quarter  reduced visibility into the implementation cycles for our products and our customers spending plans  our ability to forecast demand for our products  which in the case of lower than expected sales  may result in excess or obsolete inventory in addition to non cancelable purchase commitments for component parts  product returns or the cancellation or rescheduling of orders  our ability to develop  introduce  ship and support new products and product enhancements and manage product transitions  announcements and new product introductions by our competitors  our ability to develop and support relationships with enterprise customers  service providers and other potential large customers  
table of contents our ability to achieve targeted cost reductions  our ability to obtain sufficient supplies of sole or limited source components for our products on a timely basis  increases in the prices of the components that we purchase  decreases in the prices of the products that we sell  our ability to achieve and maintain desired production volumes and quality levels for our products  the mix of products sold and the mix of distribution channels through which products are sold  downward adjustments resulting from other than temporary declines in the carrying value of long lived assets  costs associated with adjustments to the size of our operations  costs relating to possible acquisitions and the integration of technologies or businesses  and the effect of amortization of deferred compensation and purchased intangibles resulting from existing or new transactions 
on july  we hired a new senior vice president of worldwide sales 
while we believe we have strengthened our executive team and the overall organization  a recent high level of attrition in our sales group could adversely affect our sales 
in addition  the integration of new personnel into our sales organization  including our new senior vice president  will take time and the impact of their addition to extreme networks may not be realized in the near term 
due to the foregoing factors  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results should not be relied upon as an indicator of our future performance 
intense competition in the market for networking equipment could prevent us from increasing revenue and returning to profitability the market for networking equipment is intensely competitive 
our principal competitors include cisco systems  enterasys networks  foundry networks  inc  nortel networks and com corporation 
in addition  a number of private companies and foreign competitors have announced plans for new products  or have introduced products  that may compete with our own products 
some of our current and potential competitors have superior market leverage  longer operating histories and substantially greater financial  technical  sales and marketing resources  in addition to wider name recognition and larger installed customer bases 
foreign competitors may have competitive advantages due to significantly lower costs or strong ties to customers in their home countries 
these competitors may have developed  or may in the future develop  new competing products based on technologies that compete with our own products or render our products obsolete 
furthermore  a number of these competitors may merge or form strategic partnerships that enable them to offer or bring to market competitive products 
consolidation within our industry could lead to increased competition and could harm our operating results 
the pricing policies of our competitors impact the overall demand for our products and services 
some of our competitors are capable of operating at significant losses for extended periods of time  increasing pricing pressure on our products and services 
if we do not maintain competitive pricing  the demand for our products and services  as well as our market share  may decline 
from time to time  we may lower the prices of our products and services 
when this happens  if we are unable to reduce our component costs or improve operating efficiencies  our revenues and margins are adversely affected 
to remain competitive  we believe that we must  among other things  invest significant resources in developing new products  improve our current products and maintain customer satisfaction 
such investment will increase our expenses and affect our profitability 
in addition  if we fail to make this investment  we may not be able to compete successfully with our competitors  which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and future profitability 

table of contents when our products contain undetected software or hardware errors  we incur significant unexpected expenses and could lose sales network products frequently contain undetected software or hardware errors when new products or new versions or updates of existing products are released to the marketplace 
in the past  we have experienced such errors in connection with new products and product upgrades 
we have experienced component problems that caused us to incur higher than expected warranty and service costs and expenses  and to take an accrual for anticipated expenses 
such expenses adversely affected our recent results 
we have undertaken extensive efforts to address these issues  however until these programs are completed  these expenses are expected to exceed normal levels 
in the future  we expect that  from time to time  such errors or component failures will be found in new or existing products after the commencement of commercial shipments 
these problems have adversely affected our business and may have a material adverse effect on our business by causing us to incur significant warranty and repair costs  diverting the attention of our engineering personnel from new product development efforts  delaying the recognition of revenue and causing significant customer relations problems 
further  if products are not accepted by customers due to such defects  and such returns exceed the amount we accrued for defect returns based on our historical experience  our operating results would be adversely affected 
our products must successfully interoperate with products from other vendors 
as a result  when problems occur in a network  it may be difficult to identify the sources of these problems 
the occurrence of hardware and software errors  whether or not caused by our products  could result in the delay or loss of market acceptance of our products and any necessary revisions may cause us to incur significant expenses 
the occurrence of any such problems would likely have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we depend upon international sales for a significant portion of our revenue and our ability to grow our international sales depends on successfully expanding our international operations international sales constitute a significant portion of our net revenues 
our ability to grow will depend in part on the continued expansion of international sales 
sales to customers outside of the united states accounted for approximately  and of our net revenues  respectively  for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal our international sales primarily depend on the success of our resellers and distributors 
the failure of these resellers and distributors to sell our products internationally would limit our ability to sustain and grow our revenue 
there are a number of risks arising from our international business  including longer accounts receivable collection cycles  difficulties in managing operations across disparate geographic areas  difficulties associated with enforcing agreements through foreign legal systems  the payment of operating expenses in local currencies  which exposes us to risks of currency fluctuations  higher credit risks requiring cash in advance or letters of credit  difficulty in safeguarding intellectual property  political and economic turbulence  potential adverse tax consequences  and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  including compliance with us and foreign export laws and regulations 
in addition  conducting our business on a global basis subjects us to a number of frequently changing and complex trade protection measures and import or export regulatory requirements 
our failure to comply with these measures and regulatory requirements may result in the imposition of financial penalties and restrictions on our ability to conduct business in and with certain countries  which may harm our business and damage our reputation 
pursuant to regulations of the us department of commerce providing for voluntary disclosure  in the fourth quarter of fiscal we disclosed information regarding a possible violation of certain export 
table of contents regulations 
following such disclosures the department of commerce will determine whether to conduct an investigation 
if an investigation is commenced  we believe that these matters will be resolved without a material adverse effect on our business  and we have implemented procedures to reduce the risk of violations in the future 
our international sales currently are us dollar denominated 
recently the us dollar exchange rate has fallen against foreign currencies  in particular the euro 
however  future increases in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products less competitive in international markets 
in the future  we may elect to invoice some of our international customers in local currency which will expose us to fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and the particular local currency 
if we do so  we may decide to engage in hedging transactions to minimize the risk of such fluctuations 
we have entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to offset the impact of payment of operating expenses in local currencies to some of our operating foreign subsidiaries 
however  if we are not successful in managing these hedging transactions  we could incur losses from hedging activities 
we expect the average selling prices of our products to decrease  which may reduce gross margin and or revenue the network equipment industry has traditionally experienced a rapid erosion of average selling prices due to a number of factors  including competitive pricing pressures  promotional pricing and technological progress 
in addition  companies have lowered their prices in order to liquidate excess inventory that has accumulated as a result of the current economic slowdown 
we anticipate that the average selling prices of our products will decrease in the future in response to competitive pricing pressures  excess inventories  increased sales discounts and new product introductions by us or our competitors  including  for example  competitive products manufactured with low cost merchant silicon 
we may experience substantial decreases in future operating results due to the erosion of our average selling prices 
competitive pressures are expected to increase as a result of the industry slowdown that began in the first half of  coupled with the downturn in the broader economy 
to maintain our gross margin  we must develop and introduce on a timely basis new products and product enhancements and continually reduce our product costs 
our failure to do so would likely cause our revenue and gross margins to decline  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and cause the price of our common stock to decline 
some of our customers may not have the resources to pay for our products as a result of the current economic environment at june   no customer accounted for more than of our accounts receivable balance 
some of our customers are forecasting that their revenue for the foreseeable future will generally be lower than originally anticipated 
some of these customers are experiencing  or are likely to experience  serious cash flow problems and  as a result  may find it increasingly difficult to obtain financing  if financing is available at all 
if our customers are not successful in generating sufficient revenue or securing alternate financing arrangements  they may not be able to pay  or may delay payment of  the amounts that they owe us 
in particular  sales to the service provider market are especially volatile and continued declines or delays in sale orders from this market may harm our financial condition 
furthermore  they may not order as many products from us as originally forecast  or cancel orders with us entirely 
the inability of some of our potential customers to pay us for our products may adversely affect our cash flow  the timing of our revenue recognition and the amount of revenue  which may cause our stock price to decline 
the market in which we compete is subject to rapid technological progress and to compete we must continually introduce new products that achieve broad market acceptance the network equipment market is characterized by rapid technological progress  frequent new product introductions  changes in customer requirements and evolving industry standards 
if we do not regularly introduce new products in this dynamic environment  our product lines will become obsolete 
developments in routers and routing software could also significantly reduce demand for our products 
alternative technologies 
table of contents could achieve widespread market acceptance and displace the ethernet technology on which we have based our product architecture 
we cannot assure you that our technological approach will achieve broad market acceptance or that other technologies or devices will not supplant our own products and technology 
when we announce new products or product enhancements that have the potential to replace or shorten the life cycle of our existing products  customers may defer or cancel orders for our existing products 
these actions could have a material adverse effect on our operating results by unexpectedly decreasing sales  increasing inventory levels of older products and exposing us to greater risk of product obsolescence 
the market for switching products is evolving and we believe our ability to compete successfully in this market is dependent upon the continued compatibility and interoperability of our products with products and architectures offered by other vendors 
in particular  the networking industry has been characterized by the successive introduction of new technologies or standards that have dramatically reduced the price and increased the performance of switching equipment 
to remain competitive  we need to introduce products in a timely manner that incorporate  or are compatible with  these emerging technologies 
we are particularly dependent upon the successful introduction of new products 
we cannot ensure that any new products we introduce will be commercially successful 
we have experienced delays in releasing new products and product enhancements in the past that resulted in lower quarterly revenue than anticipated 
we may experience similar delays in product development and releases in the future  and any delay in product introduction could adversely affect our ability to compete  causing our operating results to be below our expectations or the expectations of public market analysts or investors 
our limited ability to protect our intellectual property may adversely affect our ability to compete we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights 
however  we cannot ensure that the actions we have taken will adequately protect our intellectual property rights or that other parties will not independently develop similar or competing products that do not infringe on our patents 
we generally enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees  consultants and corporate partners  and control access to and distribution of our software  documentation and other proprietary information 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise misappropriate or use our products or technology  which would adversely affect our ability to compete 
claims of infringement by others may increase and the resolution of such claims may adversely affect our ability to compete and our operating results our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
because of the existence of a large number of patents in the networking field  the secrecy of some pending patents and the issuance of new patents as a rapid pace  it is not possible to determine in advance if a product or component might infringe the patent rights of others 
because of the potential for courts awarding substantial damages and the lack of predictability of such awards  it is not uncommon for companies in our and similar industries to settle even potentially unmeritorious claims with very substantial amounts 
we expect to increasingly be subject to infringement claims asserted by third parties as the numbers of products and competitors in the market for network switches grow and product functionality overlaps 
we are actively involved in disputes and licensing discussions with  and have received notices from  others regarding their claimed proprietary rights  and as the functionality and features of our products expands  these disputes and discussions could increase or become harder to resolve 
the corporations with whom we have or could have disputes or discussions include corporations with extensive patent portfolios and substantial financial assets who are actively engaged in programs to generate substantial revenues from their patent portfolios  and who are seeking or may seek significant payments or royalties from us and others in our industry 
we cannot 
table of contents ensure that we will always be able successfully to defend ourselves against such claims or conclude licensing discussions on favorable terms 
if we are found to infringe the proprietary rights of others  or if we otherwise settle such claims or enter into licensing arrangement to resolve potential disputes  we could be compelled to pay damages  royalties or other payments and either obtain a license to those intellectual property rights or alter our products so that they no longer infringe upon such proprietary rights 
any license could be very expensive to obtain or may not be available at all 
similarly  changing our products or processes to avoid infringing the rights of others may be costly or impractical 
litigation resulting from claims that we are infringing the proprietary rights of others has resulted and could in the future result in substantial costs and a diversion of resources  and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
due to the number of companies with extensive patent portfolios in our industry who are or may be actively involved in licensing programs  we believe that even if we do not infringe any patents  we will incur significant expenses in the future due to disputes or licensing negotiations  though the amounts can not be determined 
we cannot assure you that any such expenses will not be material or otherwise adversely affect our operating results 
we are engaged in litigation regarding intellectual property rights  and an adverse outcome could harm our business and require us to incur significant costs we have received notice from several companies alleging that we may be infringing their patents 
one of these companies  lucent technologies  inc  filed a claim against us alleging patent infringement  and we are in litigation as of the date of this filing 
following examination of this claim  we believe it is without merit and we have responded accordingly 
without regard to the merits of this or any other claim  if judgments by a court of law on this or any other claim received in the future were to be upheld  or if we were otherwise to agree to the settlement of such claims  the consequences to us may be severe and could require us  among other actions to stop selling our products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property  obtain a royalty bearing license to sell or use the relevant technology  which license may not be available on reasonable terms or available at all  pay damages  or redesign those products that use the disputed technology 
if we are compelled to take any of the foregoing actions  our business could be severely harmed 
adjustments to the size of our operations may require us to incur unanticipated costs prior to the quarter ended april   we experienced rapid growth and expansion that placed a significant strain on our resources 
subsequent to that period  we have from time to time incurred unanticipated costs to downsize our operations to a level consistent with lower forecast sales 
even if we manage the current period of instability effectively  as well as possible expansion in the future  we may make mistakes in restructuring or operating our business  such as inaccurate sales forecasting or incorrect material planning 
any of these mistakes may lead to unanticipated fluctuations in our operating results 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to size our operations in accordance with fluctuations of our business in the future 
we must continue to develop and increase the productivity of our indirect distribution channels to increase net revenues and improve our operating results our distribution strategy focuses primarily on developing and increasing the productivity of our indirect distribution channels 
if we fail to develop and cultivate relationships with significant resellers  or if these resellers are not successful in their sales efforts  sales of our products may decrease and our operating results could suffer 
many of our resellers also sell products from other vendors that compete with our products 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to enter into additional reseller and or distribution agreements or that we will be able to successfully manage our product sales channels 
our failure to do any of these could limit our 
table of contents ability to grow or sustain revenue 
in addition  our operating results will likely fluctuate significantly depending on the timing and amount of orders from our resellers 
we cannot assure you that our resellers and or distributors will continue to market or sell our products effectively or continue to devote the resources necessary to provide us with effective sales  marketing and technical support 
most of our revenue is derived from sales of three product families  so we are dependent on widespread market acceptance of these products we derive substantially all of our revenue from sales of our summit  blackdiamond and alpine products and related services 
we expect that revenue from these product families will account for a substantial portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future 
accordingly  widespread market acceptance of our product families is vital to our future success 
factors that may affect the sales of our products  some of which are beyond our control  include the demand for switching products gigabit ethernet and layer switching technologies in particular in the enterprise and service provider markets  the performance  price and total cost of ownership of our products  the availability and price of competing products and technologies  our ability to match supply with demand for certain products  and the success and development of our resellers  distributors and field sales channels 
we may not be able to achieve widespread market acceptance of our product families  which could reduce our revenue 
future performance will depend on the introduction and acceptance of new products our future performance will also depend on the successful development  introduction  and market acceptance of new and enhanced products that address customer requirements in a timely and cost effective manner 
in particular  we are dependent upon the successful introduction of new products 
in the past  we have experienced delays in product development and such delays may occur in the future 
we have recently announced a third generation chipset for use in future products 
the introduction of new and enhanced products may cause our customers to defer or cancel orders for existing products 
therefore  to the extent customers defer or cancel orders in the expectation of new product releases  any delay in the development or introduction of new products could cause our operating results to suffer 
the inability to achieve and maintain widespread levels of market acceptance for our current and future products may significantly impair our revenue growth 
if a key reseller  distributor  or other significant customer cancels or delays a large purchase  our net revenues may decline and the price of our stock may fall to date  a limited number of resellers  distributors and other customers have accounted for a significant portion of our revenue 
while no distributor or customer has accounted for or more of revenue in the current fiscal year  sales to westcon corp  tech data corporation and hitachi cable ltd  represent a high percentage of our sales and these customers have individually accounted for or more of revenue in prior periods 
if any of our large customers stop or delay purchases  our revenue and profitability would be adversely affected 
our expense levels are based on our expectations as to future revenue and to a large extent are fixed in the short term  so a substantial reduction or delay in sales of our products to a significant reseller  distributor or other customer could harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
although our largest customers may differ from period to period  we anticipate that our operating results for any given period will continue to depend to a significant extent on large orders from a relatively small number of customers 

table of contents while our financial performance depends on large orders from a limited number of key resellers  distributors and other significant customers  we do not have binding purchase commitments from any of them 
for example our service providers and enterprise customers can stop purchasing  and our resellers and distributors can stop marketing  our products at any time  our reseller agreements are non exclusive and are for one year terms  with no obligation upon the resellers to renew the agreements  and our reseller  distributor and end user customer agreements generally do not require minimum purchases 
under specified conditions  some third party distributors are allowed to return products to us 
we do not recognize revenue on sales to distributors until the distributors sell the product to their customers 
the sales cycle for our products is long and we may incur substantial non recoverable expenses or devote significant resources to sales that do not occur when anticipated the use of indirect sales channels may contribute to the length and variability of our sales cycle 
our products represent a significant strategic decision by a customer regarding its communications infrastructure 
the decision by customers to purchase our products is often based on the results of a variety of internal procedures associated with the evaluation  testing  implementation and acceptance of new technologies 
accordingly  the product evaluation process frequently results in a lengthy sales cycle  typically ranging from three months to longer than a year  and as a result  our ability to sell products is subject to a number of significant risks  including the risk that budgetary constraints and internal acceptance reviews by customers will result in the loss of potential sales  the risk of substantial variation in the length of the sales cycle from customer to customer  making decisions on the expenditure of resources difficult to assess  the risk that we may incur substantial sales and marketing expenses and expend significant management time in an attempt to initiate or increase the sale of products to customers  but not succeed  the risk that  if a sales forecast from a specific customer for a particular quarter is not achieved in that quarter  we may be unable to compensate for the shortfall  which could harm our operating results  and the risk that downward pricing pressures could occur during this lengthy sales cycle 
we purchase several key components for products from single or limited sources and could lose sales if these suppliers fail to meet our needs we currently purchase several key components used in the manufacture of our products from single or limited sources and are dependent upon supply from these sources to meet our needs 
certain components such as tantalum capacitors  static random access memory  or sram  dynamic random access memory  or dram  and printed circuit boards  have been in the past  and may in the future be  in short supply 
we have encountered  and are likely in the future to encounter  shortages and delays in obtaining these or other components  and this could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet customer orders 
our principal sole source components include asics  microprocessors  programmable integrated circuits  selected other integrated circuits  
table of contents custom power supplies  and custom tooled sheet metal 
our principal limited source components include flash memories  drams and srams  and printed circuit boards 
we use our forecast of expected demand to determine our material requirements 
lead times for materials and components we order vary significantly  and depend on factors such as the specific supplier  contract terms and demand for a component at a given time 
if forecasts exceed orders  we may have excess and or obsolete inventory on hand or under non cancelable purchase commitments that could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
if orders exceed forecasts  we may have inadequate supplies of certain materials and components  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
we do not have agreements fixing long term prices or minimum volume requirements from suppliers 
from time to time we have experienced shortages and allocations of certain components  resulting in delays in filling orders 
qualifying new suppliers to compensate for such shortages may be time consuming and costly  and may increase the likelihood of errors in design or production 
in addition  during the development of our products  we have experienced delays in the prototyping of our chipsets  which in turn has led to delays in product introductions 
we cannot ensure that similar delays will not occur in the future 
furthermore  we cannot ensure that the performance of the components as incorporated in our products will meet the quality requirements of our customers 
our dependence on one contract manufacturer for all of our manufacturing requirements could harm our operating results if the demand for our products grows  we will need to increase our material purchases  contract manufacturing capacity  and internal test and quality functions 
any disruptions in product flow could limit our revenue  adversely affect our competitive position and reputation  and result in additional costs or cancellation of orders under agreements with our customers 
we rely on an independent contractor to manufacture our products 
the sole company we currently utilize for the manufacture of our products is flextronics international  ltd  located in san jose  california and guadalajara  mexico 
our commitment with flextronics is formalized through a one year contract 
we have experienced delays in product shipments from contract manufacturers in the past  which in turn delayed product shipments to our customers 
these or similar problems may arise in the future  such as products of inferior quality  insufficient quantity of products  or the interruption or discontinuance of operations of a manufacturer  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
we do not know whether we will effectively manage our contract manufacturer or that this manufacturer will meet our future requirements for timely delivery of products of sufficient quality and quantity 
we intend to introduce new products and product enhancements  which will require that we rapidly achieve volume production by coordinating our efforts with those of our suppliers and contract manufacturer 
the inability of our contract manufacturer to provide us with adequate supplies of high quality products may cause a delay in our ability to fulfill orders and may have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
moreover  our current dependence on a single manufacturer makes us particularly vulnerable to these risks 
as part of our cost reduction efforts  we will need to realize lower per unit product costs from our contract manufacturer by means of volume efficiencies and the utilization of manufacturing sites in lower cost geographies 
however  we cannot be certain when or if such price reductions will occur 
the failure to obtain such price reductions would adversely affect our gross margins and operating results 

table of contents if we do not adequately manage and evolve our financial reporting and managerial systems and processes  our ability to manage and grow our business may be harmed our ability to successfully implement our business plan and comply with regulations requires an effective planning and management process 
we need to continue improving our existing  and implement new  operational and financial systems  procedures and controls 
any delay in the implementation of  or disruption in the transition to  new or enhanced systems  procedures or controls  could harm our ability to record and report financial and management information on a timely and accurate basis  or to forecast future results 
in addition  rules adopted by the securities and exchange commission pursuant to section of the sarbanes oxley act of require annual review and evaluation of our internal control systems  and attestation of these systems by our independent auditors 
we are currently undergoing a review of our internal control systems and procedures and considering improvements that will be necessary in order for us to comply with the requirements of section by the end of this process will require us to hire additional personnel and retain outside advisory services and will result in additional accounting and legal expenses  which we has and may continue to cause our operating expenses to increase 
in addition  the evaluation and attestation processes required by section are new and untested  and we may encounter problems or delays in completing the implementation of improvements and receiving a favorable review and attestation by our independent auditors 
future changes in financial accounting standards may cause adverse unexpected revenue fluctuations and affect our reported results of operations a change in accounting policies can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective 
new pronouncements and varying interpretations of pronouncements have occurred with frequency and may occur in the future 
changes to existing rules or the questioning of current practices may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business 
in particular  if we are required to record stock option grants as compensation expense on our income statement  our profitability may be reduced significantly 
the current methodology for expensing such stock options is based on  among other things  the historical volatility of the underlying stock 
our stock price has been historically volatile 
therefore  the adoption of an accounting standard requiring companies to expense stock options would negatively impact our profitability and may adversely impact our stock price 
in addition  the adoption of such a standard could limit our ability to continue to use stock options as an incentive and retention tool  which could  in turn  hurt our ability to recruit employees and retain existing employees 
in addition  various accounting rules and regulations have been established over the recent past relating to revenue recognition 
these regulations frequently require judgments in their application  and are subject to numerous subsequent clarifications and interpretations  some of which may require changes in the way we recognize revenue and may require restatement of prior period revenue and results 
our business substantially depends upon the continued growth of the internet and internet based systems a substantial portion of our business and revenue depends on growth of the internet and on the deployment of our products by customers that depend on the continued growth of the internet 
as a result of the recent economic slowdown and reduction in capital spending  which have particularly affected telecommunications service providers  spending on internet infrastructure has declined  which has materially harmed our business 
to the extent that the recent economic slowdown and reduction in capital spending continue to adversely affect spending on internet infrastructure  we could continue to experience material harm to our business  operating results  and financial condition 
because of the rapid introduction of new products  and changing customer requirements related to matters such as cost effectiveness and security  we believe that there could be certain performance problems with internet communications in the future  which could receive a high degree of publicity and visibility 
as we are a 
table of contents large supplier of networking products  our business  operating results  and financial condition may be materially adversely affected  regardless of whether or not these problems are due to the performance of our own products 
such an event could also result in a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock independent of direct effects on our business 
compliance with changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expenses changing laws  regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure  including the sarbanes oxley act of  new sec regulations and nasdaq stock market rules  are creating uncertainty for companies such as ours 
we are committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure 
as a result  we are investing all reasonably necessary resources to comply with evolving standards  and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities 
we have been named as a defendant in a shareholder class action lawsuit arising out of our public offerings of securities in beginning on july   purported securities fraud class action complaints were filed in the united states district court for the southern district of new york 
the cases were consolidated and the litigation is now captioned as in re extreme networks  inc initial public offering securities litigation  civ 
no 
sas sdny  related to in re initial public offering securities litigation  mc sas sdny the operative amended complaint is brought purportedly on behalf of all persons who purchased extreme networks common stock from april  through december  it names as defendants extreme networks  six of our present and former officers and or directors  including our ceo the extreme networks defendants  and several investment banking firms that served as underwriters of our initial public offering and october secondary offering 
subsequently  plaintiffs and one of the individual defendants stipulated to a dismissal of that defendant without prejudice 
the complaint alleges liability under sections and of the securities act of and sections b and a of the securities exchange act of  on the grounds that the registration statement for the offerings did not disclose that the underwriters had agreed to allow certain customers to purchase shares in the offerings in exchange for excess commissions paid to the underwriters  and the underwriters had arranged for certain customers to purchase additional shares in the aftermarket at predetermined prices 
the securities act allegations against the extreme networks defendants are made as to the secondary offering only 
the amended complaint also alleges that false analyst reports were issued 
no specific damages are claimed 
similar allegations were made in other lawsuits challenging over other initial public offerings and follow on offerings conducted in and the cases were consolidated for pretrial purposes 
on february   the court ruled on all defendants motions to dismiss 
the court denied the motions to dismiss the claims in our case under the securities act of the court denied the motion to dismiss the claim under section a of the securities exchange act of against extreme networks and other issuer defendants  on the basis that the complaints alleged that the respective issuers had acquired companies or conducted follow on offerings after their initial public offerings 
the court denied the motion to dismiss the claims under section a and a of the securities exchange act of against the remaining extreme networks defendants and other individual defendants  on the basis that the respective amended complaints alleged that the individuals sold stock

table of contents networks defendants will not be required to make any cash payments in the settlement  unless the pro rata amount paid by the insurers in the settlement exceeds the amount of the insurance coverage  a circumstance which we do not believe will occur 
the settlement will require approval of the court  which cannot be assured 
if the settlement is not approved  we cannot assure you that we will prevail in the lawsuit 
failure to prevail could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows in the future 
in addition  we may become subject to other types of litigation in the future 
litigation is often expensive and diverts management s attention and resources  which could materially and adversely affect our business 
our headquarters and some significant supporting businesses are located in northern california and other areas subject to natural disasters that could disrupt our operations and harm our business our corporate headquarters are located in silicon valley in northern california 
historically  this region has been vulnerable to natural disasters and other risks  such as earthquakes  fires and floods  which at times have disrupted the local economy and posed physical risks to our property 
we have a contract manufacturer located in northern california and in mexico where similar natural disasters and other risks may disrupt the local economy and pose physical risks to our property and the property of our contract manufacturer 
in addition  terrorist acts or acts of war targeted at the united states  and specifically silicon valley  could cause damage or disruption to us  our employees  facilities  partners  suppliers  distributors and resellers  and customers  which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results 
we currently do not have redundant  multiple site capacity in the event of a natural disaster or catastrophic event 
in the event of such an occurrence  our business would suffer 
if we lose key personnel or are unable to hire additional qualified personnel as necessary  we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our goals our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our key management  engineering  sales and marketing  service and operations personnel  many of whom would be difficult to replace 
we do not have employment contracts with these individuals nor do we carry life insurance on any of our key personnel 
we believe our future success will also depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled managerial  engineering  sales and marketing  service  finance and operations personnel 
the market for these personnel is competitive  especially in the san francisco bay area  and we have had difficulty in hiring employees  particularly engineers  in the timeframe we desire 
in addition  retention has become more difficult for us and other public technology companies as a result of the stock market decline  which caused the price of many of our employees stock options to be above the current market price of our stock and we have recently experienced a high level of attrition  particularly in our sales personnel  including our senior vice president of worldwide sales and others 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in attracting and retaining our key personnel 
the loss of the services of any of our key personnel  the inability to attract or retain qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring desired personnel  particularly engineers and sales personnel  could make it difficult for us to manage our business and meet key objectives  such as new product introductions 
in addition  companies in the networking industry whose employees accept positions with competitors frequently claim that competitors have engaged in unfair hiring practices 
we have from time to time been involved in claims like this with other companies and  although to date they have not resulted in material litigation  we do not know whether we will be involved in additional claims in the future as we seek to hire and retain qualified personnel or that such claims will not result in material litigation 
we could incur substantial costs in litigating any such claims  regardless of the merits 

table of contents failure of our products to comply with evolving industry standards and complex government regulations may cause our products to not be widely accepted  which may prevent us from growing our net revenues or achieving profitability the market for network equipment products is characterized by the need to support industry standards as different standards emerge  evolve and achieve acceptance 
we will not be competitive unless we continually introduce new products and product enhancements that meet these emerging standards 
in the past  we have introduced new products that were not compatible with certain technological standards  and in the future we may not be able to effectively address the compatibility and interoperability issues that arise as a result of technological changes and evolving industry standards 
our products must comply with various united states federal government regulations and standards defined by agencies such as the federal communications commission  in addition to standards established by governmental authorities in various foreign countries and recommendations of the international telecommunication union 
if we do not comply with existing or evolving industry standards or if we fail to obtain timely domestic or foreign regulatory approvals or certificates we will not be able to sell our products where these standards or regulations apply  which may prevent us from sustaining our net revenue or achieving profitability 
failure to successfully expand our sales and support teams or educate them in regard to technologies and our product families may harm our operating results the sale of our products and services requires a concerted effort that is frequently targeted at several levels within a prospective customer s organization 
we may not be able to increase net revenues unless we expand our sales and support teams in order to address all of the customer requirements necessary to sell our products 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully integrate employees into our company or to educate current and future employees in regard to rapidly evolving technologies and our product families 
a failure to do so may hurt our revenue growth and operating results 
we may engage in future acquisitions that dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders  cause us to incur debt and assume contingent liabilities as part of our business strategy  we review acquisition and strategic investment prospects that we believe would complement our current product offerings  augment our market coverage or enhance our technical capabilities  or otherwise offer growth opportunities 
from time to time we review investments in new businesses and we expect to make investments in  and to acquire  businesses  products  or technologies in the future 
in the event of any future acquisitions  we could issue equity securities which would dilute current stockholders percentage ownership  incur substantial debt  assume contingent liabilities  or expend significant cash 
these actions could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or the price of our common stock 
moreover  even if we do obtain benefits in the form of increased sales and earnings  there may be a lag between the time when the expenses associated with an acquisition are incurred and the time when we recognize such benefits 
this is particularly relevant in cases where it is necessary to integrate new types of technology into our existing portfolio and new types of products may be targeted for potential customers with which we do not have pre existing relationships 
acquisitions and investment activities also entail numerous risks  including difficulties in the assimilation of acquired operations  technologies and or products  unanticipated costs associated with the acquisition or investment transaction  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  
table of contents adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers  risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience  the potential loss of key employees of acquired organizations  and substantial charges for the amortization of certain purchased intangible assets  deferred stock compensation or similar items 
we cannot ensure that we will be able to successfully integrate any businesses  products  technologies  or personnel that we might acquire in the future  and our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we may need additional capital to fund our future operations and  if it is not available when needed  we may need to reduce our planned development and marketing efforts  which may reduce our net revenues and prevent us from achieving profitability we believe that our existing working capital and cash available from credit facilities and future operations  will enable us to meet our working capital requirements for at least the next months 
however  if cash from future operations is insufficient  or if cash is used for acquisitions or other currently unanticipated uses  we may need additional capital 
the development and marketing of new products and the expansion of reseller and distribution channels and associated support personnel requires a significant commitment of resources 
in addition  if the markets for our products develop more slowly than anticipated  or if we fail to establish significant market share and achieve sufficient net revenues  we may continue to consume significant amounts of capital 
as a result  we could be required to raise additional capital 
to the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities  the issuance of such securities could result in dilution of the shares held by existing stockholders 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of debt securities  such securities may provide the holders certain rights  preferences  and privileges senior to those of common stockholders  and the terms of such debt could impose restrictions on our operations 
we cannot assure you that additional capital  if required  will be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
if we are unable to obtain sufficient amounts of additional capital  we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned product development and marketing efforts  which could harm our business  financial condition and operating results 
we have substantial debt obligations in connection with the sale of convertible subordinated notes in december  we incurred million of indebtedness 
we will require substantial amounts of cash to fund scheduled payments of interest on the convertible notes  payment of the principal amount of the convertible notes  future capital expenditures  payments on our leases and any increased working capital requirements 
if we are unable to meet our cash requirements out of cash flow from operations  there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain alternative financing 
the degree to which we are financially leveraged could materially and adversely affect our ability to obtain financing for working capital  acquisitions or other purposes and could make us more vulnerable to industry downturns and competitive pressures 
in the absence of such financing  our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions  to make future acquisitions  to absorb adverse operating results or to fund capital expenditures or increased working capital requirements would be significantly reduced 
our ability to meet our debt service obligations will be dependent upon our future performance  which will be subject to financial  business and other factors affecting our operations  some of which are beyond our control 
if we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to repay the notes at maturity  we could attempt to refinance the notes  however  no assurance can be given that such a refinancing would be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
any failure by us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the notes at maturity with respect to payments of principal or prior thereto with respect to payments of interest or required repurchases would constitute a default under the indenture and could cause a default under agreements governing our other indebtedness 

table of contents we have entered into long term lease agreements for several facilities that are currently vacant and may be difficult to sublease due to current real estate market conditions we have certain long term real estate lease commitments carrying future obligations for non cancelable lease payments 
reductions in our workforce and the restructuring of operations since fiscal have resulted in the need to consolidate certain of these leased facilities  located primarily in northern california  for which we recorded excess facilities charges of approximately million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal for more information  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we continue to attempt to sublease certain of these facilities and have estimated the amount of sublease income to offset the carrying costs of these facilities when establishing our excess facilities charges 
however  we may not be able to sublease these facilities at the times or on the terms we anticipated when we took the excess facilities charge and therefore if the market does not improve  we may incur additional charges in the future 
in addition  we may incur additional charges for excess facilities as a result of additional reductions in our workforce or future restructuring of operations 
we will continue to be responsible for all carrying costs of these facilities until such time as we can sublease these facilities or terminate the applicable leases based on the contractual terms of the lease agreements  and these costs may have an adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
our stock price has been volatile in the past and our stock price and the price of the notes may significantly fluctuate in the future in the past  our common stock price has fluctuated significantly 
this could continue as we or our competitors announce new products  our results or those of our customers or competition fluctuate  conditions in the networking or semiconductor industry change  or when investors  change their sentiment toward stocks in the networking technology sector 
in addition  fluctuations in our stock price and our price to earnings multiple may make our stock attractive to momentum  hedge or day trading investors who often shift funds into and out of stock rapidly  exacerbating price fluctuations in either direction  particularly when viewed on a quarterly basis 
securities we issue to fund our operations could dilute your ownership we may decide to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financing to fund our operations 
if we raise funds by issuing equity securities  the percentage ownership of current stockholders will be reduced and the new equity securities may have rights prior to those of our common stock  including the common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes 
we may not obtain sufficient financing on terms that are favorable to you or us 
we may delay  limit or eliminate some or all of our proposed operations if adequate funds are not available 
provisions in our charter documents and delaware law and our adoption of a stockholder rights plan may delay or prevent acquisition of us  which could decrease the value of our common stock and the notes our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors 
delaware law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of or more of our outstanding common stock 
in addition  our board of directors has the right to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval  which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer 
although we believe these provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law and our stockholder rights plan  which is described below  will provide for an opportunity to receive a higher bid by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors  these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some of our stockholders 

table of contents our board of directors adopted a stockholder rights plan  pursuant to which we declared and paid a dividend of one right for each share of common stock held by stockholders of record as of may  under the plan  each right will entitle stockholders to purchase a fractional share of our preferred stock for 
each such fractional share of the new preferred stock has terms designed to make it substantially the economic equivalent of one share of common stock 
initially the rights will not be exercisable and will trade with our common stock 
generally  the rights may become exercisable if a person or group acquires beneficial ownership of or more of our common stock or commences a tender or exchange offer upon consummation of which such person or group would beneficially own or more of our common stock 
when the rights become exercisable  our board of directors has the right to authorize the issuance of one share of our common stock in exchange for each right that is then exercisable 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximize the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we have invested in may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the principal amount of our investment will probably decline 
to minimize this risk  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  other non government debt securities and money market funds 
in general  money market funds are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 
the following table presents the amounts of our cash equivalents  short term investments  marketable securities and long term debt that are subject to market risk by range of expected maturity and weighted average interest rates as of june  and june  this table does not include money market funds because those funds are not subject to market risk 
maturing in three months or less three months to one year greater than one year total fair value in thousands june  included in cash and cash equivalents weighted average interest rate included in short term investments weighted average interest rate included in marketable securities weighted average interest rate long term debt weighted average interest rate maturing in three months or less three months to one year greater than one year total fair value in thousands june  included in cash and cash equivalents weighted average interest rate included in short term investments weighted average interest rate included in marketable securities weighted average interest rate long term debt weighted average interest rate exchange rate sensitivity currently  substantially all of our sales and the majority of our expenses are denominated in united states dollars and as a result  we have experienced no significant foreign exchange gains and losses to date 
while we have conducted some transactions in foreign currencies during the year ended june  and expect to continue to do so  we do not anticipate that foreign exchange gains or losses will be significant  in part because of our foreign exchange risk management process discussed below 

table of contents foreign exchange forward contracts we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge foreign currency forecasted transactions related to certain operating expenses  denominated in japanese yen  the euro  the swedish krona and the british pound 
these derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended and interpreted sfas 
at june   these forward foreign currency contracts had a notional principal amount of million fair value of 
these contracts have maturities of less than days 
additionally  we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate the effect of gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in japanese yen  the euro  the swedish krona and the british pound 
these derivatives are not designated as hedges under sfas at june   we held foreign currency forward contracts with a notional principal amount of million fair value of 
these contracts have maturities of less than days 
changes in the fair value of these foreign exchange forward contracts are offset largely by remeasurement of the underlying assets and liabilities 
we do not enter into foreign exchange forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses from operations  including the impact of hedging  were a loss of million in fiscal  a gain of million in fiscal and a loss of million in fiscal investments in equity securities we have historically made investments in several privately held companies 
these nonmarketable investments are accounted for under the cost method  as ownership is less than percent and we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating  financing and investing activities of the investee companies 
these investments are inherently risky as the market for the technologies or products they have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize 
it is possible that we could lose our entire initial investment in these companies 
as a part of management s process of regularly reviewing these investments for impairment  we recorded write downs of million and million on certain investments  which were determined to be other than temporarily impaired in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
at june   the carrying value of our remaining investments was zero
