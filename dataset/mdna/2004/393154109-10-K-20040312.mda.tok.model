item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md and a  in the annual report to shareholders annual report  and in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements notes  all included herein 
item business the company green mountain power corporation the company or gmp is a public utility operating company engaged in supplying electrical energy in the state of vermont state or vermont in a service territory with approximately one quarter of vermont s population 
we serve approximately  customers 
the company was incorporated under the laws of the state on april  our sources of revenue for the year ended december  were as follows percent from residential customers  percent from small commercial and industrial customers  percent from large commercial and industrial customers  percent from sales to other utilities  and percent from other sources 
see the annual report and md and a for further information about revenues 
during  our energy resources for retail and wholesale sales of electricity  excluding purchases made pursuant to the contract with morgan stanley capital group  inc the morgan stanley contract discussed under md and a power contract commitments  were obtained as follows percent from hydroelectric sources percent hydro quebec  percent company owned  and percent independent power producers  percent from a nuclear generating source the entergy nuclear vermont yankee  llc envy nuclear plant described below  percent from wood  percent from natural gas  percent from oil  and percent from wind 
the remaining percent was purchased on a short term basis from other utilities through the independent system operator of new england iso ne or iso new england  formerly the new england power pool nepool 
in  we estimate that we purchased or generated in excess of percent of our energy resources to satisfy our retail and wholesale sales of electricity under long term arrangements  including the morgan stanley contract 
remaining retail and wholesale sales were met through short term market purchases and represent volumetric differences between purchase commitments and our customers retail demand 
see note k of notes 
a major source of the company s power supply is our entitlement to a share of the power generated by the megawatt mw nuclear generating plant owned and operated by envy 
we have a percent equity interest in vermont yankee nuclear power corporation vermont yankee or vy  which has a long term power supply contract with envy that entitles us to percent of plant output through for further information concerning vermont yankee  see power resources vermont yankee 
the company participates in nepool  a regional bulk power transmission organization established to assure reliable and economical power supply in the northeast united states 
the iso ne was created to manage the operations of nepool  effective may  iso ne operates a market for all new england states for purchasers and sellers of electricity in the deregulated wholesale energy markets 
sellers place bids for the sale of their generation or purchased power resources and if demand is high enough the output from those resources is sold 
we must purchase additional electricity to meet customer demand during periods of high usage  to replace energy repurchased by hydro quebec under an arrangement negotiated in and to replace power not delivered under our contracts and entitlements due to outages  curtailments or other events that result in reduced deliveries 
our costs to serve demand during such high usage periods such as warmer than normal temperatures in summer months and to replace such energy repurchases by hydro quebec rose substantially after the market opened to competitive bidding on may  our principal service territory is an area roughly miles in width extending miles across north central vermont between lake champlain on the west and the connecticut river on the east 
included in this territory are the cities and towns of montpelier  barre  south burlington  vergennes  williston  shelburne  and winooski  as well as the village of essex junction and a number of smaller communities 
we also distribute electricity in four separate areas located in southern and southeastern vermont that are interconnected with our principal service area through the transmission lines of vermont electric power company  inc velco and others 
included in these areas are the communities of vernon where the envy nuclear plant is located  bellows falls  white river junction  wilder  wilmington and dover 
the company s right to distribute electrical service in its service territory is the utility s most important asset 
we supply at wholesale a portion of the power requirements of several municipalities and cooperatives in vermont 
we are obligated to meet the changing electrical requirements of these wholesale customers  in contrast to our obligation to other wholesale customers  which is limited to specified amounts of capacity and energy established by contract 
major business activities in our service areas include computer assembly and components manufacturing and other electronics manufacturing  software development  granite fabrication  service enterprises such as government  insurance  regional retail shopping  tourism particularly fall and winter recreation  and dairy and general farming

state and federal regulation general 
the company is subject to the regulatory authority of the vermont public service board vpsb  or the board  which extends to retail rates  services and facilities  securities issues and various other matters 
the separate vermont department of public service the department  or the dps  created by statute in  is responsible for development of energy supply plans for the state of vermont  purchases of power as an agent for the state and other general regulatory matters 
the vpsb principally conducts quasi judicial proceedings  such as rate setting 
the department  through a director for public advocacy  is entitled to participate as the public advocate in such proceedings and regularly does so 
political or social organizations that represent certain classes of customers  neighbors of our properties  or other persons or entities may petition the vpsb to be granted intervener status in such proceedings 
our rate tariffs are uniform throughout our service area 
we have entered into a number of jobs incentive agreements  providing for reduced capacity charges to large customers applicable only to new load 
we have an economic development agreement with international business machines corporation ibm that provides for contractually established charges  rather than tariff rates  for certain loads 
all such agreements must be approved by the vpsb 
see item md and a results of operations operating revenues and mwh sales 
our wholesale rate on sales to two wholesale customers is regulated by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc 
revenues from sales to these customers were less than percent of our operating revenues for we provide transmission service to twelve customers within the state under rates regulated by the ferc  revenues for such services amounted to less than percent of our operating revenues for on july   the ferc approved our open access transmission tariff  and on august  we filed our compliance report 
in accordance with ferc order  we have functionally separated our transmission operations and filed with the ferc a code of conduct for our transmission operations 
we have not experienced any material adverse effects or loss of wholesale customers due to ferc order our open access tariff could reduce the amount of capacity available to the company from such facilities in the future 
see item md and a transmission expenses 
the company has equity interests in vermont yankee  velco and vermont electric transmission company  inc vetco  a wholly owned subsidiary of velco 
we have filed an exemption statement under section a of the public utility holding company act of  thereby securing exemption from the provisions of such act  except for section a  which prohibits the acquisition of securities of certain other utility companies without approval of the sec 
the sec has the power to institute proceedings to terminate such exemption for cause 
licensing 
pursuant to the federal power act  the ferc has granted licenses for the following hydroelectric projects we own issue date licensed period project site bolton

the re licensing application for waterbury was filed in august the waterbury reservoir was drained in to prepare for repairs to the dam by the state  presently estimated for completion in late when repairs are complete  we expect the project to be re licensed for a year term 
we do not have any competition for the waterbury license 
department of public service twenty year electric plan 
in december  the department adopted an update of its twenty year electrical power supply plan the plan for the state 
the plan includes an overview of statewide growth and development as they relate to future requirements for electrical energy  an assessment of available energy resources  and estimates of future electrical energy demand 
in august   we filed with the vpsb and the department an integrated resource plan pursuant to vermont statute vsa c 
that filing is pending before the vpsb 
recent rate developments the vpsb issued an order on december  approving the company s rate plan the rate plan  jointly proposed by the company and the department 
principal terms of the rate plan include allows the company to raise rates percent  effective january   and percent effective january   if the increases are supported by cost of service schedules submitted days prior to the effective dates 
allows the company the opportunity to file for rate increases during the period from january  to january  if the company experiences extraordinary events  such as repair costs due to an ice storm or other natural disaster 
reduces the company s allowed return on equity from percent to percent for the period beginning january  to january  approves a three year economic development agreement for ibm  as long as ibm does not reduce employment by more than five percent during the period 
provides for recovery of various regulatory assets  including the remediation of the pine street environmental superfund site in burlington  vt 
single customer dependence the company had one major retail customer  ibm  metered at two locations that accounted for percent  percent and percent of the company s retail operating revenues in  and  respectively 
no other retail customer accounted for more than percent of our revenue during the past three years 
ibm has reduced its vermont workforce by approximately  since  to a level of approximately  employees 
if future significant losses in electricity sales to ibm were to occur  the company s earnings could be impacted adversely 
if earnings were materially reduced as a result of lower retail sales  we would seek a retail rate increase from the vpsb 
the company is not aware of any plans by ibm to further reduce production at its vermont facility 
we currently estimate  based on a number of projected variables  the retail rate increase required from all retail customers that would result from a hypothetical shutdown of the ibm facility to be in the range of five to eight percent  inclusive of projected declines in sales to other residential and commercial customers 
see item md and a results of operations  operating revenues and mwh  and note a of notes 
competition and restructuring electric utilities historically have had exclusive franchises for the retail sale of electricity in specified service territories 
legislative authority has existed since that would permit vermont cities  towns and villages to own and operate public utilities 
since that time  no municipality served by the company has established a municipal public utility 
in march  voters in the town of rockingham  vermont rockingham approved an article authorizing rockingham to create a municipal utility and to acquire the electric distribution systems of the company and or central vermont public service corporation located within the rockingham 
in november  rockingham notified the company that the town intended to initiate proceedings before the town selectboard to condemn the company s distribution and associated property located within the town 
the company sought and obtained in december a preliminary injunction from the state superior court prohibiting the town from proceeding with condemnation before the selectboard 
the company successfully argued that vermont law required rockingham to pursue any such municipalization effort by petition to the vpsb  which is required to determine both the fair value of any assets subject to municipalization and the amount of damages to the utility caused by severance of the property subject to municipalization 
the preliminary injunction remains in effect and rockingham has not filed any petition with the vpsb seeking to municipalize assets 
the company receives annual revenues of approximately million from its customers in rockingham 
should rockingham create a municipal system  the company would vigorously pursue its right to receive just compensation from rockingham 
such compensation would include full reimbursement for company assets  if acquired  and full reimbursement of any other costs associated with the loss of customers in rockingham  to assure that neither our remaining customers nor our shareholders effectively subsidize a rockingham municipal utility 
in  the vermont general assembly enacted legislation that authorized the department to sell electricity on a significantly expanded basis 
under the law  the department can sell electricity purchased from any source at retail to all customer classes throughout the state  but only if it convinces the vpsb and other state officials that the public good will be served by such sales 
since  the department has made limited additional retail sales of electricity 
the department retains its traditional responsibilities of public advocacy before the vpsb and electricity planning on a statewide basis 
in certain states across the country  including other new england states  legislation has been enacted to allow retail customers to choose their electricity suppliers  with incumbent utilities required to deliver that electricity over their transmission and distribution systems 
increased competitive pressure in the electric utility industry could potentially restrict the company s ability to charge energy prices sufficient to recover embedded costs  such as the cost of purchased power obligations or of generation facilities owned by the company 
the amount by which such costs might exceed market prices is commonly referred to as stranded costs 
there are currently no regulatory proceedings  court actions or pending legislative proposals to adopt electric industry restructuring in vermont 
legislation has been introduced in the vermont legislature that would permit but not require the company to negotiate with individual customers to permit such customers to procure their own electric power supply requirements  subject to vpsb approval 
we cannot predict whether this legislation will be enacted 
if enacted  the company would not negotiate any such arrangement unless  in our estimation  the arrangement assured the company of full recovery of any resulting stranded costs and that the company s financial condition would not otherwise be adversely affected 
regulatory and legislative authorities at the federal level and in some states  including vermont where legislation has not been enacted  are considering how to facilitate competition for electricity sales 
for further information regarding competition and restructuring  see item md and a regulatory risk and other risk 
construction and capital requirements our capital expenditures for through and projected for are set forth in item md and a liquidity and capital resources construction 
construction projections are subject to continuing review and may be revised from time to time in accordance with changes in the company s financial condition  load forecasts  the availability and cost of labor and materials  licensing and other regulatory requirements  changing environmental standards and other relevant factors 
see item md and a liquidity and capital resources 
power resources on february   the company entered into a contract with morgan stanley capital group  inc morgan stanley 
in august  the morgan stanley contract was modified and extended to december  the contract provides us a means of managing price risks associated with changing fossil fuel prices 
for additional information on the morgan stanley contract  see note k of notes

  vermont yankee 
on july   vermont yankee completed the sale of its nuclear power plant to envy 
in addition to the sale of the generating plant  the transaction calls for envy  through its power contract with vy  to provide percent of the plant output to the company through  which represents approximately percent of our projected energy requirements 
prices under the power purchase agreement between vy and envy the ppa range from to per megawatt hour for the period beginning january the ppa calls for a downward adjustment in the price if market prices for electricity fall by defined amounts beginning no later than november if market prices rise  however  contract prices are not adjusted upward 
the company remains responsible for procuring replacement energy at market prices during periods of scheduled or unscheduled outages at the envy plant 
prior to the sale of the vy plant to envy  the plant had fuel rods that required repair during may  a maintenance requirement that is not unique to vy 
vy closed the plant for a twelve day period  beginning on may   to repair the rods 
our cost for the repair  including incremental replacement energy costs  was approximately million 
the company received an accounting order from the vpsb on august   allowing it to defer the additional costs related to the outage 
the company expects to amortize recover these costs beginning in under the company s rate plan 
the company received a credit of approximately  from vy and has requested permission from the vpsb to apply this credit to reduce the million regulatory asset 
our ownership share of vy has increased from approximately percent last year to approximately percent currently  due to vy s purchase of certain minority shareholders interests 
vy s primary role consists of administering its power supply contract with envy and its contracts with vy s present sponsors 
our entitlement to energy produced by the envy nuclear plant has remained at percent of plant production 
under our capital funds agreement with vy  we are required  subject to obtaining necessary regulatory approvals  to provide of the capital requirements of vermont yankee not obtained from outside sources 
during periods when envy power is unavailable  the costs of replacement power occasionally exceed those costs that we would have incurred for envy power purchased from vermont yankee 
replacement power is available to us from the iso ne and through contractual arrangements with other utilities 
replacement power costs can adversely affect cash flow  and  unless deferred and or recovered in rates  such costs could adversely affect reported earnings 
in the case of unscheduled outages of significant duration resulting in substantial unanticipated costs for replacement power  the vpsb generally has authorized deferral and recovery of such costs 
the envy nuclear plant s current operating license expires march during the year ended december   we used  mwh of vermont yankee energy supplied by envy representing percent of the net electricity generated and purchased net power supply by the company 
the average cost of vermont yankee electricity in was per kwh

hydro quebec highgate interconnection 
on september   the highgate transmission facilities  which were constructed to import energy from hydro quebec in canada  began commercial operation 
the transmission facilities at highgate include a mw ac to dc to ac converter terminal and seven miles of kv transmission line 
velco built and operates the converter facilities  which we own jointly with a number of other vermont utilities 
nepool hydro quebec interconnection 
velco and certain other nepool members have entered into agreements with hydro quebec  which provided for the construction in two phases of a direct interconnection between the electric systems in new england and the electric system of hydro quebec in canada 
the vermont participants in this project  which has a capacity of  mw  will derive approximately percent of the total power supply benefits associated with the nepool hydro quebec interconnection 
the company  in turn  receives approximately one third of the vermont share of those benefits 
the benefits of the interconnection include access to surplus hydroelectric energy from hydro quebec  and a provision for emergency transfers and mutual backup to improve reliability for both the hydro quebec system and the new england systems 
phase i 
the first phase phase i of the nepool hydro quebec interconnection consists of transmission facilities having a capacity of mw that originate at the des cantons substation on the hydro quebec system near sherbrooke  canada and traverse a portion of eastern vermont and extend to a converter terminal located in comerford  new hampshire 
vetco was formed to construct and operate the portion of phase i within the united states 
under the phase i contracts  each new england participant  including the company  is required to pay monthly its proportionate share of vetco s total cost of service  including its capital costs 
each participant also pays a proportionate share of the total costs of service associated with those portions of the transmission facilities constructed in new hampshire by a subsidiary of new england electric system 
phase ii 
phase ii expanded the phase i facilities from mw to  mw  and provides for transmission of hydro quebec power from the phase i terminal in northern new hampshire to sandy pond  massachusetts 
the participants in this project  including the company  have contracted to pay monthly their proportionate share of the total cost of constructing  owning and operating the phase ii facilities  including capital costs 
as a supporting participant  the company must make support payments under year agreements 
these support agreements meet the capital lease accounting requirements under sfas at december   the present value of the company s obligation was approximately  the company s projected future minimum payments under the phase ii support agreements are approximately  for each of the years and an aggregate of  for the years the phase ii portion of the project is owned by new england hydro transmission electric company  inc and new england hydro transmission corporation  subsidiaries of new england electric system  in which certain of the phase ii participating utilities  including the company  own equity interests in such companies 
the company owns approximately percent of the equity of the corporations owning the phase ii facilities 
during construction of the phase ii project  the company  as an equity sponsor  was required to provide equity capital 
at december   the capital structure of such corporations was approximately percent common equity and percent long term debt 
see note b and note j of notes 
hydro quebec hydro quebec power supply contracts 
we have several power purchase contracts with hydro quebec 
the bulk of our purchases are comprised of two schedules  b and c  pursuant to a firm contract dated december the vjo contract 
under these two schedules  we purchase mw from hydro quebec 
in november  we entered into an arrangement the arrangement with hydro quebec under which hydro quebec paid  to the company in exchange for certain power purchase options 
see item md and a power supply expenses  power contract commitments and note k of notes 
during  we used  mwh under schedule b  and  mwh under schedule c of the vjo contract  representing percent of our net power supply 
the average cost of hydro quebec electricity in was approximately per kwh 
nepool and short term opportunity purchases and sales 
we have arrangements with numerous utilities and power marketers actively trading power in new england and new york under which we purchase or sell power on short notice and generally for brief periods of time when required to balance electricity supply with demand 
opportunity purchases are also arranged when it is possible to purchase power for less than it would cost us to generate the power with our own sources 
purchases may also help us save on replacement power costs during an outage of one of our base load sources 
opportunity sale prices are generally set so as to recover all of the forecasted fuel or production costs and to recover some  if not all  associated capacity costs 
during  the company purchased  mwh representing percent of the company s net power supply at an average cost of per kwh 
during  the ferc accepted iso ne s request to implement a smd governing wholesale energy sales in new england 
iso ne implemented its smd plan on march  smd includes a system of locational marginal pricing of energy  under which prices are determined by zone  and based in part on transmission congestion experienced in each zone 
currently  the state of vermont constitutes a single zone under the plan  although pricing may eventually be determined on a more localized nodal basis 
iso ne and nepool have committed to facilitation of a stakeholder process to examine alternative pricing options  including alternatives to nodal pricing  and to file their report with ferc in july we believe that nodal pricing could result in a material adverse impact on our power supply or transmission costs  if adopted 
stony brook i 
the massachusetts municipal wholesale electric company mmwec is principal owner and operator of stony brook  a mw combined cycle intermediate generating station located in ludlow  massachusetts  which commenced commercial operation in november in october  we entered into a joint ownership agreement with mmwec  whereby we acquired an percent ownership share of the plant  entitling us to mw of capacity 
in addition to this entitlement  we have contracted for mw of capacity for the life of the stony brook i plant  for which we will pay a proportionate share of mmwec s share of the plant s fixed costs and variable operating expenses 
the three units that comprise stony brook i are all capable of burning oil 
two of the units are also capable of burning natural gas 
the natural gas system at the plant was modified in to allow two units to operate simultaneously on natural gas 
during  we used  mwh from this plant representing percent of our net power supply at an average cost of per kwh 
see notes i and k of notes 
wyman unit the w 
f 
wyman unit  which is located in yarmouth  maine  is an oil fired steam plant with a capacity of mw 
central maine power company sponsored the construction of this plant 
we have a joint ownership share of percent mw in the wyman unit  which began commercial operation in december during  we used  mwh from this unit representing percent of our net power supply at an average cost of per kwh  based only on operation  maintenance  and fuel costs incurred during see note i of notes 
mcneil station 
the jc mcneil station the mcneil plant  which is located in burlington  vermont  is a wood chip and gas fired steam plant with a capacity of mw 
we have an percent or mw interest in the mcneil plant  which began operation in june in  the plant added the capability to burn natural gas on an as available interruptible service basis 
during  we used  mwh from this unit representing percent of our net power supply at an average cost of per kwh  based only on operation  maintenance  and fuel costs incurred during see note i of notes 
independent power producers 
the vpsb has adopted rules that implement for vermont the purchase requirements established by federal law in the public utility regulatory policies act of purpa 
under the rules  qualifying facilities have the option to sell their output to a central state appointed purchasing agent under a variety of long term and short term  firm and non firm pricing schedules 
each of these schedules is based upon the projected vermont composite system s power costs that would be required but for the purchases from independent producers 
the state s purchasing agent assigns the energy so purchased  and the costs of purchase  to each vermont retail electric utility based upon its pro rata share of total vermont retail energy sales 
utilities may also contract directly with producers 
the rules provide that all reasonable costs incurred by a utility under the rules will be included in the utilities revenue requirements for ratemaking purposes 
currently  the state purchasing agent  vermont electric power producers  inc veppi  is authorized to seek mw of power from qualifying facilities under purpa  of which our average pro rata share in was approximately percent or mw 
the rated capacity of the qualifying facilities currently selling power to veppi is approximately mw 
these facilities were all online by the spring of  and no other projects are under development 
we do not expect any new projects to come online in the foreseeable future because excess capacity in the region has eliminated the need for  and value of  additional qualifying facilities 
in  through our direct contracts and veppi  we purchased  mwh of qualifying facilities production representing percent of our net power supply at an average cost of per kwh 
company hydroelectric power 
we wholly own and operate eight hydroelectric generating facilities located on river systems within our service area  the largest of which has a generating output of mw 
in  company owned hydroelectric plants produced  mwh  representing percent of our net power supply at an average cost of per kwh based on operating and maintenance expenses  excluding depreciation expense and amortization of licensing costs 
see state and federal regulation licensing 
velco 
the company and six other vermont electric distribution utilities own velco 
since commencing operation in  velco has transmitted power for its owners in vermont  including power from the new york power authority and other power contracted for by vermont utilities 
velco also purchases bulk power for resale at cost to its owners  and as a member of nepool  represents all vermont electric utilities in pool arrangements and transactions 
see note b of notes 
fuel 
during  our retail and requirements wholesale sales were provided by the following fuel sources percent from hydroelectric sources percent hydro quebec  percent company owned  and percent independent power producers  percent from a nuclear generating source the envy nuclear plant  percent from wood  percent from natural gas  percent from oil  percent from wind  and percent purchased on a short term basis from other utilities through the iso 
we do not maintain long term contracts for the supply of oil for our wholly owned oil fired peak generating stations mw 
we did not experience difficulty in obtaining oil for our own units during none of the utilities from which we expect to purchase oil or gas fired capacity in has advised us of grounds for doubt about maintenance of secure sources of oil and gas during the year 
wood for the mcneil plant is furnished to the burlington electric department from a variety of sources under short term contracts ranging from several weeks to six months duration 
the mcneil plant used  tons of wood chips and mill residue   gallons of fuel oil  and million cubic feet of natural gas in the mcneil plant  assuming any needed regulatory approvals are obtained  is forecasting consumption of wood chips to be  tons  fuel oil of  gallons and natural gas consumption of million cubic feet 
the stony brook combined cycle generating station is capable of burning either natural gas or oil in two of its turbines 
natural gas is supplied to the plant subject to its availability 
during periods of extremely cold weather  the supplier reserves the right to discontinue deliveries to the plant in order to satisfy the demand of its residential customers 
we assume  for planning and budgeting purposes  that the plant will be supplied with gas during the months of april through november  and that it will run solely on oil during the months of december through march 
the plant maintains an oil supply sufficient to meet approximately one half of its annual needs 
wind project 
the company was selected by the department of energy doe and the electric power research institute epri to build a commercial scale wind powered facility 
the doe and epri provided partial funding for the wind project of approximately million 
the net expenditures to the company of the project  located in the southern vermont town of searsburg  was million 
the eleven wind turbines have a rating of mw and were commissioned july  in  the project produced  mwh  representing percent of the company s net power supply at an approximate average cost of per kwh  based only on maintenance costs 
segment information financial information about the company s primary industry segment  the electric utility  is presented in item  selected financial data  and in the annual report and notes included herein 
the company has sold or disposed of substantially all of the operations and assets of northern water resources  inc nwr  formerly known as mountain energy  inc  classified as discontinued operations in industry segment information relating to the company s discontinued operations is presented in note l of notes 
seasonal nature of business winter recreational activities  longer hours of darkness and heating loads from cold weather historically caused our average peak electric sales to occur in december  january or february 
summer air conditioning loads have increased in recent years as a result of steady economic growth in our service territory 
as a result  our heaviest load  mw  occurred on august  under nepool market rules implemented in may  the cost basis that had supported the company s previous seasonally differentiated rate design was eliminated  making a seasonal rate structure no longer appropriate 
the elimination of the seasonal rate structure in all classes of service effective april was approved by the vpsb in january employees as of december   the company had employees  exclusive of temporary employees 
the company considers its relations with employees to be excellent 
energy efficiency in  gmp did not offer its own energy efficiency programs 
energy efficiency services were provided to gmp s customers by a statewide energy efficiency utility eeu known as efficiency vermont  created by the vpsb in the eeu is funded by a separate energy efficiency charge that appears as a line item on each customer bill 
a charge per kw and per kwh is applied 
the purpose of these charges is to apply equal efficiency charges across vermont to customers with similar usage  regardless of their local utility rates 
the charge represents two to three percent of each customer s total electric bill 
the funds we collect are remitted to a fiscal agent representing the state of vermont 
rate design the company seeks to design rates to encourage efficient electrical use 
since  we have offered optional time of use rates for residential and commercial customers 
currently  approximately  of the company s residential customers continue to be billed on the original time of use rate basis 
in  the company received regulatory approval for a rate design that permitted it to charge prices for electric service that reflected as accurately as possible the cost burden imposed by each customer class 
the company s rate design objectives are to provide a stable pricing structure and to accurately reflect the cost of providing electric services 
this rate structure helps to achieve these goals 
since inefficient use of electricity increases its cost  customers who are charged prices that reflect the cost of providing electrical service have real incentives to follow the most efficient usage patterns 
included in the vpsb s order approving this rate design was a requirement that the company s largest customers be charged time of use rates 
at december   approximately  of the company s largest customers  comprising approximately percent of retail revenues  received service on mandatory time of use rates 
as a result of the vpsb approval of the rate plan  the company will file with the vpsb a new fully allocated cost of service study and rate re design  which will allocate the company s revenue requirement among all customer classes on the basis of current costs 
the new rate design will be subject to vpsb approval and is not expected to adversely affect operating results 
dispatchable and interruptible service contracts in  we had dispatchable power contracts contracts were year round  while the seasonal contracts included two major ski areas 
the dispatchable portion of the contracts allows customers to purchase electricity during times designated by the company when low cost power is available 
the customer s demand during these periods is not considered in calculating the monthly billing 
this program enables the company and the customers to benefit from load control

     item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
executive overview green mountain power corporation the company generates virtually all of its earnings from retail electricity sales 
our retail electricity sales grow at an average annual rate of between one and two percent  about average for most electric utility companies in new england 
while wholesale revenues are significant  they have relatively minor impact on our operating results and financial condition 
the company is regulated and cannot adjust prices of retail electricity sales without regulatory approval from the vermont public service board vpsb 
the company increased its dividend in february from an annual rate of per share to per share 
the company s dividend payout ratio remains comparatively low  at less than percent of earnings 
we expect to grow our dividend payout ratio to between and percent over the next five years  in line with other electric utilities having similar risk profiles  so long as financial and operating results permit 
fair regulatory treatment is fundamental to maintaining the company s financial stability 
rates must be set at levels to recover costs  including a market rate of return to equity and debt holders 
in december  the company received approval from the vpsb of a new rate plan covering the period through  which sets rates at levels the company believes will provide an improved opportunity to recover our costs  and to earn our allowed rate of return 
power supply expenses are equivalent to approximately percent of total revenues 
the company s need to seek rate increases from its customers frequently moves in tandem with increases in our power supply costs 
we have entered into long term power supply contracts for most of our energy needs 
all of our power supply contract costs are currently being recognized in the rates we charge our customers 
the risks associated with our power supply resources  including outage  curtailment  and other delivery risks  the timing of contract expirations  the volatility of wholesale prices  and other factors impacting our power supply resources and how they relate to customer demand are discussed below under item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk  and other risk factors 
we also discuss other risks  including load risk related to our largest customer  international business machines corporation ibm  and contingencies that could have a significant impact on future operating results and our financial condition 
growth opportunities beyond the company s normal investment in its infrastructure are also discussed  and include a planned increase in our equity investment in vermont electric power company  inc velco and a planned increase in sales of utility services 
in this section  we explain the general financial condition and the results of operations for the company and its subsidiaries 
this explanation includes factors that affect our business  our earnings and costs in the periods presented and why they changed between periods  the source of our earnings  our expenditures for capital projects and what we expect they will be in the future  where we expect to get cash for future capital expenditures  and how all of the above affect our overall financial condition 
our critical accounting policies are discussed below under item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  and other factors  under liquidity and capital resources pension  in note a  significant accounting policies  and in note h  pension and retirement plans 
management believes the most critical accounting policies include the timing of expense and revenue recognition under the regulatory accounting framework within which we operate  the manner in which we account for certain power supply arrangements that qualify as derivatives  the assumptions that we make regarding defined benefit plans  and revenue recognition  particularly as it relates to unbilled and deferred revenues 
these accounting policies  among others  affect the company s significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
there are statements in this section that contain projections or estimates that are considered to be forward looking as defined by the securities and exchange commission the sec 
in these statements  you may find words such as believes  expects  plans  or similar words 
these statements are not guarantees of our future performance 
there are risks  uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to be different from those projected 
some of the reasons the results may be different include regulatory and judicial decisions or legislation changes in regional market and transmission rules energy supply and demand and pricing contractual commitments availability  terms  and use of capital general economic and business environment changes in technology nuclear and environmental issues industry restructuring and cost recovery including stranded costs weather we address these items in more detail below 
these forward looking statements represent our estimates and assumptions only as of the date of this report 
earnings summary years ended consolidated earnings per share of common stock consolidated return on average common equity 

the company reported consolidated earnings of per share of common stock  diluted  in compared to consolidated earnings of per share  diluted  in the improvement in earnings per share reflected reduced power supply expenses to serve retail sales  an increase in sales to residential customers and a reduction in the number of common stock shares outstanding 
these favorable developments more than offset increased administrative and general costs  a reduction in the company s allowed rate of return  increased interest expense in  and a decrease in the recognition of deferred revenues  compared with our financial health improved during and as a result  we were able to reduce significantly our cost of capital in the fourth quarter of by issuing new long term debt and using a portion of the proceeds to acquire approximately  shares of our common stock 
our earnings per share improved by approximately per share as a result of the stock buyback 
in december  the vpsb approved a rate plan for the period through the rate plan  jointly proposed by the company and the vermont department of public service the department or the dps 
the rate plan provides the company with a stable  predictable rate path through  a plan for full recovery of the company s principal regulatory assets  and an improved opportunity for the company to earn its allowed rate of return through the rate plan calls for no retail rate increases in or  then scheduled increases of percent effective january   and percent effective january  the rate plan sets the company s allowed return on equity from core utility operations at percent  effective with  and provides for an earnings cap at that level through the rate plan is summarized in more detail below under rates 
the vpsb s january rate order the settlement order allowed the company to defer revenues of approximately million  generated by leveling winter summer rates during  to help offset costs and realize our allowed rate of return during the period 
we recognized approximately million of these deferred revenues to achieve our allowed rate of return during  compared with approximately million recognized in the vpsb has permitted the company to carry over unused deferred revenues totaling approximately million to as part of the rate plan 
the improvement in earnings from continuing operations in  compared with  resulted primarily from lower capital costs and other operating expenses  including million reduction in interest expense  reflecting lower interest rates and average debt levels  million reduction in preferred stock dividends  reflecting the company s redemption of outstanding preferred stock  and recognition of million in revenue deferred from under the settlement order 
these favorable results were partially offset by increased maintenance expense  transmission expense and power supply expense to serve retail customers  compared to item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  and other risk factors 
we consider our principal risks to include power supply risks  our regulatory environment particularly as it relates to the company s periodic need for rate relief  risks associated with our principal customer  ibm  pension and postretirement healthcare costs and weather 
discussion of these and other risks  as well as factors contributing to mitigation of these risks  follows 
power supply risk 
the company s most significant power supply contracts are the hydro quebec vermont joint owners vjo contract the vjo contract and the vermont yankee nuclear power corporation vy or vermont yankee contract the vermont yankee contract which are summarized in the following table 
contract mwh mwh mwh mwh expires vjo contract 





  vermont yankee contract   all of the company s power supply contract costs are currently being recovered through rates approved by the vpsb 
we expect approximately percent of our estimated customer demand load requirements through to be met by these contracts and by our generation and other power supply resources 
these contracts and resources significantly reduce the company s exposure to volatility in wholesale energy market prices 
the company s power supply contracts are described in more detail below under the heading power contract commitments 
a primary factor affecting future operating results is the volatility of the wholesale electricity market 
implementation of new england s wholesale market for electricity has increased volatility of wholesale power prices 
periods frequently occur when weather  availability of power supply resources and other factors cause significant differences between customer demand and electricity supply 
because electricity cannot be stored  in these situations the company must buy or sell the difference into a marketplace that has experienced volatile energy prices 
volatility and market price trends also make it more difficult to extend or enter into new power supply contracts at prices that avoid the need for rate relief 
during  we estimate that the company paid an additional million for replacement power as the result of an unscheduled outage at the vermont yankee nuclear power plant 
while the vermont yankee plant has had an excellent operating record  future unscheduled outages could occur at times when replacement energy costs are above vermont yankee contract costs 
we sometimes experience energy delivery deficiencies under the vjo contract as a result of outages or other problems with the transmission interconnection facilities over which we schedule deliveries 
when such deficiencies occur  we purchase replacement energy on the wholesale market  usually at prices that are higher than vjo contract costs 
under the vjo contract  hydro quebec has the right to reduce the load factor from percent to percent a total three times over the life of the contract 
hydro quebec exercised the first of these load reduction options  effective for the year the net cost of hydro quebec s exercise of this option increased power supply expense during by approximately million 
during  hydro quebec exercised its second option to reduce the load factor for  which we estimate will increase power supply expense by approximately million 
we expect hydro quebec to exercise its third option in for deliveries occurring principally during  at an estimated cost of million to million  based on current wholesale market prices for hydro quebec also retains the right under the vjo contract to curtail annual energy deliveries by percent up to five times  over the to period  if documented drought conditions exist in quebec 
hydro quebec has not exercised this right and has not communicated to the company any present intention to do so 
under the vjo contract  the vjo  including the company  have two options to adjust deliveries by a five percent load factor 
these options cannot be used to offset hydro quebec s reductions through  but may be used after to manage power supply costs 
the company has established a risk management program designed to stabilize cash flow and earnings by minimizing power supply risks 
transactions permitted by the risk management program include futures  forward contracts  option contracts  swaps and transmission congestion rights 
these transactions are used to hedge the risk of fossil fuel and spot market electricity price increases 
some of these transactions present the risk of potential losses from adverse changes in commodity prices 
our risk management policy specifies risk measures  the amount of tolerable risk exposure  and authorization limits for transactions 
our principal power supply contract counter parties and generators  hydro quebec  entergy nuclear vermont yankee  llc envy and morgan stanley capital group  inc morgan stanley  all currently have investment grade credit ratings 
the company has a contract with morgan stanley the morgan stanley contract that is used to hedge our power supply costs against increases in fossil fuel prices 
morgan stanley purchases the majority of the company s power supply resources at index prices for fossil fuel resources and specified prices for contracted resources and then sells power to the company at a fixed rate to serve pre established load requirements 
this contract  along with other power supply commitments  allows us to fix the cost of most of our power supply requirements  subject to power resource availability and other risks 
the morgan stanley contract is described in more detail below under the heading power contract commitments 
the morgan stanley contract is a derivative under statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas and is effective through december  management has estimated the fair value of the future net benefit of this arrangement at december   is approximately million 
we currently have an arrangement that grants hydro quebec an option the arrangement to call power at prices that are expected to be below estimated future market rates 
the arrangement is described in more detail below under the heading power supply expenses 
this arrangement is a derivative and is effective through management s estimate of the fair value of the future net cost for this arrangement at december   is approximately million 
we sometimes use forward contracts to hedge forecasted calls by hydro quebec under the arrangement 
the table below presents assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the morgan stanley contract and the arrangement 
the forward prices for electricity used in this analysis are consistent with the company s current long term wholesale energy price forecast

black scholes the table below presents the company s market risk of the morgan stanley and hydro quebec derivatives  estimated as the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical ten percent adverse change in wholesale energy prices  which nets to approximately million 
actual results may differ materially from the table illustration

  regulatory risk management believes that fair regulatory treatment is crucial to maintaining its financial stability  including its ability to attract capital 
vermont is the only state in the new england region that has not adopted some form of electric industry restructuring 
the company  like all other electric utilities in vermont  accordingly operates as a vertically integrated electric utility  with the obligation to serve all customers in our service territory with electrical transmission  distribution and energy supplies sufficient to satisfy customer load requirements 
vermont does not have a fuel or purchased power adjustment clause that would allow increases in power supply costs to be recovered immediately in the rates we charge customers 
historically  however  the vpsb has allowed electric utilities to defer material unexpected increases in power supply costs to future periods to permit recovery in future rates 
vermont law also allows electric utilities to seek temporary rate increases if deemed necessary by the vpsb to provide adequate and efficient service or to preserve the viability of the utility 
electric utility rates in vermont are set based on the utility s cost of service 
as a result  vermont electric utilities are subject to certain accounting standards that apply only to regulated businesses 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  allows regulated entities  including the company  in appropriate circumstances  to establish regulatory assets and liabilities  and thereby defer the income statement impact of certain costs and revenues that are expected to be realized in future rates 
regulatory assets represent incurred costs that have been deferred because the company has concluded that they are probable of future recovery in customer rates 
regulatory liabilities generally represent obligations to make refunds to customers for previous collections of costs 
the company filed its last retail rate case during since that time we have deferred a material amount of expenditures as regulatory assets 
these regulatory assets have been judged as probable of recovery by management 
as of december   the most significant regulatory assets not being recovered in current rates are the following regulatory assets at december  in thousands pine street barge canal 

  demand side management 


  unscheduled vy outage costs   total 










  the rate plan  approved by the vpsb in december  provides for amortization and recovery of all of the regulatory assets listed above  beginning january  the pine street barge canal regulatory asset will be amortized over a period of years without a return on the remaining balance of the asset 
the remaining assets will be amortized over a five year period 
both the demand side management and the unscheduled vy outage costs accrue a return defined by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc based on the capital structure of the utility afudc rate 
the afudc rate for for the company was approximately percent 
the company currently complies with the provisions of sfas if we had determined that the company no longer met the criteria for following sfas  at december   the accounting impact would have been an extraordinary non cash charge to operations of million 
factors that could give rise to the discontinuance of sfas include deregulation  a change in the regulators approach to setting rates from cost based regulation to another form of regulation  competition that limited our ability to sell utility services or products at rates that will recover costs  or regulatory actions that limit rate relief to a level insufficient to recover costs 
there are currently no regulatory proceedings  court actions or pending legislative proposals to adopt electric industry restructuring in vermont 
legislation has been introduced in the vermont legislature that would permit but not require the company to negotiate with individual customers to permit such customers to procure their own electric power supply requirements  subject to vpsb approval 
we cannot predict whether this legislation will be enacted 
if enacted  the company would not negotiate any such arrangement unless  in our estimation  the arrangement assured the company of full recovery of any resulting stranded costs and that the company s financial condition would not otherwise be adversely affected 
the largest category of our potential stranded costs is future costs under long term power purchase contracts  which  based on current forecasts  are above market 
the magnitude of our stranded costs is largely dependent upon the future wholesale market price of power 
we have discussed various market price scenarios with interested parties for the purpose of identifying stranded costs 
based on preliminary market price assumptions  which are likely to change  we estimate the company s stranded costs to be between million and million over the life of the company s current contracts 
if vermont adopted retail competition or some other form of electric industry restructuring or if the vpsb issued a regulatory order containing provisions that did not allow the company to recover above market power costs  the company could be required to estimate and record losses immediately  on an undiscounted basis  for any above market power purchase contracts and other costs which are probable of not being recoverable from customers  to the extent that those costs are estimable 
customer concentration risk ibm  the company s largest customer  operates a manufacturing facility in essex junction  vermont 
ibm s electricity requirements for its facility accounted for approximately   and percent of the company s retail mwh sales in   and  respectively  and   and percent of the company s retail operating revenues in   and  respectively 
no other retail customer accounted for more than one percent of the company s revenue in any year 
since  the company has had agreements with ibm with respect to electricity sales above agreed upon base load levels 
on december   the vpsb approved a new three year agreement between the company and ibm  ending december  the price of power under the agreement is above our marginal costs of providing incremental service to ibm 
the vpsb approval provides that the agreement automatically terminates if ibm s full time equivalent employment level at its vermont facility served by the agreement drops by more than percent from the level on the date of vpsb approval 
ibm has reduced its vermont workforce by approximately  since  to a level of approximately  employees 
company revenue from sales of electricity to ibm declined million in compared with our operating results were not adversely impacted by the reduction in sales to ibm due to continued revenue growth in other customer classes and because the gross margin on sales to ibm is relatively low 
if we experienced a material reduction in earnings as a result of significantly lower retail sales  we would seek a retail rate increase from the vpsb 
the company is permitted to seek such a rate increase request under our approved rate plan 
we are not aware of any plans by ibm to further reduce production at its vermont facility 
we currently estimate  based on a number of projected variables  that a hypothetical shutdown of the ibm facility would require a retail rate increase for all our remaining customers in the range of five to eight percent 
pension and postretirement health care risk other critical accounting policies involve the company s defined benefit pension and postretirement health care benefit plans 
the reported costs of these plans depend upon numerous factors relating to actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience 
pension and postretirement health care costs are affected by actual employee demographics  company contributions to the plans  earnings on plan assets  and  for our postretirement health care plan  health care cost trends 
the company contributed million and million to its pension plan during and  respectively  and we expect to contribute between and million during our pension and postretirement health care benefit plan assets consist of equity and fixed income investments 
fluctuations in actual equity market returns  as well as changes in general interest rates  may increase or decrease costs in future periods 
changes in assumptions regarding current discount rates and expected rates of return on plan assets could also increase or decrease recorded defined benefit plan costs 
on december   the company s employees ratified a four year labor agreement that provides annual wage increases of between and percent and improved k and pension benefits for employees 
the new labor agreement caps future postretirement healthcare employee benefits provided by the company for the majority of the present workforce 
the cap on postretirement healthcare benefits is set approximately percent above costs and grows at a percent annual rate 
this cap should reduce the rate at which postretirement healthcare expenses grow in the future 
as a result of our plan asset experience  at december   the company was required to recognize an additional minimum liability of million  net of applicable income taxes 
the liability was recorded as a reduction to common equity through a charge to other comprehensive income oci 
favorable pension plan investment returns during reduced the oci charge and related net liability by  the oci charge and the oci benefit had no effect on net income for either year 
weather the company now uses weather insurance to mitigate some of the risk of lost electricity sales caused by unfavorable weather conditions 
the company has purchased weather insurance coverage for coverage is based on cumulative variations from normal weather  measured in net heating and cooling degree days

power contract commitments on february   the company entered into a contract with morgan stanley the morgan stanley contract designed to manage price risks associated with changing fossil fuel prices 
in august  the morgan stanley contract was modified and extended to december  under the morgan stanley contract  on a daily basis  and at morgan stanley s discretion  we sell power to morgan stanley from either i all or part of our portfolio of power resources at predefined operating and pricing parameters or ii any power resources available to us  provided that sales of power from sources other than company owned generation comply with the predefined operating and pricing parameters 
morgan stanley sells to the company  at a predefined price  power sufficient to serve pre established load requirements 
morgan stanley is also responsible for scheduling supply resources

morgan stanley provides no coverage against major unscheduled power supply outages 
beginning january   the company will reduce the power that it sells to morgan stanley 
some of our power supply resources  including purchases pursuant to our hydro quebec and vermont yankee contracts  which were sold to morgan stanley through  will no longer be included in the morgan stanley contract 
this reduction in sales to morgan stanley is expected to reduce wholesale revenues by approximately million and correspondingly to reduce power supply expense by a similar amount 
we do not expect this change to adversely affect the company s opportunity to earn its allowed rate of return during the company s current purchases under the vjo contract with hydro quebec are as follows schedule b megawatts of firm capacity and associated energy to be delivered at the highgate interconnection for twenty years beginning in september  and schedule c megawatts of firm capacity and associated energy to be delivered at interconnections to be determined at any time for years  beginning in november our contracts with hydro quebec contain cross default provisions that allow hydro quebec to invoke step up provisions under which the other vermont utilities that are also parties to the contract would be required to purchase their proportionate share of the power supply entitlement of any defaulting utility 
the company is not aware of any instance where this provision has been invoked by hydro quebec 
under the company s arrangement  hydro quebec paid million to the company in in return for this payment  we provided hydro quebec options for the purchase of power 
commencing april   and effective through the term of the vjo contract  which ends in  hydro quebec may purchase up to  mwh on an annual basis option a at the vjo contract energy price  which is substantially below current market prices 
the cumulative amount of energy that may be purchased under option a may not exceed  mwh  mwh in each contract year 
over the same period  hydro quebec may exercise an option to purchase up to  mwh on an annual basis at the vjo contract energy price option b 
the cumulative amount of energy that may be purchased under option b may not exceed  mwh 
as of december   hydro quebec had purchased  mwh under option b 
the company expects hydro quebec to call its remaining entitlements under option b during and in  hydro quebec exercised option a and option b  and called for delivery to third parties at a net expense to the company of approximately million  including capacity charges 
in  hydro quebec exercised option a and called for deliveries to third parties at a net expense to the company of approximately million  including capacity charges 
in  hydro quebec exercised option a and option b  and called for deliveries to third parties at a net expense to the company of approximately million  including capacity charges 
we believe that it is probable that hydro quebec will call options a and b for  and the company has purchased replacement power at a net cost of million 
the company has also covered percent of expected calls during at a net cost of million 
vermont yankee nuclear power corporation on july   vermont yankee completed the sale of its nuclear power plant to envy 
as part of the sale transaction  vermont yankee entered into a power purchase agreement ppa with envy pursuant to which envy is obligated to provide percent of the plant output to the company through  which represents approximately percent of our energy requirements 
prices under the ppa range from to per mwh for the period beginning january  substantially lower than our forecasted cost if vermont yankee had continued to own and operate the plant facilities 
in  contract prices ranged from to under the ppa  higher than the forecasted cost of continued ownership 
the ppa contains a provision known as the low market adjuster  which calls for a downward adjustment in the price if market prices for electricity fall by defined amounts beginning in november if market prices rise  however  ppa prices are not adjusted upward 
the company remains responsible for procuring replacement energy at market prices during periods of scheduled or unscheduled outages at the envy plant 
the company received million in october  representing its share of the vermont yankee power plant sale proceeds  and used the proceeds to retire debt 
the vermont yankee sale required various regulatory approvals  all of which were granted on terms acceptable to the parties to the transaction 
certain intervenor parties to the vpsb approval proceeding appealed the vpsb approval to the vermont supreme court 
the court rejected the appeal and affirmed the vpsb approval during other operating expenses other operating expenses increased million  or percent  in compared with primarily due to increased employee benefit expenses and expenses related to corporate governance 
a cap on post retirement healthcare benefits  improved market returns and benefit plan funding should reduce growth in administrative and general expenses in other operating expenses decreased million  or percent  in compared with the decrease was primarily due to reduced consulting expenses of approximately million and reduced distribution expenses of million 
transmission expenses transmission expenses decreased  or percent  in compared with  due to decreased congestion costs allocated by iso new england to vermont utilities in conjunction with transition to a new standard market design smd 
see discussion below 
transmission expenses increased million  or percent  in compared with the company s relative share of transmission expenses varies with the peak demand recorded on vermont s transmission system 
the company s share of those expenses increased due to its increased load growth  relative to other vermont utilities  and also because of increased transmission investment by velco 
the independent system operator of new england iso ne or iso new england was created to manage the operations of the new england power pool nepool  effective may  iso ne operates a market for all new england states for purchasers and sellers of electricity in the deregulated wholesale energy markets 
sellers place bids for the sale of their generation or purchased power resources and if demand is high enough the output from those resources is sold 
during  the ferc accepted iso ne s request to implement a smd governing wholesale energy sales in new england 
iso ne implemented its smd plan on march  smd includes a system of locational marginal pricing of energy  under which prices are determined by zone  and based in part on transmission congestion experienced in each zone 
currently  the state of vermont constitutes a single zone under the plan  although pricing may eventually be determined on a more localized nodal basis 
iso ne and nepool have committed to facilitation of a stakeholder process to examine alternative pricing options  including alternatives to nodal pricing  and to file their report with ferc in july we believe that nodal pricing could result in a material adverse impact on our power supply and or transmission costs  if adopted 
on october   iso ne  together with new england s principal transmission system owners including velco  filed a request for approval of a regional transmission organization for new england rto ne 
the proposed rto ne would become the provider of regional transmission service in new england  with operational control of the bulk power system and responsibility for administering markets currently operated and administered by iso ne 
if the rto is approved by ferc  the current iso ne agreement with the new england power pool nepool  the restated nepool agreement  the nepool open access transmission tariff and individual local tariffs currently maintained by new england transmission owners would terminate and be superseded by new rto ne agreements 
also on october   certain transmission owners in new england  including the company  reached an agreement to submit a tariff  agreements and other documents to ferc to include costs associated with certain transmission facilities  known as the highgate facilities  of which the company is a part owner  in region wide rates as set forth in the rto ne proposal 
the company cannot predict whether or when ferc will approve the rto ne proposal  or what modifications may be made to the proposal while pending before ferc 
velco  the owner and operator of vermont s principal electric transmission system assets  has proposed a project to substantially upgrade vermont s transmission system the northwest reliability project  principally to support reliability and eliminate transmission constraints in northwestern vermont  including most of the company s service territory 
we own approximately percent of velco 
the proposed northwest reliability project must be approved by the vpsb 
several vermont municipalities  citizen groups and individuals have intervened in the vpsb proceedings to oppose or request modifications to the project 
if approved  the project is estimated to cost approximately million through velco intends to finance the costs of constructing the northwest reliability project in part through increased equity investment 
the company plans to invest approximately million in velco to support this and other transmission projects through under current nepool and iso ne rules  which require qualifying large transmission project costs to be shared among all new england utilities  most of the costs of the northwest reliability project will be allocated throughout the new england region  with vermont utilities responsible for approximately five percent of allocated costs 
in august  a coalition of new england public utility commissions and other parties challenged the nepool and iso ne transmission cost allocation rules 
on december   ferc rejected this challenge 
ferc s order is subject to pending requests for rehearing and has been appealed to the us court of appeals for the dc circuit 
if the current transmission cost allocation rules are modified or eliminated  vermont utilities  including the company  could be required to bear a greater proportion  and potentially all  of the cost of the northwest reliability project 
maintenance expenses maintenance expenses increased  or percent  in compared with  due to increased expenditures related to hydroelectric generation and transmission facilities 
maintenance expenses increased million  or percent  in compared with due to increased expenditures related to storm damage and right of way maintenance programs 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense decreased  or percent  in compared with due to reductions in amortization of conservation and software programs  partially offset by increased depreciation of utility plant in service 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased  or percent  in compared with due to reductions in depreciation of utility plant in service partially offset by increased amortization of software costs

income tax expense decreased  in compared with due to a decrease in the company s taxable income 
other income other income decreased  or percent  in compared with due primarily to reduced earnings on investment in vermont yankee as a result of the sale of the vermont yankee plant in other income increased  or percent  in compared with due primarily to vermont yankee recognition of deferred tax assets arising in conjunction with the sale of the vermont yankee plant  offset in part by payments made to vermont yankee owners located outside of vermont necessary to close the sale of the vermont yankee plant 
interest expense interest expense increased  or percent  in compared with primarily due to a million long term debt issuance in december interest expense decreased  or percent  in compared with primarily due to scheduled and early redemptions of long term debt and reduced short term borrowing rates offset in part by higher average balances for short term borrowings 
dividends on preferred stock dividends on preferred stock decreased  or percent  in compared with  due to the repurchase of all outstanding preferred stock during dividends on preferred stock decreased  or percent  in compared with due to the repurchase of all outstanding preferred stock other than the percent class b shares 
environmental matters the electric industry typically uses or generates a range of potentially hazardous products in its operations 
we must meet various land  water  air and aesthetic requirements as administered by local  state and federal regulatory agencies 
we believe that we are in substantial compliance with these requirements  and that there are no outstanding material complaints about our compliance with present environmental protection regulations 
pine street barge canal superfund site in  the company entered into a united states district court consent decree constituting a final settlement with the united states environmental protection agency epa  the state of vermont and numerous other parties of claims relating to a federal superfund site in burlington  vermont  known as the pine street barge canal 
the consent decree resolves claims by the epa for past site costs  natural resource damage claims and claims for past and future remediation costs 
the consent decree also provides for the design and implementation of response actions at the site 
in  the company expended million to cover its obligations under the consent decree and we have estimated total future costs of the company s future obligations under the consent decree to be million 
the estimated liability is not discounted  and it is possible that our estimate of future costs could change by a material amount 
we have recorded a regulatory asset of million to reflect unrecovered past and future pine street costs 
pursuant to the company s rate plan  as approved by the vpsb  the company will begin to amortize past unrecovered costs in the company will amortize the full amount of incurred costs over years without a return 
the amortization will be allowed in future rates  without disallowance or adjustment  until fully amortized 
rates retail rate cases on december   the vpsb approved our rate plan  jointly proposed earlier in the year by the company and the vermont department of public service 
the rate plan covers the period from through and includes the following principal elements the company s rates will remain unchanged through the rate plan allows the company to raise rates percent  effective january   and an additional percent  effective january   if the increases are supported by cost of service schedules submitted days prior to the effective dates 
if the company s cost of service filings in or establish that a lesser rate increase is required for the company to meet its revenue requirements  the company will implement the lesser rate increase 
the company may seek additional rate increases in extraordinary circumstances  such as severe storm repair costs  natural disasters  extended unanticipated unit outages  or significant losses of customer load 
the company s allowed return on equity is reduced from percent to percent  for the period january  through december  during the same period  the company s earnings on core utility operations are capped at percent 
any excess earnings in will be applied to reduce regulatory assets 
excess earnings in or will be refunded to customers as a credit on customer bills or applied to reduce regulatory assets  as the department directs 
the company will carry forward into million in deferred revenue remaining at december   from the company s settlement order summarized below 
these revenues will be applied in to offset increased costs or  if applicable  reduce regulatory assets as determined by the dps 
the company will amortize recover certain regulatory assets  including pine street barge canal environmental site costs and past demand side management program costs  beginning in january  with those amortizations to be allowed in future rates 
pine street costs will be recovered over a twenty year period without a return 
the company will file with the vpsb in early a new fully allocated cost of service study and rate re design  which will allocate the company s revenue requirement among all customer classes on the basis of current costs 
the new rate design will be subject to vpsb approval and is not expected to adversely affect operating results 
the company and the department have agreed to work cooperatively to develop and propose an alternative regulation plan as authorized by legislation enacted in vermont in if the company and department agree on such a plan  and it is approved by the vpsb  the alternative regulation plan would supersede the rate plan 
in january  the vpsb issued the settlement order  which included the following the company received a rate increase of percent above existing rates and prior temporary rate increases became permanent  rates were set at levels that recover the company s vjo contract costs  effectively ending the regulatory disallowances experienced by the company from through  seasonal rates were eliminated in april  which generated approximately million in additional cash flow in  which was deferred and available to be used to offset increased costs during and  and the company agreed to an earnings cap on core utility operations of percent return on equity  with amounts earned over the limit being used to write off regulatory assets 
the settlement order also imposed two additional conditions the company and customers shall share equally any premium above book value realized by the company in any future merger  acquisition or asset sale  subject to an million limit on the customers share  adjusted for inflation  and the company s further investment in non utility operations is restricted until new rates go into effect  which will occur in january liquidity and capital resources construction and investments our capital requirements result from the need to construct facilities or to invest in programs to meet anticipated customer demand for electric service 
the company plans to invest up to million in velco through  subject to regulatory approval of the northwest reliability project 
see detailed discussion under transmission expenses 
the company offers utility services  primarily line construction and electrical services  principally to municipal and business customers 
sales of these services have grown from approximately  in to approximately million in sales of these services have allowed the company to serve its customers more efficiently and have improved cash flow 
future capital expenditures are expected to approximate million annually 
expected reductions in pine street remediation costs should be offset by increased generation expenditures 
capital expenditures  net of customer advances for construction  over the past three years and forecasted for are as follows generation transmission distribution other total in thousands actual forecast other includes pine street barge canal expenditures of million in  million in  million in and an estimated million in dividend policy the annual dividend was per share for the year ended december  the annual dividend rate was increased by the company s board of directors from per share to per share beginning with the quarterly dividend declared in december on february   the annual dividend rate was increased from per share to per share  a payout ratio of approximately percent based on earnings 
the company expects to increase the dividend in the first quarter of each year until the payout ratio falls between percent and percent of anticipated earnings 
we believe this payout ratio to be consistent with that of other electric utilities having similar risk profiles 
financing and capitalization at december   our capitalization consisted of approximately percent common equity and percent debt  inclusive of the company s capital lease obligations 
during june  the company negotiated a day revolving credit agreement the fleet sovereign agreement with fleet financial services fleet joined by sovereign bank 
the fleet sovereign agreement is for million  unsecured  and allows the company to choose any blend of a daily variable prime rate and a fixed term libor based rate

in the event of a change in the company s first mortgage bond credit rating to below investment grade  scheduled payments under the company s first mortgage bonds would not be affected 
such a change would require the company to post what would currently amount to a million bond under our remediation agreement with the epa regarding the pine street barge canal site 
the morgan stanley contract requires credit assurances if the company s first mortgage bond credit ratings are lowered to below investment grade by any two of the three credit rating agencies listed above

other risks in march  voters in the town of rockingham  vermont rockingham approved an article authorizing rockingham to create a municipal utility and to acquire the electric distribution systems of the company and or central vermont public service corporation located within the town 
in november  rockingham notified the company that the town intended to initiate proceedings before the town selectboard to condemn the company s distribution and associated property located within the town 
the company sought and obtained in december a preliminary injunction from the state superior court prohibiting the town from proceeding with condemnation before the selectboard 
the company successfully argued that vermont law required rockingham to pursue any such municipalization effort by petition to the vpsb  which is required to determine both the fair value of any assets subject to municipalization and the amount of damages to the utility caused by severance of the property subject to municipalization 
the preliminary injunction remains in effect and rockingham has not filed any petition with the vpsb seeking to municipalize assets 
the company receives annual revenues of approximately million from its customers in rockingham 
should rockingham create a municipal system  the company would vigorously pursue its right to receive just compensation from rockingham 
such compensation would include full reimbursement for company assets  if acquired  and full reimbursement of any other costs associated with the loss of customers in rockingham  to assure that neither our remaining customers nor our shareholders effectively subsidize a rockingham municipal utility 
in  the owners of property along the shoreline of joe s pond  an impoundment located in danville  vermont  created by the company s west danville hydroelectric generating facility  filed an inquiry with the vpsb seeking review of certain dam improvements made by the company in  alleging that the company did not obtain all necessary regulatory approvals for the improvements and that the company s improvements and subsequent operation of the dam have caused flooding of the shoreline and property damage 
the company has petitioned the vpsb to make additional dam improvements at the facility at an estimated cost of  the vpsb must approve the company s petition before the proposed improvements can be implemented 
this regulatory proceeding is pending and the company is unable to predict whether the company s petition will be approved or whether the vpsb will impose regulatory conditions or penalties in connection with this proceeding 
governance during  the securities and exchange commission sec issued a number of rules amending disclosure requirements for public company annual reports 
in order to comply with such rules  the company makes the following disclosures the company s board of directors has determined that david coates  who serves on the company s audit committee  qualifies as an independent financial expert under sec rules 
the company has adopted a code of ethics and conduct that applies to all company directors and employees  including the company s principal executive officer  principal financial officer  principal accounting officer and persons performing similar functions

upon request  the company will provide a copy of its code of ethics to any person without charge 
please send your inquiries to attention of investor relations for the company  acorn lane  colchester  vermont management believes the company to be in compliance with all governance and disclosure requirements of the new york stock exchange  the sec  and applicable federal and state laws  including the sarbanes oxley act 
nuclear decommissioning the staff of the sec has questioned certain current accounting practices of the electric utility industry regarding the recognition  measurement and classification of decommissioning costs for nuclear generating units in financial statements 
in response to these questions  the financial accounting standards board fasb had agreed to review the accounting for closure and removal costs  including decommissioning 
the fasb issued a new statement in august for accounting for asset retirement obligations  which provides guidance on accounting for nuclear plant decommissioning costs  as well as other asset retirement costs 
the company does not believe that changes in such accounting  if required  would have an adverse effect on the results of our operations due to our current and future ability to recover decommissioning costs through rates 
effects of inflation financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and report operating results in terms of historic costs 
this accounting provides reasonable financial statements but does not always take inflation into consideration 
as rate recovery is based on these historical costs and known and measurable changes  the company is able to receive some rate relief for inflation 
it does not receive immediate rate recovery relating to fixed costs associated with company assets 
such fixed costs are recovered based on historic figures 
any effects of inflation on plant costs are generally offset by the fact that these assets are financed through long term debt
