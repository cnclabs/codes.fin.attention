overview the company operates as a full service investment bank and institutional securities firm focused on the middle market 
the company offers financial advisory  capital raising  mergers and acquisitions  and restructuring services to small and mid cap companies and provides trade execution in equity  high yield  convertible and international securities  as well as research and asset management capabilities  to institutional investors 
the company also offers correspondent clearing  prime brokerage  private client services and securities lending services 
the company believes that its middle market niche is largely under served by its competitors 
the company actively looks to enhance its middle market position by continued leveraging of its internal resources and through acquisitions and strategic partnering 
in  the company began the development of a broadly based asset management infrastructure which will support the development of various investment strategies including those focused on long short equity  real assets  fixed income and foreign exchange through a variety of pooled investment vehicles 
the company expects to support and make investments in these various vehicles 
furthermore  the addition of quarterdeck in  with its specialization in mergers and acquisitions in the global aerospace  defense  and federal information technology industries and the addition of broadview in  with its specialization in mergers and acquisitions in the information  communications and healthcare technology industries represent additional important continuations of the company s strategy to create the leading investment bank serving middle market companies and their investors 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and related notes 
actual results will inevitably differ from estimates 
these differences could be material to the financial statements 
the company believes its application of accounting policies and the estimates required therein are reasonable 
these accounting policies and estimates are constantly reevaluated  and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate a change 
historically  the company has found its application of accounting policies to be appropriate  and actual results have not differed materially from those determined using necessary estimates 

table of contents management believes its critical accounting policies policies that are both material to the financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments are its valuation methodologies applied to investments and to securities positions 
investments are stated at estimated fair value as determined in good faith by management 
generally  the company initially values these investments at cost and requires that changes in value be established by meaningful third party transactions or a significant change in the financial condition or operating performance of the issuer  unless meaningful developments occur that otherwise warrant a change in the valuation of an investment 
factors considered in valuing individual investments include  without limitation  available market prices  reported net asset values  type of security  purchase price  purchases of the same or similar securities by other investors  marketability  restrictions on disposition  current financial position and operating results  and other pertinent information 
furthermore  judgment is used to value certain securities eg  private securities  a securities  less liquid securities  if quoted market prices are not available 
these valuations are made with consideration for various assumptions  including time value  yield curve  volatility factors  liquidity  market prices on comparable securities and other factors 
the subjectivity involved in this process makes these valuations inherently less reliable than quoted market prices 
the company believes that its comprehensive risk management policies and procedures serve to monitor the appropriateness of the assumptions used 
the use of different assumptions  however  could produce materially different estimates of fair value

most of these activities are hedged by related foreign currency liabilities or by forward exchange contracts 
however  the company is still subject to some foreign currency risk 
a change in the foreign currency rates could create either a foreign currency transaction gain loss recorded in the company s consolidated statements of earnings or a foreign currency translation adjustment to the stockholders equity section of the company s consolidated statements of financial condition 
effects of inflation based on today s modest inflationary rates and because the company s assets are primarily monetary in nature  consisting of cash and cash equivalents  securities and receivables  the company believes that its assets are not significantly affected by inflation

the company seeks to identify  assess  monitor and manage the following principal risks involved in its business activities market  credit  operational and legal 
risk management at the company is a multi faceted process that requires communication  judgment and knowledge of financial products and markets 
senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and requires specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification  assessment and control of various risks 
the company s risk management policies  procedures and methodologies are fluid in nature and are subject to ongoing review and modification 
market risk 
the potential for changes in the value of the financial instruments the company owns is referred to as market risk 
the company s market risk generally represents the risk of loss that may result from a change in the value of a financial instrument as a result of fluctuations in interest rates  credit spreads  equity prices and the correlation among them  along with the level of volatility 
interest rate risks result primarily from exposure to changes in the yield curve  the volatility of interest rates  and credit spreads 
equity price risks result from exposure to changes in prices and volatilities of individual equities  equity baskets and equity indices 
the company makes dealer markets in equity and debt securities 
to facilitate customer order flow  the company may be required to own equity and debt securities in its trading and inventory accounts 
the majority of the company s trading and inventory accounts consist of fixed income debt instruments 
the company attempts to hedge its exposure to market risk by managing its net long or short position 
due to imperfections in correlations  gains and losses can occur even for positions that are hedged 
position limits in trading and inventory accounts are established and monitored on an ongoing basis 
each day  consolidated position and exposure reports are prepared and distributed to various levels of management  which enable management to monitor inventory levels and results of the trading groups

new accounting standards on consolidations 
in december  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
revised december  consolidation of variable interest entities  which addresses how a business enterprise should evaluate whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity through means other than voting rights and accordingly should consolidate the entity 
fin r replaces fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  which was issued in january the company will be required to apply fin r to variable interests in variable interest entities vies created after december  for variable interests in vies created before january   the interpretation will be applied beginning on january  for any vies that must be consolidated under fin r that were created before january   the assets  liabilities and noncontrolling interests of the vie initially would be measured at their carrying amounts with any difference between the net amount added to the balance sheet and any previously recognized interest being recognized as the cumulative effect of an accounting change 
if determining the carrying amounts is not practicable  fair value at the date fin r first applies may be used to measure the assets  liabilities and noncontrolling interest of the vie 
the company is evaluating the impact of applying fin r to existing vies in which it has variable interests and has not yet completed this analysis 
as the company continues to evaluate the impact of applying fin r  additional entities may be identified that would need to be consolidated by the company 
fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  addressed the consolidation by companies of variable interest entities as defined in the interpretation 
a company is required to consolidate a variable interest entity if that company is the primary beneficiary as defined by the interpretation 
for purposes of determining whether it is the primary beneficiary  a company is required to treat variable interests in the variable interest entity held by its related parties as its own interests 
the company together with its employees related parties is the primary beneficiary of jefferies employees opportunity fund jeof  one of the three high yield funds that the company manages 
therefore  jeof starting in the third quarter of is consolidated into the company and is no longer treated as an investment 
factors affecting the company s business in addition to the factors mentioned in the rest of this report  the company is also affected by changes in general economic and business conditions  acts of war  terrorism and natural disasters 
changing conditions in financial markets and the economy could result in decreased revenues 
as an investment banking and securities firm  changes in the financial markets or economic conditions  in the united states and elsewhere in the world  could adversely affect the company in many ways  including the following a market downturn could lead to a decline in the volume of transactions executed for customers and  therefore  to a decline in the revenues received from commissions and spreads  unfavorable financial or economic conditions would likely reduce the number and size of transactions in underwriting  financial advisory and other services 
investment banking revenues  in the form of financial advisory and underwriting fees  are directly related to the number and size of the transactions in which the company participates and would therefore be adversely affected by a sustained market downturn  adverse changes in the market could lead to a reduction in revenues from principal transactions and commissions 
continued increases in the company s investments would make the company more susceptible to adverse changes in the market  adverse changes in the market could also lead to a reduction in revenues from asset management fees 

table of contents proprietary trading activities expose the company to risk of loss 
a significant amount of the company s revenues are derived from proprietary trading in which the company acts as principal 
the company may incur trading losses relating to the purchase  sale or short sale of high yield  international  convertible  equity securities  futures and commodities for its own account and from other program or proprietary trading 
in any period  the company may experience losses as a result of price declines  lack of trading volume  and illiquidity 
from time to time  the company may have large position concentrations in a single security  securities of a single issuer or issuers engaged in a specific industry 
in general  because the company s inventory of securities is marked to market on a daily basis  any downward price movement in those securities will result in a reduction of the company s operating profits 
increased competition may adversely affect the company s revenues and profitability 
all aspects of the company s business are intensely competitive 
the company competes directly with numerous other brokers and dealers  investment banking firms and banks 
in addition to competition from firms currently in the securities business  there has been increasing competition from others offering financial services  including automated trading and other services based on technological innovations 
the company believes that the principal factors affecting competition involve market focus  reputation  the abilities of professional personnel  the relative price of the service and products being offered and the quality of service 
increased competition in these areas  or others  or an adverse change in the company s competitive position could lead to a reduction of business and therefore a reduction of revenues and profits 
competition also extends to the hiring and retention of highly skilled employees 
a competitor may be successful in hiring away an employee or group of employees  which may result in the company losing business formerly serviced by such employee or employees 
competition can also raise the company s costs of hiring and retaining the key employees it needs to effectively execute its business plan 
the company s business is substantially dependent on the company s chief executive officer 
the company s future success depends to a significant degree on the skills  experience and efforts of richard b 
handler  the company s chief executive officer 
the company does not have an employment agreement with mr 
handler 
the loss of his services could compromise the company s ability to effectively operate its business 
in addition  in the event that mr 
handler ceases to actively manage the three funds that invest on a pari passu basis with the company s high yield division  investors in those funds would have the right to withdraw from the funds 
although the company has substantial key man life insurance covering mr 
handler  the proceeds from the policy may not be sufficient to offset any loss in business 
the company s business depends on its ability to maintain adequate levels of personnel 
the company has recently made substantial increases in the number of its personnel 
if a significant number of the company s key personnel leave  or if the company s business volume increases significantly over current volume  the company could be compelled to hire additional personnel 
at that time  there could be a shortage of qualified and  in some cases  licensed personnel whom the company could hire 
this could hinder the company s ability to expand or cause a backlog in the company s ability to conduct its business  including the handling of investment banking transactions and the processing of brokerage orders  all of which could harm the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
extensive regulation of the company s business limits its activities and  if it violates these regulations  may subject it to significant penalties 
the securities industry in the united states is subject to extensive regulation under both federal and state laws 
the securities and exchange commission is the federal agency responsible for the administration of federal securities laws 
in addition  self regulatory organizations  principally nasd and the securities exchanges  are actively involved in the regulation of broker dealers 
securities firms are also subject to regulation by state securities commissions and state attorneys general in those states in which they do business 
broker dealers are subject to regulations which cover all aspects of the securities business  including 
table of contents sales methods  trade practices among broker dealers  use and safekeeping of customers funds and securities  capital structure of securities firms  anti money laundering  record keeping and the conduct of directors  officers and employees 
the commission  self regulatory organizations  state securities commissions and state attorneys general may conduct administrative proceedings which can result in censure  fine  suspension  expulsion of a broker dealer  its officers or employees  or revocation of broker dealer licenses 
additional legislation  changes in rules promulgated by the commission and self regulatory organizations  or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules  may directly affect the company s mode of operation and its profitability 
legal liability may harm the company s business 
many aspects of the company s business involve substantial risks of liability  and in the normal course of business  the company has been named as a defendant or co defendant in lawsuits involving primarily claims for damages 
additionally  the company s expansion into private client services involves an aspect of the business that has historically had a heightened risk of more litigation than the company s institutional business 
the risks associated with potential legal liabilities often may be difficult to assess or quantify and their existence and magnitude often remain unknown for substantial periods of time 
substantial legal liability against the company could have a material financial effect or cause significant reputational harm to the company  which in turn could seriously harm its business prospects 
operational risks may disrupt the company s business  result in regulatory action against it or limit its growth 
the company faces operational risks arising from mistakes made in the confirmation or settlement of transactions or from transactions not being properly recorded  evaluated or accounted 
the company s business is highly dependent on its ability to process  on a daily basis  a large number of transactions across numerous and diverse markets  and the transactions it processes have become increasingly complex 
consequently  the company relies heavily on its financial  accounting and other data processing systems 
if any of these systems do not operate properly or are disabled  the company could suffer financial loss  a disruption of our business  liability to clients  regulatory intervention or reputational damage 
the inability of the company s systems to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions could also constrain its ability to expand its business

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company maintains equity securities inventories in exchange listed  nasdaq  otc bulletin board  pink sheet and private securities on both a long and short basis as well as various partnership interests
