item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following is a discussion of our results of operations and financial position for the periods described below 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included herein 
our discussion of our results of operations and financial condition includes various forward looking statements about our markets  the demand for our products and services and our future results 
these statements are based on certain assumptions that we consider reasonable 
our actual results may differ materially from these indicated forward looking statements 
for information about these assumptions and other risks and exposures relating to our business and our company  you should refer to the section entitled forward looking statements and risk factors which may affect future results 
restatement of and financial statements in our financial statements for the years ended december  and  we deducted our preferred stock dividends related to our redeemable preferred stock from our accumulated deficit in our consolidated balance sheets and our consolidated statements of stockholders equity 
we recently became aware that sec rules require that when a company has an accumulated deficit  preferred stock dividends should be deducted from additional paid in capital 
therefore  we have revised our financial statements to deduct preferred stock dividends previously charged to accumulated deficit from additional paid in capital 
this revision has no impact on our total consolidated stockholders equity 
the revision also had no effect on our consolidated statements of operations or statements of cash flows for or this table recaps the adjustments related to the revision of our preferred stock dividends for the periods presented in thousands as as reported revision revised balance january  additional paid in capital    accumulated deficit    balance december  additional paid in capital    accumulated deficit    balance december  additional paid in capital    accumulated deficit    our financial statements for the year ended december   were audited by arthur andersen llp  who issued an unqualified opinion on our financial statements 
since arthur andersen has ceased operations  they are no longer available to audit the revised reporting of the preferred stock dividends and re issue their audit report 
as we were unable to have the adjustments pertaining to our financial statements audited by our filing deadline  the arthur andersen unqualified opinion has been removed and our financial statements and related note disclosures contained herein are unaudited and are labeled as such 
as a result  this annual report on form k does not completely satisfy the financial statement requirements of regulation s x 
since we are unable to file three years of audited financial information in this annual report on form k as required under rules and of regulation s x  our reports filed under the securities exchange act of the exchange act will not be in full compliance with the requirements of the exchange act 
as a result  the effectiveness of our registration statement on form s no 
will be suspended  we will be unable to issue shares under our stock option plans and agreements 
in addition  we will not be in compliance with item a of schedule a under the exchange act in connection with our solicitation of proxies for our annual meeting of shareholders 
during any period when we are not current with our sec reports  neither our affiliates nor any person that purchased shares from us in a private offering during the preceding two years will be able to sell their shares in public markets pursuant to rule under the securities act of because of the recent identification of this issue  it was impracticable to complete a re audit of our financial statements by our filing deadline 
while the consolidated financial statements for are unaudited  they include all adjustments consisting of a normal and recurring nature that are  in the opinion of management  necessary for a fair presentation of the financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows for that year 
the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended and have been audited by pricewaterhousecoopers llp 
background we generate substantially all of our revenue by providing water and wastewater residuals management services to municipal and industrial customers 
we provide our customers with complete  vertically integrated services and capabilities  including facility operations  facility cleanout services  regulatory compliance  dewatering  collection and transportation  composting  drying and pelletization  product marketing  incineration  alkaline stabilization  and land application 
we currently serve more than  customers in states and the district of columbia 
our contracts typically have inflation price adjustments  renewal clauses and broad force majeure provisions 
in  we experienced a contract retention rate both renewals and rebids of approximately percent 
we categorize our revenues into five types contract  purchase order po  product sales  design build construction and event work 
contract revenues are generated primarily from land application  collection and transportation services  dewatering  incineration  composting  drying and pelletization services and facility operations and maintenance  and are typically performed under a contract with terms ranging from to years 
contract revenues accounted for approximately percent and percent of total revenues in and  respectively 
purchase order revenues are primarily from facility operations  maintenance services  and collection and transportation services where services are performed on a recurring basis  but not under a long term contract 
purchase order revenues accounted for approximately three percent and four percent of total revenues in and  respectively 
product sales revenues are primarily generated from sales of composted and pelletized biosolids from internal and external facilities 
revenues from product sales accounted for approximately five percent and four percent of total revenues in and  respectively 
design build construction revenues are derived from construction projects where we act as the general contractor to design and build a biosolids facility such as a drying and pelletization facility  composting facility  incineration facility or a dewatering facility 
revenues from construction projects accounted for approximately two percent and four percent of total revenues in and  respectively 
event project revenues are typically generated from digester or lagoon cleanout projects and temporary dewatering projects 
revenue from event projects accounted for approximately seven percent of total revenues in and revenues under our facilities operations and maintenance contracts are recognized either when wastewater residuals enter the facility or when the residuals have been processed  depending on the contract terms 
all other revenues under service contracts are recognized when the service is performed 
revenues from design build construction projects are accounted for under the percentage of completion method of accounting 
we provide for losses in connection with long term contracts where an obligation exists to perform services and it becomes evident that the projected contract costs will exceed the related revenue 
our costs relating to service contracts include processing  transportation  spreading and disposal costs  and depreciation of operating assets 
our spreading  transportation and disposal costs can be adversely affected by unusual weather conditions and unseasonably heavy rainfall  which can temporarily reduce the availability of land application 
material must be transported to either a permitted storage facility if available or to a local landfill for disposal 
in either case  this results in additional costs for transporting  storage and disposal of the biosolid materials versus land application in a period of normal weather conditions 
our costs relating to construction contracts primarily include subcontractor costs related to design  permit and general construction 
our selling  general and administrative expenses are comprised of accounting  information systems  marketing  legal  human resources  regulatory compliance  and regional and executive management costs 
historically  we have included amortization of goodwill resulting from acquisitions as a separate line item in our income statement 
effective january   goodwill is no longer amortized in accordance with sfas no

approximately million of the increase in revenues relates to increased volume from service and maintenance contracts and approximately million of the increase in revenue relates to acquisitions

our provision for income taxes differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes 
our tax provision is principally a deferred tax provision that will not significantly impact cash flow since we have significant tax deductions in excess of book deductions and net operating loss carryforwards available to offset taxable income

we have historically financed our acquisitions principally through the issuance of equity and debt securities  our credit facility  and funds provided by operating activities 
historical cash flows cash flows from operating activities 
for the year ended december   cash flows from operating activities decreased to approximately million from approximately million for the same period in  a decrease of approximately million  or percent 
the decrease primarily relates to the decrease in income from operations of million partially offset by cash flow generated from the decrease in prepaid expenses as a result of the change in renewal dates for insurance 
cash flows from investing activities 
for the year ended december   cash flows used for investing activities decreased to approximately million from approximately million for the same period in  a decrease of approximately million

 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas no 
 which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for stock based employee compensation plans and for transactions in which an entity issues its equity instruments to acquire goods and services from nonemployees 
sfas no 
requires  among other things  that compensation cost be calculated for fixed stock options at the grant date by determining fair value using an option pricing model 
we have the option of recognizing the compensation cost over the vesting period as an expense in the income statement or making pro forma disclosures in the notes to the financial statements for employee stock based compensation 
we continue to apply apb opinion no 
and related interpretations in accounting for our plans 
accordingly  no compensation cost has been recognized in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for our stock option plans 
had we elected to apply sfas no

the compensation expense included in the above pro forma data may not be indicative of amounts to be included in future periods as the fair value of options granted prior to was not determined and we expect future grants 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
 asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred and a corresponding increase in the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
subsequently  the asset retirement cost should be allocated to expense using a systematic and rational method 
our asset retirement obligations primarily consist of equipment dismantling and foundation removal at certain facilities and temporary storage facilities 
during the first quarter of  we recorded a charge related to the cumulative effect of change in accounting for asset retirement obligations  net of tax  totaling approximately million approximately million before tax  increased liabilities to approximately million  and increased property  plant and equipment by approximately million 
there was no impact on our cash flows as a result of adopting sfas no

 consolidation of variable interest entities fin no 

fin no 
defines a variable interest entity as an entity in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
fin no 
requires an entity to consolidate a variable interest entity if that entity will absorb a majority of the variable interest entity s expected losses if they occur  receive a majority of the variable interest entity s expected residual returns if they occur  or both 
fin no 
is effective for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after january  for variable interest entities created or acquired prior to february   the provisions of the pronouncement were initially to be effective for the first interim or annual period beginning after june  however  in october  the fasb delayed the effective date of fin no 
on these entities to the first period beginning after december  we determined that we do not have any variable interest entities at december   as defined by the pronouncement 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities under sfas no 
this statement is effective for contracts entered into or modified after september   except for certain exceptions and for hedging relationships designated after september  we adopted sfas no 
in the fourth quarter of and there was no effect on our results of operations or financial position 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
established standards for how an issuer classifies and measures in its statement of financial position certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june   and must be applied prospectively by reporting the cumulative effect of a change in an accounting principle for financial instruments created before the issuance date of the statement and still existing at the beginning of the interim period of adoption 
while we do have mandatory redeemable preferred stock with characteristics of both liabilities and equity  our series d and series e preferred stock is also convertible to shares of our common stock at the option of the holder up until the mandatory redemption date 
additionally  the option feature held by the holder is considered to be substantive as the conversion price was less than the market price at the date of issuance 
based on the above features of the preferred stock  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
critical accounting estimates and assumptions in preparing financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the following are our significant estimates and assumptions made in preparation of our financial statements allowance for doubtful accounts we estimate losses for uncollectible accounts based on the aging of the accounts receivable and the evaluation and the likelihood of success in collecting the receivable 
allowance for doubtful accounts at december  and  was approximately million and million  respectively 
loss contracts we evaluate our revenue producing contracts to determine whether the projected revenues of such contracts exceed the direct cost to service such contracts 
these evaluations include estimates of the future revenues and expenses 
accruals for loss contracts are adjusted based on these evaluations 
property and equipment long lived assets management adopted sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets during the first quarter of property and equipment is reviewed for impairment pursuant to these provisions 
the carrying amount of an asset group is considered impaired if it exceeds the sum of our estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset group  excluding interest charges 
we regularly incur costs to develop potential projects or facilities and procure contracts for the design  permitting  construction and operations of facilities 
we recorded million in property and long term assets related to these activities at december   compared to million at december  we routinely review the status of each of these projects to determine if these costs are realizable 
if we are unsuccessful in obtaining the required permits  government approvals  or fulfilling the contract requirements  these costs will be expensed 
goodwill goodwill attributable to our reporting units is tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value 
significant estimates used in the determination of fair value include estimates of future cash flows  future growth rates  costs of capital and estimates of market multiples 
as required under current accounting standards  we test for impairment annually at year end unless factors become known that impairment may have occurred prior to year end 
purchase accounting we estimate the fair value of assets  including property  machinery and equipment and its related useful lives and salvage values  and liabilities when allocating the purchase price of an acquisition to the acquired assets and liabilities 
income taxes we assume the deductibility of certain costs in our income tax filings and estimate the recovery of deferred income tax assets 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the activity underlying these assets become deductible 
we consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
if actual future taxable income differs from our estimates  we may not realize deferred tax assets to the extent we have estimated 
legal and contingency accruals we estimate and accrue the amount of probable exposure we may have with respect to litigation  claims and assessments 
these estimates are based on management s assessment of the facts and the probabilities of the ultimate resolution of the litigation 
self insurance reserves we are substantially self insured for workers compensation  employers liability  auto liability  general liability and employee group health claims in view of the relatively high per incident deductibles we absorb under our insurance arrangements for these risks 
losses up to deductible amounts are estimated and accrued based upon known facts  historical trends  industry averages and actuarial assumptions regarding future claims development and claims incurred but not reported 
actual results could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions that we use in the preparation of our financial statements 
other we maintain two leases with an affiliate of one of our stockholders 
the first lease has an initial term through july   with an option to renew for an additional five year period 
rental payments made under this lease in totaled approximately million 
the second lease has an initial term through december  rental payments made under the second lease in totaled approximately million 
as of december   we had generated net operating loss nol carryforwards of approximately million available to reduce future income taxes 
these carryforwards begin to expire in a change in ownership  as defined by federal income tax regulations  could significantly limit our ability to utilize our carryforwards 
accordingly  our ability to utilize our nols to reduce future taxable income and tax liabilities may be limited 
additionally  because federal tax laws limit the time during which these carryforwards may be applied against future taxes  we may not be able to take full advantage of these attributes for federal income tax purposes 
we estimate that our effective tax rate in will approximate percent of pre tax income 
substantially all of our tax provision over the next several years is expected to be deferred in nature due to significant tax deductions in excess of book deductions for goodwill and depreciation 
risk factors which may affect future results the fact that our financial statements included herein are unaudited could have material effects on our company and our shareholders  a re audit of those financial statements could identify items requiring restatement 
since we are unable to file three years of audited financial information in our annual report on form k as required under rules and of regulation s x  our reports filed under the securities exchange act of the exchange act will not be in full compliance with the requirements of the exchange act 
as a result  the effectiveness of our registration statement on form s will be suspended  and we will be unable to issue shares under our stock option plans and agreements 
during any period when we are not current in our sec reports  neither our affiliates nor any person that purchased shares from us in a private offering during the preceding two years will be able to sell their shares in public markets pursuant to rule under the securities act of federal wastewater treatment and biosolid regulations may restrict our operations or increase our costs of operations 
federal wastewater treatment and wastewater residuals laws and regulations impose substantial costs on us and affect our business in many ways 
if we are not able to comply with the governmental regulations and requirements that apply to our operations  we could be subject to fines and penalties  and we may be required to spend large amounts to bring operations into compliance or to temporarily or permanently stop operations that are not permitted under the law 
those costs or actions could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
federal environmental authorities regulate the activities of the municipal and industrial wastewater generators and enforce standards for the discharge from wastewater treatment plants effluent wastewater with permits issued under the authority of the clean water act  as amended 
the treatment of wastewater produces an effluent and wastewater solids 
the treatment of these solids produces biosolids 
the part regulations regulate the use and disposal of biosolids and wastewater residuals and establish use and disposal standards for biosolids and wastewater residuals that are applicable to publicly and privately owned wastewater treatment plants in the united states 
biosolids may be surface disposed in landfills  incinerated  or applied to land for beneficial use in accordance with the requirements established by the regulations 
to the extent demand for our wastewater residuals treatment methods is created by the need to comply with the environmental laws and regulations  any modification of the standards created by such laws and regulations  or in their enforcement  may reduce the demand for our wastewater residuals treatment methods 
changes in these laws or regulations and or changes in the enforcement of these laws or regulations may also adversely affect our operations by imposing additional regulatory compliance costs on us  and requiring the modification of and or adversely affecting the market for our wastewater residuals management services 
we are subject to extensive and increasingly strict federal  state and local environmental regulation and permitting 
our operations are subject to increasingly strict environmental laws and regulations  including laws and regulations governing the emission  discharge  disposal and transportation of certain substances and related odor 
wastewater treatment plants and other plants at which our biosolids management services may be implemented are usually required to have permits  registrations and or approvals from state and or local governments for the operation of such facilities 
some of our facilities require air  wastewater  storm water  composting  use or siting permits  registrations or approvals 
we may not be able to maintain or renew our current permits  registrations or licensing agreements or to obtain new permits  registrations or licensing agreements  including for the land application of biosolids when necessary 
the process of obtaining a required permit  registration or license agreement can be lengthy and expensive 
we may not be able to meet applicable regulatory or permit requirements  and therefore may be subject to related legal or judicial proceedings 
many states  municipalities and counties have regulations  guidelines or ordinances covering the land application of biosolids  many of which set either a maximum allowable concentration or maximum pollutant loading rate for at least one pollutant 
the part regulations also require certain monitoring to ensure that certain pollutants or pathogens are below thresholds 
the epa has considered increasing these thresholds or adding new thresholds for different substances  which could increase our compliance costs 
in addition  some states have established management practices for land application of biosolids 
some members of congress  some state or local authorities  and some private parties  have sought to prohibit or limit the land application  agricultural use  thermal processing or composting of biosolids 
in states where we currently conduct business  certain counties and municipalities have banned the land application of class b biosolids 
other states and local authorities are reviewing their current regulations relative to land application of biosolids 
there can be no assurances that prohibition or limitation efforts will not be successful and have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  many states enforce landfill restrictions for nonhazardous biosolids and some states have site restrictions or other management practices governing lands 
these regulations typically require a permit to use biosolid products including incineration ash as landfill daily cover material or for disposal in the landfill 
it is possible that landfill operators will not be able to obtain or maintain such required permits 
any of the permits  registrations or approvals noted above  or related applications may be subject to denial  revocation or modification  or challenge by a third party  under various circumstances 
in addition  if new environmental legislation or regulations are enacted or existing legislation or regulations are amended or are enforced differently  we may be required to obtain additional  or modify existing  operating permits  registrations or approvals 
maintaining  modifying or renewing our current permits  registrations or licensing agreements or obtaining new permits  registrations or licensing agreements after new environmental legislation or regulations are enacted or existing legislation or regulations are amended or enforced differently may be subject to public opposition or challenge 
much of this public opposition and challenge  as well as related complaints  relates to odor issues  even when we are in compliance with odor requirements and even though we have worked hard to minimize odor from our operations 
public misperceptions about our business and any related odor could influence the governmental process for issuing such permits  registrations and licensing agreements or for responding to any such public opposition or challenge 
community groups could pressure local municipalities or state governments to implement laws and regulations which could increase our costs of our operations 
we are affected by unusually adverse weather and winter conditions 
our business is adversely affected by unusual weather conditions and unseasonably heavy rainfall  which can temporarily reduce the availability of land application sites in close proximity to our business upon which biosolids can be beneficially reused and applied to crop land 
material must be transported to either a permitted storage facility if available or to a local landfill for disposal 
in either case  this results in additional costs for disposal of the biosolids material 
in addition  our revenues and operational results are adversely affected during the winter months when the ground freezes thus limiting the level of land application that can be performed 
long periods of inclement weather could reduce our revenues and operational results causing a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 
our ability to grow may be limited by direct or indirect competition with other businesses that provide some or all of the same services that we provide 
we provide a variety of services relating to the transportation and treatment of wastewater residuals 
we are in direct and indirect competition with other businesses that provide some or all of the same services including small local companies  regional residuals management companies  and national and international water and wastewater operations privatization companies  technology suppliers  municipal solid waste companies  farming operations and  most significantly  municipalities and industries who choose not to outsource their residuals management needs 
some of these competitors are larger  more firmly established and have greater capital resources than we have 
we derive a substantial portion of our revenue from services provided under municipal contracts 
many of these will be subject to competitive bidding at some time in the future 
we also intend to bid on additional municipal contracts 
however  we may not be the successful bidder 
in addition  some of our contracts will expire in the near future and those contracts may be renewed on less attractive terms 
if we are not able to replace revenues from contracts lost through competitive bidding or from the renegotiation of existing contracts with other revenues within a reasonable time period  the lost revenue could have a material and adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our customer contracts may be terminated prior to the expiration of their term 
a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from services provided under contracts and written agreements with our customers 
some of these contracts  especially those contracts with large municipalities including our largest contract and at least four of our other top ten customers  provide for termination of the contract by the customer after giving relative short notice in some cases as little as ten days 
in addition  some of these contracts contain liquidated damages clauses  which may or may not be enforceable in the event of early termination of the contracts 
if one or more of these contracts are terminated prior to the expiration of its term  and we are not able to replace revenues from the terminated contract or receive liquidated damages pursuant to the terms of the contract  the lost revenue could have a material and adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operation 
a significant amount of our business comes from a limited number of customers and our revenue and profits could decrease significantly if we lost one or more of them as customers 
our business depends on our ability to provide services to our customers 
one or more of these customers may stop buying services from us or may substantially reduce the amount of services we provide them 
any cancellation  deferral or significant reduction in the services we provide these principal customers or a significant number of smaller customers could seriously harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
for the year ended december   our single largest customer accounted for percent of our revenues and our top ten customers accounted for approximately percent of our revenues 
we may not be able to obtain bonding required in connection with certain contracts on which we bid 
consistent with industry practice  we are required to post performance bonds in connection with certain contracts on which we bid 
in addition  we are often required to post both performance and payment bonds at the time of execution of contracts for commercial  federal  state and municipal projects 
the amount of bonding capacity offered by sureties is a function of the financial health of the entity requesting the bonding 
although we could issue letters of credit under our credit facility for bonding purposes  if we are unable to obtain bonding in sufficient amounts we may be ineligible to bid or negotiate on projects 
as of march   we had a bonding capacity of approximately million with approximately million utilized as of that date 
we always face the risk of liability and insufficient insurance 
we carry million of liability insurance including umbrella coverage  and under a separate policy  million of aggregate pollution and legal liability insurance million each loss subject to retroactive dates  which we consider sufficient to meet regulatory and customer requirements and to protect our employees  assets and operations 
it is possible that we will not be able to maintain such insurance coverage in the future 
further  we could face personal injury  third party or environmental claims or other damages resulting in substantial liability for which we are uninsured and which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our insurance programs utilize large deductible self insured retention plans offered by a commercial insurance company 
large deductible self insured retention plans allow us the benefits of cost effective risk financing while protecting us from catastrophic risk with specific stop loss insurance limiting the amount of self funded exposure for any one loss 
we are dependent on the availability and satisfactory performance of subcontractors for our design and build operations 
we participate in design and build construction operations usually as a general contractor 
virtually all design and construction work is performed by unaffiliated third party subcontractors 
as a consequence  we are dependent upon the continued availability of and satisfactory performance by these subcontractors for the design and construction of our facilities 
the insufficient availability of and unsatisfactory performance by these unaffiliated third party subcontractors could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
further  as the general contractor  we are legally responsible for the performance of our contracts and if such contracts are underperformed or nonperformed by our subcontractors  we could be financially responsible 
although our contracts with our subcontractors provide for indemnification if our subcontractors do not satisfactorily perform their contract  such indemnification may not cover our financial losses in attempting to fulfill the contractual obligations 
fluctuations in fuel costs could increase our operating expenses and negatively impact our net income 
the price and supply of fuel is unpredictable and fluctuates based on events outside our control  including geopolitical developments  supply and demand for oil and gas  actions by opec and other oil and gas producers  war and unrest in oil producing countries  regional production patterns and environmental concerns 
because fuel is needed to run the fleet of trucks that service our customers  our incinerators  our dryers and other facilities  price escalations or reductions in the supply of fuel could increase our operating expenses and have a negative impact on net income 
in the past  we have implemented a fuel surcharge to offset increased fuel costs 
however  we are not always able to pass through all or part of the increased fuel costs due to the terms of certain customers contracts and the inability to negotiate such pass through costs in a timely manner 
we are not able to guarantee that our estimated remaining contract value  which we call backlog  will result in actual revenues in any particular fiscal period 
any of the contracts included in our backlog  or estimated remaining contract value  presented herein may not result in actual revenues in any particular period or the actual revenues from such contracts may not equal our backlog 
in determining backlog  we calculate the expected payments remaining under the current terms of our contracts  assuming the renewal of contracts in accordance with their renewal provisions  no increase in the level of services during the remaining term  and estimated adjustments for changes in the consumer price index for contracts that contain price indexing 
however  it is possible that not all of our backlog will be recognized as revenue or earnings 
if we lose the pending lawsuits we are currently involved in  we could be liable for significant damages and legal expenses 
in the ordinary course of business  we may become involved in various legal and administrative proceedings  including some related to our permits  to land use or to environmental laws and regulations 
we are currently subject to several lawsuits relating to our business 
our defense to these claims or any other claims against us may not be successful 
if we lose these or future lawsuits  we may have to pay significant damages and legal expenses  and we could be subject to injunctions  court orders  loss of revenues and defaults under our credit and other agreements 
in addition  we may be subject to future lawsuits or legal proceedings 
these claims  even if they are without merit  could be expensive and time consuming to defend and if we were to lose any future cases we could be subject to injunctions and damages that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position and results of operations 
we could face considerable business and financial risk in implementing our acquisition strategy 
as part of our growth strategy  we intend to consider acquiring complementary businesses 
we regularly engage in discussions with respect to possible acquisitions 
future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities  which could have a material adverse effect upon our business  financial position and results of operations 
risks we could face with respect to acquisitions include difficulties in the integration of the operations  technologies  products and personnel of the acquired company  potential loss of employees  diversion of management s attention away from other business concerns  expenses of any undisclosed or potential legal liabilities of the acquired company  and risks of entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience 
in addition  it is possible that we will not be successful in consummating future acquisitions on favorable terms or at all 
we are dependent on our senior management for their depth of industry experience and knowledge 
we are highly dependent on the services of our senior management team 
our senior management team has been in the industry for many years and has substantial industry knowledge and contacts 
if a member of our senior management team were to terminate his association with us  we could lose valuable human capital  adversely affecting our business 
we currently do not maintain key man insurance on any member of our senior management team 
we generally enter into employment agreements with members of our senior management team  which contain noncompete and other provisions 
the laws of each state differ concerning the enforceability of noncompetition agreements 
state courts will examine all of the facts and circumstances at the time a party seeks to enforce a noncompete covenant 
we cannot predict with certainty whether or not a court will enforce a noncompete covenant in any given situation based on the facts and circumstances at that time 
if one of our key executive officers were to leave us and the courts refused to enforce the noncompete covenant  we might be subject to increased competition  which could have a material and adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
efforts by labor unions to organize our employees could divert management attention and increase our operating expenses 
in the past  labor unions have made attempts to organize our employees  and these efforts may continue in the future 
certain groups of our employees have chosen to be represented by unions  and we have negotiated collective bargaining agreements with some of the groups 
we cannot predict which  if any  groups of employees may seek union representation in the future or the outcome of collective bargaining 
the negotiation of these agreements could divert management attention and result in increased operating expenses and lower net income 
if we are unable to negotiate acceptable collective bargaining agreements  we might have to wait through cooling off periods  which are often followed by union initiated work stoppages  including strikes 
depending on the type and duration of such work stoppage  our operating expenses could increase significantly 
we may become subject to cercla 
cercla generally imposes strict joint and several liability for cleanup costs upon present owners and operators of facilities at which hazardous substances were disposed  past owners and operators at the time of disposal  generators of hazardous substances that were disposed at such facilities  and parties who arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances at such facilities 
the costs of a cercla cleanup can be very expensive 
given the difficulty of obtaining insurance for environmental impairment liability  such liability could have a material impact on our business and financial condition 
cercla section liability extends to cleanup costs necessitated by a release or threat of release of a hazardous substance 
the definition of release under cercla excludes the normal application of fertilizer 
the epa regards the land application of biosolids that meet the part regulations as a normal application of fertilizer  and thus not subject to cercla 
however  if we were to transport or handle biosolids that contain hazardous substances in violation of the part regulations  we could be liable under cercla 
from time to time  we generate hazardous substances which we dispose at landfills or we transport soils or other materials which may contain hazardous substances to landfills 
we also send residuals and ash from our incinerators to landfills for use as daily cover over the landfill 
liability under cercla  or comparable state statutes  can be founded on the disposal  or arrangement for disposal  of hazardous substances at sites such as landfills and for the transporting of such substances to landfills 
under cercla  or comparable state statutes  we may be liable for the remediation of a disposal site that was never owned or operated by us if the site contains hazardous substances that we generated or transported to such site 
we could also be responsible for hazardous substances during actual transportation and may be liable for environmental response measures arising out of disposal at a third party site with whom we had contracted 
in addition  under cercla  or comparable state statutes  we could be required to clean any of our current or former properties if hazardous substances are released or are otherwise found to be present 
we are currently monitoring the remediation of soil and groundwater at one of our properties in cooperation with the applicable state regulatory authority  but do not believe any additional material expenditures will be required 
however  there can be no assurance that currently unknown contamination would not be found on this or other properties 
our intellectual property may be misappropriated or subject to claims of infringement 
we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent  trademark  and trade secret laws  as well as licensing agreements 
our failure to obtain or maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property rights for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our competitors  many of whom have substantially greater resources and have made substantial investments in competing technologies  may have applied for or obtained  or may in the future apply for and obtain  patents that will prevent  limit or otherwise interfere with our ability to offer our services 
we have not conducted an independent review of patents issued to third parties 
we also rely on unpatented proprietary technology 
it is possible that others will independently develop the same or similar technology or otherwise obtain access to our unpatented technology 
to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information  we require employees  consultants  advisors and collaborators to enter into confidentiality agreements 
we cannot be assured that these agreements will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets  know how or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use  misappropriation or disclosure of such trade secrets  know how or other proprietary information 
if we are unable to maintain the proprietary nature of our technologies  we could be materially adversely affected 
if we determine that our goodwill is impaired  we may have to write off all or part of it 
goodwill represents the aggregate purchase price paid by us in acquisitions accounted for as a purchase over the fair value of the net assets acquired 
under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 we no longer amortize goodwill  but review annually for impairment 
in the event that facts and circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired  an evaluation of recoverability would be performed 
if a write down to market value of all or part of our goodwill becomes necessary  our accounting results and net worth would be adversely affected 
as of december   our total goodwill  net of amortization  was approximately million 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we utilize financial instruments  which inherently have some degree of market risk due to interest rate fluctuations 
management is actively involved in monitoring exposure to market risk and continues to develop and utilize appropriate risk management techniques 
we are not exposed to any other significant market risks  including commodity price risk  foreign currency exchange risk or interest rate risks from the use of derivative financial instruments 
management does not currently use derivative financial instruments for trading or to speculate on changes in interest rates or commodity prices 
derivatives and hedging activities on july   we entered into two interest rate swap transactions with two financial institutions to hedge our exposure to changes in the fair value on million of our million percent senior subordinated notes due the notes 
the purpose of these transactions was to convert future interest due on million of the notes to a lower variable rate in an attempt to realize savings on our future interest payments 
the terms of the interest rate swap contract and the underlying debt instruments are identical 
we designated these swap agreements as fair value hedges 
the swaps have notional amounts of million and million and mature in april to mirror the maturity of the notes 
under the agreements  we pay on a semi annual basis each april and october a floating rate based on a six month us dollar libor rate  plus a spread  and receives a fixed rate interest of percent 
during  we recorded interest savings related to these interest rate swaps of million  which served to reduce interest expense 
the million fair value of these derivative instruments is included in other long term liabilities as of december  the carrying value of our notes was decreased by the same amount 
on june   we entered into a reverse swap on our percent subordinated debt and used the proceeds from the reverse swap agreement to retire previously outstanding floating to fixed interest rate swap agreements the retired swaps and option agreements 
accordingly  the balance included in accumulated other comprehensive loss included in stockholders equity related to the retired swaps is being recognized in future periods income over the remaining term of the original swap agreement 
the amount of accumulated other comprehensive income recognized for the year ended december was approximately million 
the percent subordinated debt was repaid on april   with the proceeds from the sale of the notes 
accordingly  we discontinued using hedge accounting for the reverse swap agreement on april  from april   through june   the fair value of this fixed to floating reverse swap decreased by million 
this million mark to market gain was included in other income in the second quarter of financial statements 
on june   we entered into a floating to fixed interest rate swap agreement that substantially offsets market value changes in our reverse swap agreement 
the liability related to this reverse swap agreement and the floating to fixed offset agreement totaling approximately million is reflected in other long term liabilities at december  the loss recognized during the year ended december   related to the floating to fixed interest rate swap agreement was approximately million  while the gain recognized related to the reverse swap agreement was approximately million 
the amount of the ineffectiveness of the reverse swap agreement charged to other expense was approximately million for the year ended december  interest rate risk total debt at december   included approximately million in floating rate debt attributed to the senior credit agreement at a base interest rate plus percent  or approximately percent at december  we also have interest rate swaps outstanding on our fixed rate debt 
as a result  our interest costs in will fluctuate based on short term interest rates 
the impact on annual cash flow of a ten percent change in the floating rate ie libor would be approximately million
