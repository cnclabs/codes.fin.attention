business overview ceva licenses to semiconductor companies and electronic equipment manufacturers digital signal processor dsp cores and related ip solutions that enable a wide variety of electronic devices  including wireless and handheld devices  consumer electronics products  gps devices  consumer audio products and automotive applications 
during the fourth quarter of  we implemented a strategic re alignment of our operations in order to better focus on our key strengths dsp cores and integrated application ip technologies 
we also introduced our newest dsp core  the ceva x  with an architecture that we believe achieves new levels of performance  power efficiency and scalability that we believe will enable us to capture an increased share of the licensed dsp cores market 
we licensed ceva x to a leading handset manufacturer and a leading semiconductor company during the quarter 
in connection with our business re alignment  we ceased producing and selling chips embodying our technology  which we refer to as hard ip manufacturing  and certain non strategic technology areas 
we incurred a reorganization  restructuring and severance charge of approximately million and a non cash asset impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter 
we had cash outflow of approximately million in the fourth quarter in relation to restructuring and reorganization costs  in  we expect a cash outflow of approximately million in respect of restructuring and reorganization costs accrued at december  we believe that as a result of these steps we will be better positioned to exploit our strengths in dsp technology 
our strategy is to engage in licensing and royalty agreements with leading semiconductor manufacturers and oems that have a track record of successful adoption and deployment of key next generation technologies 
in addition  we derive a portion of our revenues from services  which include support and maintenance as well as design and deployment consulting 
contractual terms although the precise terms of our license agreements vary from licensee to licensee  they generally require payment of an initial license fee and ongoing per unit royalties 
under the terms of these license agreements  we may also provide integration services and support and maintenance to help accelerate the customer s product development cycle 
key features of these arrangements include initial license fees 
initial license fees are typically non refundable and are generally paid in installments either upon delivery of our ip or upon reaching defined development milestones where customization of our ip is required 
our licenses are typically perpetual in duration 
some of our licenses have extended payments beyond months  such agreements would typically have terms of to months 

table of contents royalties 
a per unit royalty is paid for each product incorporating our intellectual property that is sold  supplied or distributed by the licensee 
these royalties are calculated either as a percentage of the licensee s sale price per product or as a fixed amount per unit sold 
we generally give volume pricing to our licensees  and our per unit royalty rate under a license will decrease as more products incorporating our intellectual property are shipped 
as products incorporating our technology are brought to market  we expect revenue from royalties to increase 
we have no control  however  over when our customers will ultimately bring such products to market 
some of our licenses include prepaid royalties  in which a customer pays the royalties on a certain minimum number of products at the time we sign the license  which are typically non refundable 
support and maintenance 
we generally require licensees to pay a quarterly support and maintenance fee for a minimum of one year 
after that mandatory period  the customer may extend the support and maintenance agreement on an annual basis 
we seek to leverage our substantial investment to date in research and development and to utilize our experienced r d staff to enhance our technology offerings and to drive future revenue growth by offering cutting edge solutions 
we also anticipate that  as the global economy in general and the consumer electronics industry in particular recover  we will realize increased royalty revenues  which will incrementally increase our profit margins 
corporate background ceva was formed through a spin off of the dsp cores licensing business of dsp group and its combination with parthus technologies in november at that time  dsp group contributed the dsp cores licensing business to ceva  which was then its wholly owned subsidiary  dsp group distributed all of the existing common stock of ceva to the stockholders of dsp group  and ceva immediately thereafter combined with parthus technologies 
these transactions are described in detail in the report on form k of ceva dated november   as amended 
with respect to periods prior to november  the discussion below assumes that the separation of the dsp cores licensing business from dsp group had been in effect throughout the relevant periods 
our financial statements for such periods show the dsp cores licensing business as an entity carved out from the consolidated financial statements of dsp group using the historical results of operations and historical bases of assets and liabilities of this business  as described in note to our financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
this information may not reflect what our financial position or results of operations actually would have been had we operated as a separate  stand alone entity for such periods  and may not be indicative of our future financial position or results of operations 
this discussion includes the results of the business of parthus only for the period following the combination in november 
table of contents results of operations the following table presents line items from our statement of operations as percentages of our total revenues for the periods indicated consolidated statement of operations data revenues licensing and royalties other revenue total revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development  net sales and marketing general and administrative amortization of other intangible assets in process research and development charge reorganization  restructuring and severance charge impairment of assets total operating expenses income loss from operations other income expense  net income loss before taxes provision for income taxes net income loss 
table of contents discussion and analysis below we provide information on the significant line items in our statement of operations for each of the past three fiscal years  including the percentage changes year on year  as well as an analysis of the principal drivers in these line items from year to year 
revenues total revenues total revenues in millions change year on year the increase in total revenues from to reflected both increased licensing and royalty revenue and a full year of revenues from our design and consulting services and our hard ip manufacturing product line following the combination with parthus in november we ceased our hard ip manufacturing product line and certain non strategic technology areas in the fourth quarter of as part of our strategic realignment  we had recorded approximately million in revenue quarterly from these products in recent periods 
the decrease in total revenues from to was due in large part to the slowdown in the global economy  which resulted in delays in licensing decisions on a number of potentially significant deals towards the end of  offset by the added revenue derived from the parthus business following our combination with that company in november revenue from one customer accounted for of total revenues in revenues from two customers accounted for and of total revenues in revenues from three customers accounted for  and of total revenues in because of the nature of our license agreements and the associated large initial payments due  the identity of major customers generally varies from quarter to quarter 
licensing and royalty revenues licensing and royalty revenues in millions change year on year of which licensing revenues in millions change year on year 
table of contents royalty revenues in millions change year on year the increase in licensing revenues from to reflected increased revenues from our dsp cores and integrated application technologies reflecting the full year sales activity of the combined ceva and parthus businesses 
the decrease in licensing revenues from to was a result of the severe downturn and challenging market conditions in the semiconductor industry and the slowdown in the wireless and cellular market 
licensing and royalty revenues accounted for of our total revenues in  compared with and of total revenues in and  respectively 
the increase in unit royalty revenues from to reflects increased unit shipments of our ceva teak core by licensees in g cellular and dvd servo product areas  offset to some extent by a decrease in the unit shipments of lower royalty generating end of life g products 
the decrease in unit royalty revenues from to was primarily due to delays in licensing decisions on a number of significant deals and lower per unit royalties from some license agreements due to volume pricing 
we had royalty paying licensees in  in and in royalty generating licensees reported sales of million chips incorporating our technology in  compared with million in and million in the decrease in units shipped in reflects the reduction of shipments of g products in by one customer as it transitioned to g products  offset to some extent by increased unit shipments of g  cellular and dvd servo products by other customers 
three royalty generating licensees accounted for  and of total unit royalty revenues in two royalty generating licensees accounted for and of total unit royalty revenues in five royalty generating licensees shipped in excess of million units in other revenues other revenues in millions change year on year the increase in other revenues from to was primarily due to revenues generated in design and consulting services and hard ip manufacturing of million reflecting the full year sales activity of the combined ceva and parthus businesses 
the increase in other revenues from to was primarily due to revenues generated in design and consulting services and hard ip manufacturing of  following the combination with parthus  offset by a decrease in support and maintenance revenues of  the decrease in support and maintenance revenues reflected fewer support and related services to our dsp cores licensees in as a result of the slowdown in the global wireless and cellular markets 

table of contents geographic revenue analysis in millions  except percentages united states europe  middle east  africa asia revenues increased in absolute terms in all regions from to  reflecting greater sales activity and penetration in all markets 
the percentage increase in revenues from the united states reflects our increased sales focus on that market during the period 
we relocated our executive team  including our vp of sales  to our san jose headquarters  which has given us a greater sales presence in the country and which we anticipate will support a continued increase in overall revenues in the united states 
cost of revenues cost of revenues in millions change year on year cost of revenues accounted for of total revenues in  compared with in and in the absolute increase in cost of revenues in reflected increased revenues and in reflected the change in revenue mix following the combination with parthus  the increase in cost of revenues as a percentage of total revenues was primarily due to a decrease in the portion of revenues derived from higher gross margin royalties 
cost of revenues includes related labor costs and  where applicable  travel  related overhead and material costs 
operating expenses total operating expenses in millions change year on year the increase in total operating expenses from to reflects increased research and development  sales and marketing and general and administrative costs  which amounted to million compared with million in the increase in these costs was a result of higher average numbers of staff  facility costs and depreciation charges together with additional sales and marketing and administrative costs throughout following the combination with parthus 

table of contents reorganization  restructuring and severance charges totaled million in and million in these charges in resulted from the transition of our executive management team to san jose  severance costs and employee related liabilities  and provision for underutilized building operating lease obligations in connection with the re alignment of our business in the fourth quarter 
amortization charges were million in and million in  reflecting the intangibles acquired in the combination with parthus 
there was a non cash charge for impairment of assets of million in and a non cash charge of million in connection with the write off of in process research and development expenses in the increase in total operating expenses from to principally reflects one time non cash charges of million relating to in process research and development  million of which arose in connection with the combination with parthus and million of which arose in connection with an acquisition of wireless design technology in the fourth quarter of in addition  we incurred a restructuring charge of million representing primarily severance costs and provision for underutilized building operating lease obligations following a headcount reduction in november we also continued our investment  internally and by acquisition  in developing and licensing a strong technology portfolio 
the investment has resulted in higher numbers of engineering staff  facility costs and depreciation charges together with additional sales and marketing and administrative costs required to support our investments following the combination with parthus 
research and development expenses  net research and development expenses  net in millions change year on year research and development expenses  net of related government grants  increased to million in from million in and million in this increased cost primarily reflects higher labor and associated costs resulting from increased average headcount and increased investment in design tools and sub contract design throughout and late following the combination with parthus in november research and development expenses  net of related government grants  were of total revenues in  compared with in and in we recorded research grants from the magnet programs of the chief scientist of israel and under the rti funding program of enterprise ireland of million in compared with  in and  in grants received from the chief scientist of israel may become refundable if certain revenues are achieved for products developed under the magnet programs 
the average number of research and development personnel in was  compared with in the number of research and development personnel was at december   compared with at year end and at year end research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and associated costs connected with the development of our intellectual property 
because technological feasibility is generally not established until all design  coding and testing activities are completed  we expense all development costs as incurred 
work that we perform to develop technology for customers on a fee for services basis is not included in research and development expenses  nevertheless  we generally retain the right to use intellectual property developed in this manner 
research and development expenses include payments that we make to third parties to license technology from them when we incorporate their technology into our intellectual property as part of our research and development activities 
research and development expenses are net of related government research grants 
we view research and development as a principal strategic investment and have continued our commitment to invest heavily in this area  which represents the largest of our ongoing operating expenses 

table of contents sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses in millions change year on year the increase in sales and marketing expenses from to was primarily due to an increase in the number of sales and marketing personnel throughout and the later part of to support our increased sales and marketing efforts following the combination with parthus 
the average number of sales and marketing personnel in was compared with in the total number of sales and marketing personnel was at december   compared with at year end and at year end sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenues were in  compared with in and in the percentage movement reflects the increase in revenue in compared with and the decrease in revenue in compared with sales and marketing expenses consist of salaries  commissions  travel and other costs associated with sales and marketing activity  as well as advertising  trade show participation  public relations and other marketing costs 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses in millions change year on year the increase in absolute terms reflects our commitment to investing in a management and administrative structure to support our business going forward and increased facility costs throughout and the later part of following our combination with parthus 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  information systems and technology infrastructure  facilities costs  finance and human resources related costs  and depreciation 
the average number of general and administrative personnel throughout was compared with in the total number of general and administrative personnel was at december   compared with at year end and at year end 
table of contents amortization of intangibles amortization of other intangible assets in millions change year on year the charges identified above were incurred in connection with the amortization of intangible assets acquired in the combination with parthus 
as of december  and  the amount of other intangible assets was and million  respectively 
we anticipate ongoing expense in connection with the amortization of remaining intangibles of approximately  per quarter 
in process research and development in process research and development charge in millions the in process research and development charge in represented one time non cash charges of million arising in connection with the combination with parthus and million relating to certain wireless design technology which had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
both these amounts were expensed in the fourth quarter of the projects to develop these technologies were abandoned in reorganization  restructuring and severance charge our management and board of directors approved reorganization and restructuring plans in  which resulted in a total charge of million 
in the first  third and fourth quarters of  we recorded charges of million  million and million  respectively 
the charges arose in connection with senior executive management changes in connection with the implementation of our strategic initiative to strengthen our headquarters function in the us also included are severance charges and employee related liabilities arising in connection with a head count reduction of employees  underutilized building operating lease charges and a charge for redundant assets arising from a reduction in headcount and facility requirements 
the reduction in headcount and facility requirements is a result of the realignment of the business to focus on dsp cores and integrated application technologies and the decision to cease manufacturing our hard ip products and certain non strategic technology areas 
management was required to make certain estimates and assumptions in assessing the underutilized building operating lease charge arising from the reduction in facility requirements 
the underutilized building operating lease charge was calculated by taking into consideration the committed annual rental charge associated with the vacant square footage  an assessment of the sublet rents that could be achieved based on current market conditions  vacancy rates and future outlook  the estimated periods that facilities would be empty before being sublet  an assessment of the percentage increases in the primary lease rent and the sublease rent at each five year rent review  and the application of a discount rate of over the remaining period of the lease 

table of contents we incurred a restructuring charge of million following the rationalization of certain product lines in the fourth quarter of to enhance strategic focus and to further reduce costs 
this principally resulted in severance costs following a headcount reduction of employees and underutilized building operating lease charges arising from a reduction in our facility requirements 
impairment of assets we recorded an impairment charge of  in in respect of redundant assets  as well as an impairment charge of  in respect of certain technology acquired in the combination with parthus and the parthus name  which we abandoned as part of our corporate rebranding 
these charges related to the realignment of our business  including the decision to cease manufacturing hard ip products and certain non strategic technology areas 
in december  we also recognized an impairment charge of million in relation to a minority investment in a private company acquired on the combination with parthus 
management assessed the carrying value of the investment after taking into consideration the potential discounted projected future cash flows  the valuation derived from the most recent proposed private placement  the liquidity of the investment and the general market conditions in which this private company operates 
other income  net other income  net in millions change year on year of which interest income in millions change year on year foreign exchange loss in millions change year on year other income consists of interest earned on investments and foreign exchange losses 
the increase in interest earned in reflects higher cash balances held throughout compared with as a result of the cash contribution to ceva by dsp group in connection with the spin off from dsp group and the cash balances of parthus at the time of the combination 
the decrease in interest earned from to reflected the lower interest rate environment in  which impacted overall returns on cash and cash equivalents invested 
foreign exchange losses in and primarily reflect the impact of the appreciation of the euro against the us dollar on our euro liabilities 

table of contents provision for income taxes provision for income taxes in millions change year on year the reduction in the provision of income taxes in reflects losses incurred domestically and in certain foreign jurisdictions 
the reduction in the provision for income taxes from to reflects lower revenues and consequently lower taxable profits in compared with the provisions for income taxes for and for the first months of relate to periods during which we were a wholly owned subsidiary of dsp group 
liquidity and capital resources ceva became a stand alone business in november  when the separation and spin off of the dsp cores licensing business from dsp group and the combination with parthus were effected 
immediately prior to the separation and spin off  all of the year end available cash from the operations of the dsp cores licensing business was transferred to dsp group 
as part of the assets contributed to us in the separation  dsp group made a total net contribution to our company of million  including million in transaction expenses relating to the combination 
at the time of the combination  parthus technologies had net cash of million 
as of december   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents 
net cash used in operating activities in was million  compared with million of net cash used in operating activities in and million of net cash provided by operating activities in the net cash outflow from operating activities in included the settlement of merger related costs of approximately million following the combination with parthus and cash outflow in connection with restructuring and reorganization costs incurred in and the last quarter of amounting to approximately million 
the net cash outflow from operating activities in principally reflects the settlement arrangements contained in our combination agreement with parthus technologies  pursuant to which trade receivables and other accounts receivables and prepaid expenses together with income taxes payable prior to november  were settled by dsp group 
cash flows from operating activities may vary significantly from quarter to quarter depending on the timing of our receipts and payments 
of the million of restructuring and reorganization costs accrued at december   we expect a cash outflow of approximately million in  primarily relating to underutilized building rental payments and employee related costs  including the possible repayment of government grants related to employee numbers 
our ongoing cash outflows from operating activities principally relate to payroll related costs and obligations under our property leases and design tool licenses 
our primary sources of cash inflows are receipts from our debtors and interest earned from our cash holdings 
the timing of receipts from debtors is based upon the completion of agreed milestones or agreed dates as set out in the contracts 
in  we signed four license contracts with extended payment terms of between and months  generating revenue of  of which million is collectable in and  in cash acquired in connection with the separation from dsp group and on the acquisition of parthus has been used to fund working capital requirements  as well as property and equipment expenditures  which to date have been relatively low due to the fact that our licensing business model requires no manufacturing facilities 
capital equipment purchases of computer hardware and software used in engineering development  company 
table of contents vehicles  furniture and fixtures amounted to approximately million in   in  and million in the high level of capital expenditures in was principally due to investments in new design tools and tenant improvements associated with the move of our facility in israel to new premises 
proceeds from the sale of property and equipment amounted to  in compared with  in we had cash outflow of  for acquired technology in cash required for investments consisted of approximately million invested in november in the design and development of digital media solutions for both wireless infrastructures and computer product applications 
net cash provided by financing activities of  in reflects proceeds from the issuance of shares upon exercise of employee stock options and issuance of shares under our employee stock purchase plan 
net cash provided by financing activities of million in reflects the issuance of shares and capital return of million to dsp group as part of the combination with parthus on november  we believe that our current cash on hand  along with cash from operations  will provide sufficient capital to fund our operations for at least the next months 
we cannot assure you  however  that the underlying assumed levels of revenues and expenses will prove to be accurate 
contractual obligations the table below presents the principal categories of our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations leasehold properties operating lease obligations other purchase obligations total operating leasehold obligations principally relate to our offices in ireland  israel and the united states 
the most material of these obligations relates to the lease on our harcourt street offices in dublin  which involves a total commitment of million over the remaining years of the agreement 
a portion of this space is currently underutilized as a result of the re alignment of our business and related headcount reductions in  which is further discussed in note to our audited financial statements  which appear elsewhere in this annual report 
other operating lease obligations relate to license agreements entered into for maintenance of design tools of  and obligations under motor vehicle leases of million 
purchase obligations consist of capital commitments of  and operating purchase order commitments of  
table of contents critical accounting policies  estimates and assumptions our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
these accounting principles require us to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions 
we believe that the estimates  judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates  judgments and assumptions are made 
these estimates  judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
to the extent there are material differences between these estimates  judgments or assumptions and actual results  our financial statements will be affected 
the significant accounting policies that we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following revenue recognition allowances for doubtful accounts accounting for income taxes impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets reorganization  restructuring and severance charge revenue recognition significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the recognition of revenue in any accounting period 
material differences in the amount of revenue in any given period may result if these judgments or estimates prove to be incorrect or if management s estimates change on the basis of development of the business or market conditions 
management judgments and estimates have been applied consistently and have been reliable historically 
a portion of our revenue is derived from license agreements that entail the customization of our application ip to the customer s specific requirements 
revenues from initial license fees for such arrangements are recognized based on the percentage of completion method over the period from signing of the license through to customer acceptance  as such ip requires significant modification or customization that takes time to complete 
the percentage of completion is measured by monitoring progress using records of actual time incurred to date in the project compared with the total estimated project requirement  which corresponds to the costs related to earned revenues 
estimates of total project requirements are based on prior experience of customization  delivery and acceptance of the same or similar technology and are reviewed and updated regularly by management 
we believe that the use of the percentage of completion method is appropriate as we have the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the extent of progress towards completion  contract revenues and contract costs 
in addition  contracts executed include provisions that clearly specify the enforceable rights regarding services to be provided and received by the parties to the contracts  the consideration to be exchanged and the manner and terms of settlement 
in all cases we expect to perform our contractual obligations and our licensees are expected to satisfy their obligations under the contract 
the complexity of the estimation process and the issues related to the assumptions  risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of the percentage of completion method of accounting affect the amounts of revenue and related expenses reported in our consolidated financial statements 
a number of internal and external factors can affect our estimates  including labor rates  utilization and specification and testing requirement changes 

table of contents allowances for doubtful accounts we make judgments as to our ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances for the portion of receivables when collection becomes doubtful 
provisions are made based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding receivables 
in determining the provision  we analyze our historical collection experience and current economic trends 
if the historical data we use to calculate the allowance provided for doubtful accounts does not reflect the future ability to collect outstanding receivables  additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be needed and the future results of operations could be materially affected 
accounting for income taxes significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax expense provision 
in the ordinary course of a global business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of cost reimbursement arrangements among related entities  the process of identifying items of revenue and expense that qualify for preferential tax treatment and segregation of foreign and domestic income and expense to avoid double taxation 
although we believe that our estimates are reasonable  the final tax outcome of these matters may be different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
such differences could have a material effect on our income tax provision and net income loss in the period in which such determination is made 
goodwill under financial accounting standards board statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  sfas  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests based on estimated fair value in accordance with sfas in october  we completed our annual impairment test and assessed the carrying value of goodwill as required by sfas the goodwill impairment test compared the carrying value of the company the reporting unit with the fair value at that date 
because the market capitalization exceeded the carrying value significantly  no impairment arose 
no indicators of impairment were identified between the date of the annual impairment test and year end 
should our market capitalization decline  in assessing the recoverability of our goodwill  we may be required to make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
this process is subjective and requires judgment at many points throughout the analysis 
if our estimates or their related assumptions change in subsequent periods or if actual cash flows are below our estimates  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded 
other intangible assets other intangible assets are amortized to the statement of operations over the period during which benefits are expected to accrue  currently estimated at five years 
we recorded a million impairment charge in in respect of certain technology acquired in the combination with parthus  the parthus name  which we abandoned as part of our corporate rebranding  and steps connected with the realignment of our business  including the decision to cease hard ip manufacturing and certain non strategic technology areas 

table of contents the determination of the value of such intangible assets requires us to make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or the related assumptions change in the future  we could be required to record additional impairment charges 
reorganization  restructuring and severance charge in the first  third and fourth quarters of  we recorded reorganization  restructuring and severance charges of   and  respectively 
the charges arose in connection with the implementation of our strategic initiative to strengthen our headquarters function in the us  and the related resignations of our ireland based chief executive officer and chief financial officer and the resignations of our chairman and vice chairman from their executive management positions 
also included are severance charges for employees  underutilized building operating lease obligations and commitment charges and a charge for redundant assets arising from a reduction in headcount and facility requirements 
we were required to make certain estimates and assumptions in assessing the operating lease obligations arising from a reduction in facility requirements 
the underutilized building operating lease charge was calculated by taking into consideration the committed annual rental charge associated with the vacant square footage  an estimate of the sublet rents that could be achieved based on current market conditions  vacancy rates and future outlook  an estimate of the percentage increases in the head lease rent and the sublease rent at each five year rent review  and the application of a discount rate of over the remaining period of the lease 
if these estimates or the related assumptions change in the future  we could be required to record a reduction in or additional restructuring charges 
factors that could affect our operating results we caution you that the following important factors  among others  could cause our actual future results to differ materially from those expressed in forward looking statements made by or on behalf of us in filings with the securities and exchange commission  press releases  communications with investors and oral statements 
any or all of our forward looking statements in this annual report  and in any other public statements we make  may turn out to be wrong 
they can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties 
many factors mentioned in the discussion below will be important in determining future results 
we undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
you are advised  however  to consult any further disclosures we make in our reports filed with the securities and exchange commission 
risks relating to our markets the industries in which we license our technology have experienced a challenging period of slow growth that has negatively impacted and could continue to negatively impact our business and operating results 
the primary customers for our products are semiconductor design and manufacturing companies  system oems and electronic equipment manufacturers  particularly in the telecommunications field 
these industries are highly cyclical and have been subject to significant economic downturns at various times  particularly in recent periods 
these downturns are characterized by production overcapacity and reduced revenues  which at times may encourage semiconductor companies or electronic product manufacturers to reduce their expenditure on our technology 
during  the semiconductor industry as a whole experienced the most severe contraction in its history  with total semiconductor sales worldwide declining by more than  according to the semiconductor industry association 
the market for semiconductors used in mobile communications was 
table of contents particularly hard hit  with the overall decline in sales worldwide estimated by gartner dataquest to have been well above 
these adverse conditions stabilized but did not improve during the course of during the course of  a recovery appeared to begin 
if this apparent recovery is not sustained through and beyond  however  our business could be further materially and adversely affected 
the markets in which we operate are highly competitive  and as a result we could experience a loss of sales  lower prices and lower revenue 
the markets for the products in which our technology is used are highly competitive 
aggressive competition could result in substantial declines in the prices that we are able to charge for our intellectual property 
it could also cause our existing customers to move their orders to our competitors 
many of our competitors are large companies that have significantly greater financial and other resources than we have 
in addition  we may face increased competition from smaller  niche semiconductor design companies in the future 
some of our customers may also decide to satisfy their needs through in house design and production 
we compete on the basis of price  product quality  design cycle time  reliability  performance  customer support  name recognition and reputation  and financial strength 
our inability to compete effectively on these bases could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our operating results fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to a variety of factors  including our lengthy sales cycle  and are not a meaningful indicator of future performance 
in some quarters our operating results could be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors  which could cause our stock price to fall 
factors that may affect our quarterly results of operations in the future include  among other things the timing of the introduction of new or enhanced technologies  as well as the market acceptance of such technologies  new product announcements and introductions by competitors  the timing and volume of orders and production by our customers  as well as fluctuations in royalty revenues resulting from fluctuations in unit shipments by our licensees  our lengthy sales cycle the gain or loss of significant licensees  and changes in our pricing policies and those of our competitors 
we rely significantly on revenue derived from a limited number of licensees 
we expect that a limited number of licensees  varying in identity from period to period  will account for a substantial portion of our revenues in any period 
moreover  license agreements for our dsp cores have not historically provided for substantial ongoing license payments  although they may provide for royalties based on product shipments 
significant portions of our anticipated future revenue  therefore  will likely depend upon our success in attracting new customers or expanding our relationships with existing customers 
our ability to succeed in these efforts will depend on a variety of factors  including the performance  quality  breadth and depth of our current and future products and our sales and marketing skills 
our failure to obtain future customer licenses would impede our future revenue growth 

table of contents we depend on market acceptance of third party semiconductor intellectual property 
our future growth will depend on the level of acceptance by the market of our third party  licensable intellectual property model and the variety of intellectual property offerings available on the market  which to a large extent are not in our control 
if the market shifts and third party sip is no longer desired by our customers  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially harmed 
we depend on the success of our licensees to promote our solutions in the marketplace 
we do not sell our technology directly to end users  we license our technology primarily to semiconductor companies and to electronic equipment manufacturers  who then incorporate our technology into the products they sell 
because we do not control the business practices of our licensees  we do not influence the degree to which they promote our technology or set the prices at which they sell products incorporating our technology 
we cannot assure you that our licensees will devote satisfactory efforts to promote our solutions 
in addition  our unit royalties from licenses are totally dependent upon the success of our licensees in introducing products incorporating our technology and the success of those products in the marketplace 
if we do not retain our current licensees and continue to attract new licensees  our business may be harmed 
we depend on a limited number of key personnel who would be difficult to replace 
our success depends to a significant extent upon our key employees and senior management  the loss of the service of these employees could materially harm us 
competition for skilled employees in our field is intense 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in attracting and retaining the required personnel 
risks relating to political and economic developments our operations in israel may be adversely affected by instability in the middle east region 
one of our principal research and development facilities are located in  and some of our directors and executive officers are residents of  israel 
although substantially all of our sales currently are being made to customers outside israel  we are nonetheless directly influenced by the political  economic and military conditions affecting israel 
any major hostilities involving israel could significantly harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  certain of our officers and employees are currently obligated to perform annual reserve duty in the israel defense forces and are subject to being called for active military duty at any time 
although we have operated effectively under these requirements since our inception  we cannot predict the effect of these obligations on the company in the future 
our operations could be disrupted by the absence  for a significant period  of one or more of our officers or key employees due to military service 

table of contents risks relating to our separation from dsp group restrictions on our ability to take certain actions could inhibit our growth 
the agreement governing our separation from dsp group restricts us from liquidating  disposing of or discontinuing our dsp cores licensing business during the two year period following our spin off  which will end november  although we have no plans to take any such steps  such restrictions  as well as our agreement to indemnify dsp group if we do not comply with these restrictions  could limit our flexibility 
in addition  these restrictions and indemnification obligations could make us a less attractive acquisition or merger candidate during this period 
we could be subject to joint and several liability for taxes of dsp group 
as a former member of a group filing consolidated income tax returns with dsp group  we could be liable for federal income taxes of dsp group and other members of the consolidated group  including taxes  if any  incurred by dsp group on the distribution of our stock to the stockholders of dsp group 
dsp group has agreed to indemnify us against these taxes  other than taxes for which we have agreed to indemnify dsp group pursuant to the terms of the tax indemnification and allocation agreement and separation agreement we entered into with dsp group 
some of our directors and executive officers may have conflicts of interest because of their ownership of dsp group s common stock or position with dsp group 
some of our directors and executive officers  including eliyahu ayalon  who serves as the chairman of the board of directors of dsp group  gideon wertheizer  our executive vice president ceva dsp cores  and issachar ohana  our vice president  worldwide sales  hold a significant number of shares of dsp group s common stock and options to purchase shares of dsp group s common stock 
ownership of dsp group s common stock by certain of our directors and executive officers could create  or appear to create  conflicts of interest when they are faced with decisions that could have different implications for dsp group and us 
additional risks relating to our business our success will depend on our ability to manage our geographically dispersed operations successfully 
although we are headquartered in san jose  california  most of our employees are located in ireland and israel 
accordingly  our ability to compete successfully will depend in part on the ability of a limited number of key executives located in geographically dispersed offices to integrate management  address the needs of our customers and respond to changes in our markets 
if we are unable to effectively manage our remote operations  our business may be harmed 
we may not be successful in licensing integrated  system level solutions 
we offer our application ip built around our dsp cores  and continue to offer our dsp cores and application ip on a stand alone basis 
we have limited experience in offering dsp cores and application ip as an integrated solution 
future licenses for these integrated solutions may be on terms less favorable than we currently anticipate 

table of contents if we are unable to meet the changing needs of our end users or to address evolving market demands  our business may be harmed 
the markets for programmable dsp cores and application ip are characterized by rapidly changing technology  emerging markets and new and developing end user needs  requiring significant expenditure for research and development 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to introduce systems and solutions that reflect prevailing industry standards on a timely basis  to meet the specific technical requirements of our end users or to avoid significant losses due to rapid decreases in market prices of our products  and our failure to do so may seriously harm our business 
in addition  the reduction in the number of our employees in connection with our recent restructuring efforts could adversely affect our ability to attract or retain customers who require certain r d capabilities from their ip providers 
we may seek to expand our business through acquisitions that could result in diversion of resources and extra expenses 
we may pursue acquisitions of businesses  products and technologies  or establish joint venture arrangements in the future that could expand our business 
the negotiation of potential acquisitions or joint ventures  as well as the integration of acquired or jointly developed businesses  technologies or products could cause diversion of management s time and our resources 
we may not be able to successfully integrate acquired businesses or joint ventures with our operations 
if we were to make any acquisition or enter into a joint venture  we may not receive the intended benefits of the acquisition or joint venture 
if future acquisitions or joint ventures disrupt our operations  or if we have difficulty integrating the businesses or technologies we acquire  our business  financial condition and results of operations could suffer 
we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property 
our success and ability to compete depend in large part upon the protection of our proprietary technologies 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark  trade secret  mask work and other intellectual property rights  confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
these agreements and measures may not be sufficient to protect our technology from third party infringement  or to protect us from the claims of others 
as a result  we face risks associated with our patent position  including the potential need to engage in significant legal proceedings to enforce our patents  the possibility that the validity or enforceability of our patents may be denied  the possibility that third parties will be able to compete against us without infringing our patents and the possibility that our products may infringe patent rights of third parties 
our tradenames or trademarks may be registered or utilized by third parties in countries other than those in which we have registered them  impairing our ability to enter and compete in these markets 
if we were forced to change any of our brand names  we could lose a significant amount of our brand equity 
our business will suffer if we are sued for infringement of the intellectual property rights of third parties or if we cannot obtain licenses to these rights on commercially acceptable terms 
although we are not currently involved in any litigation  we are subject to the risk of adverse claims and litigation alleging infringement of the intellectual property rights of others 
there are a large number of patents held by others  including our competitors  pertaining to the broad areas in which we are active 
we have not  and cannot reasonably  investigate all such patents 
from time to time  we have become aware of patents in our technology areas and have sought legal counsel regarding the validity of such patents and their impact on how we operate our business  and we will continue to seek such counsel when appropriate in the future 
claims 
table of contents against us may require us to enter into license arrangements or result in protracted and costly litigation  regardless of the merits of these claims 
any necessary licenses may not be available or  if available  may not be obtainable on commercially reasonable terms 
if we cannot obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms  we may be forced to stop licensing our technology  and our business would be seriously harmed 
our business depends on oems and their suppliers obtaining required complementary components 
some of the raw materials  components and subassemblies included in the products manufactured by our oem customers are obtained from a limited group of suppliers 
supply disruptions  shortages or termination of any of these sources could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations due to the delay or discontinuance of orders for products containing our ip  especially our dsp cores  until those necessary components are available 
the future growth of our business depends in part on our ability to license to system oems and small to medium sized semiconductor companies directly and to expand our sales geographically 
historically a substantial portion of the revenues from the licensing of our products has been derived in any period from a relatively small number of licensees 
because of the substantial license fees we charge  our customers tend to be large semiconductor companies or vertically integrated system oems 
part of our current growth strategy is to broaden the adoption of our products by small to mid size companies by offering different versions of our products  targeted at these companies 
in addition we plan to continue expanding our sales to include additional geographies 
asia  in particular  is a region we have targeted for growth 
if we are unable to effectively develop and market our intellectual property through these models  our revenues will continue to be dependent on a smaller number of licensees and a less geographically dispersed pattern of licensees  which could harm our business and results of operations 
additional risks relating to our international operations the israeli tax benefits that we currently receive and the government programs in which we participate require us to meet certain conditions and may be terminated or reduced in the future  which could increase our costs 
we enjoy certain tax benefits in israel  particularly as a result of the approved enterprise status of our facilities and programs 
to maintain our eligibility for these tax benefits  we must continue to meet certain conditions  relating principally to adherence to the investment program filed with the investment center of the israeli ministry of industry and trade and to periodic reporting obligations 
we believe that we will be able to continue to meet such conditions 
should we fail to meet such conditions in the future  however  these benefits would be cancelled and we would be subject to corporate tax in israel at the standard rate of and could be required to refund tax benefits already received 
in addition  we cannot assure you that these grants and tax benefits will be continued in the future at their current levels or otherwise 
the termination or reduction of certain programs and tax benefits particularly benefits available to us as a result of the approved enterprise status of our facilities and programs or a requirement to refund tax benefits already received may seriously harm our business  operating results and financial condition 

table of contents our corporate tax rate may increase  which could adversely impact our cash flow  financial condition and results of operations 
we have significant operations in the republic of ireland and a substantial portion of our taxable income historically has been generated there 
currently  some of our irish subsidiaries are taxed at rates substantially lower than us tax rates 
although there is no expectation of any changes to irish tax law  if our irish subsidiaries were no longer to qualify for these lower tax rates or if the applicable tax laws were rescinded or changed  our operating results could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  because our irish and israeli operations are owned by subsidiaries of a us corporation  distributions to the us corporation  and in certain circumstances undistributed income of the subsidiaries  may be subject to us tax 
moreover  if us or other foreign tax authorities were to change applicable foreign tax laws or successfully challenge the manner in which our subsidiaries profits are currently recognized  our overall taxes could increase  and our business  cash flow  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk a majority of our revenues and a portion of our expenses are transacted in us dollars and our assets and liabilities together with our cash holdings are predominately denominated in us dollars 
however  the bulk of our expenses are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  principally the euro and the israeli nis 
increases in the volatility of the exchange rates of the euro and the nis versus the us dollar could have an adverse effect on the expenses and liabilities that we incur when translated into us dollars 
we incurred foreign exchange losses of approximately  in and  in  arising principally on euro liabilities as a result of the appreciation of the euro against the us dollar 
as a result of such currency fluctuations and the conversion to us dollars for financial reporting purposes  we may experience fluctuations in our operating results on an annual and a quarterly basis going forward 
we have not in the past  but may in the future  hedge against fluctuations in exchange rates 
future hedging transactions may not successfully mitigate losses caused by currency fluctuations 
we expect to continue to experience the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on an annual and quarterly basis  and currency fluctuations could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 
we review monthly our non us dollar denominated liabilities and look to hold equivalent non us dollar cash balances to mitigate losses caused by currency fluctuations 
we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates 
we typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our market exposures on our investment securities because the majority of our investments are short term 
we do not have any derivative instruments 
the fair value of our investment portfolio or related income would not be significantly impacted by either a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates due mainly to the short term nature of our investment portfolio 
all the potential changes noted above are based on sensitivity analysis performed on our balances as of december
