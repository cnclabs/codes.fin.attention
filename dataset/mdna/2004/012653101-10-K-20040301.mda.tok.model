overview and outlook as albemarle enters  the company is well positioned to further expand and diversify operations 
in  revenue increased by  up million  from  driven by our acquisitions  favorable foreign exchange movement  and the development and expansion of our base business 
this momentum is expected to continue in  however  the growth is expected to be moderated due to continued margin pressure and the maturation of selected products 
albemarle is in a strong financial position to capture new opportunities and further build our diversified global platform 
we expect to continue to strengthen our global platform through organic growth and acquisitions 
about of our sales originated from businesses we acquired within the past five years 
these acquisitions were strategically aligned to support our product portfolio and were accretive to earnings within a year 
we continue to look for acquisitions that meet our strategic and financial objectives 
during  we plan to provide resources to fuel the continuing research and development essential for growth 
new products developed within the past five years now account for almost of net sales  up from in this past success has prompted a re evaluation of our earlier goal of  which may be increased to of our portfolio by our research programs not only include development of new products  but also extend to the introduction of efficient process technology to support our manufacturing expertise 
our history in organometallic and bromine chemistry provides the foundation to serve new polymer  pharmaceutical and other product areas 
we expect new albemarle corporation and subsidiaries opportunities to result from the combination of our technical expertise coupled with our global marketing and distribution 
new developments include innovative bromine based products for use in water treatment  catalysts for the next generation of ultra thin  ultra clear  ultra strong polyolefin films and intermediates that support promising advances in drug delivery systems 
albemarle continues to grow geographically  expanding our footprint in key growth regions of the world through acquisitions  joint ventures  new distribution channels and other methods 
in asia we have recently formed and launched our trading company to support growth in china  and although our starting point is relatively low  we have seen an increase in chinese sales in versus further  we are in the process of starting up our joint venture polyolefins catalyst plant near shanghai 
in january of  we acquired a distribution and marketing company in korea  providing direct access to many important customers in the region 
it is our belief that sales into asia will grow at a faster rate than other parts of the world 
the search for growth across a wide front is critical 
in recent years  chemical industry earnings have been pinched between low demand caused by a worldwide economic slump and increasing raw material and energy prices 
for example  our raw material and energy costs were up over million compared to it is difficult to forecast the level and direction of pricing trends in raw materials and energy  but we do see a continued bias toward higher costs in these areas as the economic recovery continues 
the company frequently reviews the impact of key raw materials and energy costs on our business and reports on their impact  excluding any costs passed through to our customers 
ethylene increases of one cent per pound impact earnings per share eps by one and one half cents on an annual basis 
similarly  chlorine increases of per ton lower eps by two cents  and a change in the price of alumina trihydrate of per ton change eps by about seven cents 
natural gas increases of per million btus reduce earnings about cents per share  including the impact on electricity costs 
all of these costs are calculated before taxes 
for many years we have faced ever increasing competition from asian manufacturers 
this trend is expected to continue 
our margins have been affected by more aggressive global competition  and when this is combined with price pressures related to the slow economic recovery in the us manufacturing sector  it is easy to see the need for a relentless pursuit of cost control and innovation 
we have also experienced the loss of key customers for certain of our products 
albemarle will continue the systematic construction of a global  low cost portfolio based on new technology both internally developed and acquired and serving our customers well 
this is the key to our future performance as we seek to realign our activities to these global changes 
as we enter  the strength of the economy is one of the primary drivers of our business  particularly as it relates to growth in consumer electronics and construction  two important end use markets for polymer chemicals 
this business is also expected to be positively influenced by a combination of internal development  cost improvements and bolt on acquisitions 
we also are monitoring closely the financial and competitive impact of foreign exchange movements 
overall  the recent weakening of the united states dollar is positive for the company  but this volatility always has sequential ramifications  and the impact can change over time 
based on the sales mix  albemarle has calculated the impact on net sales of movement in exchange rates of the dollar against significant sales currencies for the company a movement of in the japanese yen will affect dollar sales figures by about  on an annual basis 
the european union s euro s fluctuation of against the dollar will change albemarle sales by about million on an annual basis 
fine chemicals our fine chemicals business is expected to be influenced by many of the same factors in as in  raw material and energy cost issues and the continued decline of certain product volumes in the us on the positive side  we expect continued improvement in our inorganic bromine business  where albemarle has attained a strong global position 
our bromine based products are now integrated back to key raw materials in two major regions of the world  which gives us the flexibility to serve customers from arkansas in the united states or safi in jordan 
in addition  the many fine chemicals that have bromine as a component are being developed and supplemented by our research and development teams in the us  europe and asia  and we expect to continue to benefit from the focus on bromine compounds 
with a second half rise in demand for bromine in  we were able to increase prices for some of our products 
this is a very positive sign for  should the broader economic recovery continue 
our jordan bromine company joint venture on the dead sea continues to perform above expectations 
this venture will provide the company with low cost raw materials and derivatives for many years  serving as an important geographic base to support albemarle s sales into europe and asia 
also  the december acquisition of the atofina bromine chemicals business will provide an enhanced manufacturing base and additional products 
albemarle corporation and subsidiaries the other key growth element in fine chemicals is the investment we are making in the development of potential new products  many in conjunction with major pharmaceutical firms 
we have evolved our own strategy to focus earlier in the process  particularly on pharmaceuticals  and we have found strong interest among a growing list of customers  as evidenced by inquiries and quotes offered for our services 
we now have a pipeline of over new opportunities in pre commercial products 
while there is no guarantee that any of these products have commercial viability  our experience suggests that these efforts will drive much of our organic growth 
this development pipeline provides albemarle with several channels to participate in different points of a product life cycle  and creates opportunities to manufacture the next generation of large volume products 
the company s contract research  laboratory  scale up and flexible manufacturing capabilities provide the infrastructure to produce high value niche products in our pipeline 
in addition to general economic pressures  shipments of certain fine chemicals segment products  such as methyl bromide and other agricultural chemicals  are expected to decline over the next few years based on regulatory decisions that impact the marketing life or distribution reach of these products 
for example  methyl bromide  a soil fumigant  is scheduled to be phased out of use in the united states by the beginning of  except for critical uses and other limited exemptions 
there are efforts underway to postpone the phase out  based on the lack of available substitutes in the market 
in addition  in january our zeolites unit serving the us domestic detergent builders industry was idled 
the company is evaluating alternative uses for this asset 
the increasing strength of asian competitors most directly affects the fine chemicals segment  particularly in the larger quantity  generic pharmaceutical products 
just as the company has done in the united states  we are seeking to combat these competitive issues through increased marketing efforts  product enhancements  cost control  sourcing initiatives  and joint ventures 
these competitive pressures are not new issues to the company or the chemical industry  but it is often difficult to predict the impact on our customers 
polymer chemicals the polymer chemicals segment is expected to continue strong growth due to favorable economic conditions  a broad product range and a series of strategic acquisitions over the past few years 
in  two of the company s three acquisitions involved the polymer chemicals segment 
in the catalysts and additives area  the new fuel and lube antioxidants business brought in approximately million in annual net sales to the albemarle portfolio 
the new phosphorus flame retardant business  with sales of about million annually  was added in july 
the two lines were quickly integrated into the company s portfolio  and both are expected to achieve the goal of being accretive to earnings within one year of their purchase 
in the second half of  catalysts and curatives volumes improved  reflecting strength in downstream polyvinyl chloride pvc  polyethylene  and other related plastics markets 
overall  flame retardant volumes were up at double digit levels compared to the corresponding period in pricing for flame retardants held steady for the year versus the prior year 
strong volume trends in polymer chemicals may indicate overall economic improvement  and there are signs the trend could continue into in light of the improving economic environment  we completed construction of a tetrabrom flame retardant production unit in jordan  and provided qualification samples to many european and asian customers 
capacity in this unit is about  metric tons  and the successful start up in jordan gives albemarle  through its joint venture  substantial flexibility in meeting customer needs around the world 
also the acquisition of the phosphorus flame retardant business added a third  critical technology to albemarle s flame retardant line 
our bromine  mineral and phosphorus based products provide us with the ability to offer a variety of solutions to our flame retardant customers  and solidifies our strategy to become the premier  full service flame retardant company 
we continue to look for acquisitions in the polymer chemicals segment that provide a strategic and financial fit 
corporate our drive to expand our global business platform is supported by a strong balance sheet and cash flow 
during  the cash flow from operations provided the fuel for million in acquisitions  million of new capital including joint ventures  million of stock repurchases and million dividends paid 
we continue to have adequate financial headroom to pursue acquisitions and are positioned to raise additional funding if the need arises 
the outlook for is to follow similar themes growth oriented expenditures for acquisitions and capital  dividend payments and selective stock repurchases when warranted 
our pension plan is well funded with pension assets of million at the end of up from million at the start of the year 
we have been able to take advantage of good stock and bond market performance during albemarle corporation and subsidiaries we also have taken steps to reduce our future pension liability by closing the defined pension benefit plan to new employees in the united states beginning in april new employees will have the opportunity to participate in a defined contribution plan 
management continues to exercise control over costs in all areas  and expects to increase funding for research and development as administrative costs are diminished in other areas 
there is significant activity around improving and streamlining our transaction capabilities through the formation of an alliance services group within the company 
as one example of the benefits of this program  we were able to generate orders from albemarle systems within hours of the closing of one recent acquisition in europe 
we have continued to evaluate many acquisition opportunities brought to the market as the industry continues to restructure 
while we will consider equity dilution for larger acquisitions  we are steadfast in our focus on adding value 
this approach results in conservative valuations for possible acquisitions  and an intention to preserve a strong balance sheet 
our dedication to creating wealth for our shareholders is a constant 
in summary  as albemarle enters the next decade we believe the company is well positioned to grow and create additional value for our shareholders 
the company has the underlying technologies  products and organization to participate in the ever changing global chemical industry 
the company has put in place strategies to grow the business and control costs  and believes there is an equal balance between the positive developments within the company and the external forces that moderate growth and profitability

additional information summary of critical accounting policies estimates and assumptions the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
listed below are the estimates and assumptions that the company considers to be significant in the preparation of the financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company estimates losses for uncollectible accounts based on the aging of receivables and the evaluation of the likelihood of success in collecting the receivables 
depreciation book depreciation is estimated based upon internal engineering studies  which are conducted periodically 
engineering and manufacturing  with the advice of specific product management  review each project to make sure that assets to be capitalized are depreciated based upon the estimated product life and or individual asset life  whichever is less 
inventory obsolescence inventories are viewed on a monthly basis to determine age  movement and turnover 
reserves are setup periodically based upon estimates to adjust inventory values in line with their net realizable value 
albemarle corporation and subsidiaries recovery of long lived assets the company evaluates the recovery of its long lived assets on a segment basis by periodically analyzing its operating results and considering significant events or changes in the business environment 
acquisition accounting the company estimates the fair value of assets and liabilities when allocating the purchase price of an acquisition 
income taxes the company assumes the deductibility of certain costs in its income tax filings and estimates the future recovery of deferred tax assets 
legal accruals the company estimates the amount of potential exposure and anticipated cost to defend that it may incur with respect to litigation  claims and assessments 
environmental remediation liabilities the company estimates and accrues the costs required to remediate a specific site depending on site specific facts and circumstances 
cost estimates to remediate each specific site are developed by assessing i the scope of the company s contribution to the environmental matter  ii the scope of the anticipated remediation and monitoring plan  and iii the extent of other parties share of responsibility 
insurance accruals receivables the company records and assumes the recoverability of insurance receivables and potential impact of insurance claims based on the company s estimates after considering advice from in house and outside legal counsel as well as outside consultants 
actual results could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions that the company uses in the preparation of its financial statements 
revenue recognition sales are recognized when the revenue is realized or realizable  and has been earned  in accordance with the us securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
net sales are recognized as risk and title to the product transfer to the customer  which usually occurs at the time shipment is made 
the majority of the company s sales are sold fob free on board shipping point or on an equivalent basis  other transactions are based upon specific contractual arrangements 
albemarle s standard terms of delivery are included in its contracts of sale  order confirmation documents and invoices 
revenue from services is recognized when performance of the services has been completed 
the company has a limited amount of consignment sales that are billed to the customer upon monthly notification of amounts used by the customers under these contracts 
pension plans and other postretirement benefits the company follows the guidance of sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  and sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  when accounting for pension and postretirement benefits 
under these accounting standards  assumptions are made regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets 
delayed recognition of differences between actual results and expected or estimated results is a guiding principle of these standards 
this delayed recognition of actual results allows for the recognition of changes in benefit obligations and plan performance over the working lives of the employees who benefit under the plans 
the primary assumptions are as follows discount rate the discount rate is used in calculating the present value of benefits  which is based on projections of benefit payments to be made in the future 
expected return on plan assets the company projects the future return on plan assets based principally on prior performance 
these projected returns reduce the net benefit costs recorded currently 
rate of compensation increase for salary related plans the company projects employees annual pay increases  which are used to project employees pension benefits at retirement 
rate of increase in the per capita of covered health care benefits the company projects the expected increases in the cost of covered health care benefits 
during  the company made changes to the assumptions related to the discount rate  the rate of compensation increase for salary related plans and the rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits 
the company consults with actuaries when selecting each of these assumptions 
in selecting the discount rate  consideration is given to fixed income security yields  specifically high quality bonds moody s aa corporate bond rate 
at december   the discount rate was reduced for the plans from to as a result of decreased yields for long term high quality bonds 
in estimating the expected return on plan assets  the company considers past performance and future expectations for the types of investments held by the plan as well as the expected long term allocation of plan assets to these investments 
at december   the expected rate of return on pension plan assets was reduced from to and there was no change in the expected return on other postretirement benefit plan assets 
albemarle corporation and subsidiaries in projecting the rate of compensation increase  the company considers past experience in light of movements in inflation rates 
at december   the assumed rate of compensation increase was reduced from to for the plans 
in selecting the rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits  the company considers past performance and forecasts of future health care cost trends 
at december   the previously assumed rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits was decreased 
the assumed health care cost trend rate for for pre coverage was per year  dropping by per year to an ultimate rate of  the trend rate for post coverage was per year  dropping by per year to an ultimate rate of 
the assumed health care cost trend rate for for pre coverage was per year  dropping by per year to an ultimate rate of  the trend rate for post coverage was per year  dropping by per year to an ultimate rate of 
income taxes deferred income taxes result from temporary differences in the recognition of income and expenses for financial and income tax reporting purposes  using the liability or balance sheet method 
such temporary differences result primarily from differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
investments the company has investments in joint ventures  nonmarketable securities and marketable equity securities 
the majority of the company s investments are in joint ventures 
since the company has the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of these joint ventures  they are accounted for using the equity method of accounting

to the company s knowledge  it is currently complying and expects to continue to comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws  regulations  statutes and ordinances 
compliance with existing federal  state  local and foreign environmental protection laws is not expected to have in the future a material effect on earnings or the competitive position of albemarle  but increased legal or regulatory requirements could have an adverse effect on our results 
among other environmental requirements  the company is subject to the federal superfund law  and similar state laws  under which the company may be designated as a potentially responsible party prp and may be liable for a share of the costs associated with cleaning up various hazardous waste sites 
management believes that in most cases  the company s participation is de minimis 
further  almost all such sites represent environmental issues that are quite mature and have been investigated  studied and in albemarle corporation and subsidiaries many cases settled 
in de minimis situations  the company s policy generally is to negotiate a consent decree and to pay any apportioned settlement  enabling the company to be effectively relieved of any further liability as a prp  except for remote contingencies 
in other than de minimis prp matters  the company s records indicate that unresolved prp exposures should be immaterial 
the company accrues and expenses its proportionate share of prp costs

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of operations  the company is exposed to changes in financial market conditions due to the denomination of its business transactions in diverse foreign currencies and the company s ongoing manufacturing and funding activities 
as a result  future earnings  cash flows and fair values of assets and liabilities are subject to market risk 
the company has established policies  procedures and internal processes governing its management of uncertain market conditions  and uses both operational and financial market actions in its risk management activities  which include the use of derivative instruments 
the company does not use derivative instruments for trading purposes 
the company only enters into derivative contracts based on economic analysis of underlying exposures anticipating that adverse impacts on future earnings  cash flows and fair values due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates will be offset by the proceeds from and changes in fair value of the derivative instruments 
the company does not hedge its exposure to market risks in a manner that completely eliminates the effects of changing market conditions on earnings  cash flows and fair values 
short term exposures to changing foreign currency exchange rates are primarily due to operating cash flows denominated in foreign currencies 
the company covers certain known and anticipated operating exposures by using forward contracts 
the primary currencies for which the company has foreign currency exchange rate exposure are the euro  japanese yen  british pound sterling and the us dollar in certain of its foreign locations 
in response to the greater fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in recent periods  the company has increased the degree of risk management activities to minimize the impact on earnings of future periods 
the company s financial instruments  subject to foreign currency exchange risk  consist of foreign currency forward contracts and represented a net asset position of less than million at december  the company conducted a sensitivity analysis on the fair value of its foreign currency hedge portfolio assuming instantaneous changes in foreign currency exchange rates from their levels as of december   with all other variables held constant 
a appreciation of the us dollar against foreign currencies would result in an increase of million in the fair value of foreign currency exchange hedging contracts 
a depreciation of the us dollar against foreign currencies would result in a decrease of million in the fair value of foreign currency exchange hedging contracts 
the sensitivity in fair value of the foreign currency hedge portfolio represents changes in fair values estimated based on market conditions as of december   without reflecting the effects of underlying anticipated transactions 
when those anticipated transactions are realized  actual effects of changing foreign currency exchange rates could have a material impact on earnings and cash flows in future periods 
the company is exposed to changes in interest rates that could impact its results of operations and financial condition 
the company manages the worldwide exposure of its interest rate risks and foreign exchange exposure through its regular operations and financing activities 
the company utilizes a credit agreement as its primary source of financing supplemented by several uncommitted line agreements  which could expose the company to changes in interest rates  if various financial covenants are not met 
the company manages its ratio of debt to capitalization with the objective of achieving the lowest interest rate possible 
a hypothetical change of basis points in the company s effective interest rate on its variable interest rate long term debt at december   would increase or decrease interest expense by approximately million 
raw materials used by the company are subject to price volatility caused by weather  supply conditions  political and economic variables and other unpredictable factors 
the company does not use futures  options and swap contracts to manage the volatility related to the above exposures 
however  management seeks to limit its exposure by entering into long term contracts when available  and seeks price increase limitations through contracts 
the company is exposed to market risk from changes in natural gas prices related to its production requirements 
during  the company began entering into natural gas futures contracts contracts of up to of its month rolling forecast of its north american consumption to help manage its exposure

the unrealized gains and or losses are deferred and reported in accumulated other comprehensive income to the extent that the unrealized gains and losses are offset by the forecasted transaction 
at december   there were unrealized gains of approximately million million after tax in accumulated other comprehensive income
