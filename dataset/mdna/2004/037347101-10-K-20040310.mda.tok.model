item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements included elsewhere in this form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors including those set forth under risk factors herein 
general we were formed in october to invest primarily in mortgage related assets  including mortgage pass through certificates  collateralized mortgage obligations  mortgage loans and other securities representing interests in  or obligations backed by  pools of mortgage loans which can be readily financed 
we commenced operations on march  upon the closing of our initial public offering 
our principal business objective is to generate net income for distribution to stockholders based upon the spread between the interest income on our mortgage backed securities and mortgage loans and the costs of borrowing to finance our acquisition of mortgage backed securities and mortgage loans 
we are organized for tax purposes as a reit 
accordingly  we generally distribute substantially all of our earnings to stockholders without paying federal or state income tax at the corporate level on the distributed earnings 
as of december   our qualified reit assets real estate assets  as defined in the tax code  cash and cash items and government securities were greater than of our total assets  as compared to the tax code requirement that at least of our total assets must be qualified reit assets 
greater than of our revenue qualifies for both the source of income test and the source of income test under the reit rules 
we believe we met all reit requirements regarding the ownership of our common stock and the distributions of our net income 
therefore  we believe that we continue to qualify as a reit under the provisions of the tax code 
from the time of our inception through june   we were externally managed by anworth mortgage advisory company  or the manager  pursuant to a management agreement 
as an externally managed company  we had no employees of our own and relied on the manager to conduct our business and operations 
on june   the manager merged with and into our company 
the merger was approved by a special committee consisting solely of our independent directors  our full board of directors and the vote of a majority of our stockholders 
upon the closing of the merger  the management agreement terminated 
the market value of our common stock issued  valued as of the consummation of the merger  in excess of the fair value of the net tangible assets acquired  has been accounted for as a non cash charge to operating income 
since we did not acquire tangible net assets from the manager in the merger  the non cash charge equaled the value of the consideration paid in the merger  which was approximately million 
this non cash charge did not reduce our taxable income  of which at least must be paid as dividends to stockholders to maintain our status as a reit 
it did  however  reduce our reportable net income 
in addition  we incurred  in merger related expenses 
over the past year  the continued decline in the general level of interest rates has had a materially positive impact on our cost of financing 
as a result of the interest rate reductions by the federal reserve board  the one month libor rate has declined from as of december  to as of december  this decline in short term interest rates has reduced the rates at which we borrow funds to finance our portfolio holdings 
our cost of financing has declined from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  during the same time period  our yield on interest earning assets decreased from to  effectively reducing our spread from to 
on november   we formed a wholly owned subsidiary called belvedere trust mortgage corporation  or belvedere trust 
belvedere trust was formed as a qualified reit subsidiary to acquire and own mortgage loans  with a focus on the high credit quality jumbo adjustable rate  hybrid and second lien mortgage markets 
belvedere trust was also formed with the intent of securitizing the mortgage loans it acquires and selling mortgage backed securities in the capital markets 
we have made an initial investment of million in belvedere trust to capitalize its initial mortgage operations 
we have also formed bt management company  llc  or bt management  a delaware limited liability company that is owned by us  by claus lund  the chief executive officer of belvedere trust  by russell j 
thompson  the chief financial officer of belvedere trust  and by lloyd mcadams  our chairman and chief executive officer 
bt management has entered into a management agreement with belvedere trust pursuant to which bt management will manage the day to day operations of belvedere trust in exchange for an annual base management fee and a quarterly incentive fee 
we believe that over time belvedere trust s business will become an important part of our overall operations and business strategy 
results of operations years ended december  and for the year ended december   our net income was  or per diluted share  based on an average of  shares outstanding 
for the year ended december   our net income was  or per diluted share  based on an average of  shares outstanding 
the decrease in our earnings per share in over was due to an increase in premium amortization expense 
the increase in premium amortization expense resulted from an increase in the constant prepayment rate cpr of our mortgage backed securities  resulting primarily from an extremely high volume of mortgage refinancings driven by the record low interest rates 
these refinancings occurred mainly in the second quarter  and their net effect was realized through the increase in premium amortization expense in the third quarter 
the table below shows the approximate constant prepayment rate of our mortgage assets st qtr nd qtr rd qtr th qtr net interest income for the year ended december  totaled  or of total interest income  compared to  or of total interest income  for the year ended december  net interest income is comprised of the interest income earned on mortgage investments less interest expense from borrowings 
as a result of investing the proceeds of our common stock offerings  our assets and borrowings have increased significantly from last year 
this has resulted in a large increase in our income and interest expense in compared to also  during the year ended december   we realized a net gain on the sale of assets in the amount of  or of total interest income  compared to  or of total interest income  during the year ended december  for the year ended december   our operating expenses increased to  excluding acquisition costs and fees paid to external management company  or of total interest income  from  or of total interest income  for the year ended december  this increase was due primarily to the internalization of the management of our company and increased expenses associated with compensation paid under our incentive compensation plan

this balance sheet size represents an approximate increase over our balance sheet size at december  at december   we were well within our asset allocation guidelines  with approximately of total assets consisting of mortgage backed securities guaranteed by an agency of the united states government such as fannie mae  freddie mac or ginnie mae

our mortgage backed securities had a weighted average coupon of at december  the weighted average one month constant prepayment rates of our mortgage backed securities portfolio were  and  respectively  for the months of october  november and december at december   the unamortized net premium paid for our mortgage backed securities was million 
we analyze our mortgage backed securities for the extent to which prepayments impact the yield of the securities 
when actual prepayments exceed expectations  we amortize the premiums paid on mortgage assets over a shorter time period  resulting in a reduced yield to maturity on our mortgage assets 
conversely  if actual prepayments are less than the assumed constant prepayment rate  the premium would be amortized over a longer time period  resulting in a higher yield to maturity 
we monitor our prepayment expectations versus our actual prepayment experience on a monthly basis in order to adjust the amortization of the net premium 
as of december   the fair value of our portfolio of mortgage related assets classified as available for sale was reduced by million  or less than the amortized cost of our portfolio 
as of december   the fair value of our portfolio of mortgage related assets classified as available for sale was million  or more than the amortized cost of our portfolio 
hedging we periodically enter into derivative transactions  in the form of forward purchase commitments  which are intended to hedge our exposure to rising rates on funds borrowed to finance our investments in securities 
we have designated these transactions as cash flow hedges 
we also enter into derivative transactions  also in the form of forward purchase commitments  which are not designated as hedges 
other than these types of transactions  we have not entered into any hedging agreements to date 
as part of our asset liability management policy  we may enter into hedging agreements such as interest rate caps  floors or swaps 
these agreements would be entered into to try to reduce interest rate risk and would be designed to provide us with income and capital appreciation in the event of certain changes in interest rates 
we review the need for hedging transactions on a regular basis consistent with our capital investment policy 
during the year ended december   we entered into various mortgage backed securities transactions where we agreed to take delivery of the securities more than one month from the trade date 
as directed by accounting rules for these types of extended delivery transactions  the economic benefit or cost that occurs between the trade date and the delivery date are designated as a derivative gain or loss 
we were not a party to any derivative transactions during the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources our primary source of funds consists of repurchase agreements  which totaled  million at december  our other significant source of funds for the year ended december  consisted of payments of principal and interest from our mortgage securities portfolio in the amount of  million 
as of december   we had raised approximately million in capital under our amended dividend reinvestment and direct stock purchase plan  million of which was raised in in the future  we expect that our primary sources of funds will consist of borrowed funds under repurchase agreement transactions with one to twelve month maturities and of monthly payments of principal and interest on our mortgage backed securities portfolio 
our liquid assets generally consist of unpledged mortgage backed securities  cash and cash equivalents 
our borrowings had a weighted average interest cost during the year ended december  of compared with for the year ended december  as of december   all of our repurchase agreements were fixed rate term repurchase agreements with original maturities ranging from one to twenty four months 
on december   we had borrowing arrangements with seventeen different financial institutions and had borrowed funds under repurchase agreements with fifteen of these firms 
because we borrow money based on the fair value of our mortgage backed securities and because increases in short term interest rates can negatively impact the valuation of mortgage backed securities  our borrowing ability could be limited and lenders may initiate margin calls in the event short term interest rates increase or the value of our mortgage backed securities declines for other reasons 
during the year ended december   we had adequate cash flow  liquid assets and unpledged collateral with which to meet our margin requirements during the period 
from time to time  we raise additional equity dependent upon market conditions and other factors 
we intend to raise additional equity through the issuance of capital stock as described in our registration statement on form s that was initially declared effective by the securities and exchange commission in september the registration statement was subsequently amended and the post effective amendment was declared effective in january we completed public offerings pursuant to that registration statement in may and august that raised an aggregate of approximately million in net proceeds 
in december  we entered into a sales agreement with cantor fitzgerald co  or cantor  to sell up to million shares of our common stock from time to time through a controlled equity offering program under which cantor acts as sales agent 
sales of the shares have been made on the american stock exchange and more recently on the new york stock exchange by means of ordinary brokers transactions at market prices and through privately negotiated transactions 
prior to termination of the program on november   we sold all million shares under the program  which provided net proceeds to us of approximately million 
the sales agent received an aggregate of approximately million  which represents a commission of on the gross sales price per share under the sales agreement 
stockholders equity we use available for sale treatment for our mortgage backed securities 
these assets are carried on the balance sheet at fair value rather than historical amortized cost 
based upon such available for sale treatment  our equity base at december  was million  or per share 
with our available for sale accounting treatment  unrealized fluctuations in fair values of assets do not impact gaap income or taxable income but rather are reflected on the balance sheet by changing the carrying value of the asset and reflecting the change in stockholders equity under accumulated other comprehensive income  unrealized gain loss on available for sale securities 
as a result of this mark to market accounting treatment  our book value and book value per share are likely to fluctuate far more than if we used historical amortized cost accounting 
as a result  comparisons with companies that use historical cost accounting for some or all of their balance sheet may not be meaningful 
unrealized changes in the fair value of mortgage backed securities have one significant and direct effect on our potential earnings and dividends positive mark to market changes will increase our equity base and allow us to increase our borrowing capacity while negative changes will tend to limit borrowing capacity under our capital investment policy 
a very large negative change in the net market value of our mortgage backed securities might reduce our liquidity  requiring us to sell assets with the likely result of realized losses upon sale 
accumulated other comprehensive income  unrealized loss on available for sale securities was million  or of the amortized cost of mortgage backed securities at december  critical accounting policies management has the obligation to ensure that its policies and methodologies are in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
during  management reviewed and evaluated its critical accounting policies and believes them to be appropriate 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to makes estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying financial statements 
in preparing these financial statements  management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
we do not believe that there is a great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported related to accounting policies described below 
nevertheless  application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
our accounting policies are described in note to our financial statements 
management believes the more significant of these to be as follows revenue recognition the most significant source of our revenue is derived from our investments in mortgage backed securities 
we reflect income using the effective yield method  which  through amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts  recognizes periodic income over the term of the investment on a constant yield basis  as adjusted for actual prepayment activity 
management believes our revenue recognition policies are appropriate to reflect the substance of the underlying transactions 
interest income on our mortgage backed securities is accrued based on the actual coupon rate and the outstanding principle amount of the underlying mortgages 
premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted into interest income over the lives of the securities using the effective interest yield method adjusted for the effects of estimated prepayments based on the statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for nonrefundable fees and costs associated with originating or acquiring loans and initial direct costs of leases an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and and a rescission of fasb statement no 
our policy for estimating prepayments speeds for calculating the effective yield is to evaluate historical performance  street consensus prepayment speeds and current market conditions 
if our estimate of prepayments is incorrect  we may be required to make an adjustment to the amortization or accretion of premiums and discounts that would have an impact on future income 
valuation of investment securities we carry our investment securities on our balance sheet at fair value 
the fair values of our mortgage backed securities are generally based on market prices provided by certain dealers who make markets in such securities 
the fair values of other marketable securities are obtained from the last reported sale of such securities on its principal exchange or  if no representative sale is reported  the mean between the closing bid and ask prices 
if  in the opinion of management  one or more securities prices reported to us are not reliable or unavailable  management estimates the fair value based on characteristics of the security it receives from the issuer and available market information 
the fair values reported reflect estimates and may not necessarily be indicative of the amounts we could realize in a current market exchange 
income taxes our financial results do not reflect provisions for current or deferred income taxes 
management believes that we have and intend to continue to operate in a manner that will continue to allow us to be taxed as a reit and as a result does not expect to pay substantial corporate level taxes 
many of these requirements  however  are highly technical and complex 
if we were to fail to meet these requirements  we would be subject to federal income tax 
off balance sheet and contractual arrangements management has addressed the issues of off balance sheet contractual obligations and has determined that all such obligations are reflected on the financial statements 
in addition  management has also determined that all reverse repurchase agreements and employment obligations under contract and lease commitments are also fully disclosed on the financial statements 
risk factors an investment in our stock involves a number of risks 
before making a decision to purchase our securities  you should carefully consider all of the risks described in this annual report 
if any of the risks discussed in this annual report actually occur  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
if this were to occur  the trading price of our securities could decline significantly and you may lose all or part of your investment 
risk related to our business interest rate mismatches between our adjustable rate mortgage backed securities and our borrowings used to fund our purchases of the assets may reduce our income during periods of changing interest rates 
we fund most of our acquisitions of adjustable rate mortgage backed securities with borrowings that have interest rates based on indices and repricing terms similar to  but of shorter maturities than  the interest rate indices and repricing terms of our mortgage backed securities 
accordingly  if short term interest rates increase  this may adversely affect our profitability 
most of the mortgage backed securities we acquire are adjustable rate securities 
this means that their interest rates may vary over time based upon changes in a short term interest rate index 
therefore  in most cases the interest rate indices and repricing terms of the mortgage backed securities that we acquire and their funding sources will not be identical  thereby creating an interest rate mismatch between assets and liabilities 
while the historical spread between relevant short term interest rate indices has been relatively stable  there have been periods when the spread between these indices was volatile 
during periods of changing interest rates  these mismatches could reduce our net income  dividend yield and the market price of our stock 
the interest rates on our borrowings generally adjust more frequently than the interest rates on our adjustable rate mortgage backed securities 
for example  on december   our adjustable rate mortgage backed securities had a weighted average term to next rate adjustment of approximately months  while our borrowings had a weighted average term to next rate adjustment of days 
accordingly  in a period of rising interest rates  we could experience a decrease in net income or a net loss because the interest rates on our borrowings adjust faster than the interest rates on our adjustable rate mortgage backed securities 
we may experience reduced net interest income from holding fixed rate investments during periods of rising interest rates 
we generally fund our acquisition of fixed rate mortgage backed securities with short term borrowings 
during periods of rising interest rates  our costs associated with borrowings used to fund acquisition of fixed rate assets are subject to increases while the income we earn from these assets remains substantially fixed 
this reduces or could eliminate the net interest spread between the fixed rate mortgage backed securities that we purchase and our borrowings used to purchase them  which could lower our net interest income or cause us to suffer a loss 
on december   of our mortgage backed securities were fixed rate securities 
increased levels of prepayments from mortgage backed securities may decrease our net interest income 
pools of mortgage loans underlie the mortgage backed securities that we acquire 
we generally receive payments from principal payments that are made on these underlying mortgage loans 
when borrowers prepay their mortgage loans faster than expected  this results in prepayments that are faster than expected on the mortgage backed securities 
faster than expected prepayments could adversely affect our profitability  including in the following ways we usually purchase mortgage backed securities that have a higher interest rate than the market interest rate at the time 
in exchange for this higher interest rate  we pay a premium over the par value to acquire the security 
in accordance with accounting rules  we amortize this premium over the term of the mortgage backed security 
if the mortgage backed security is prepaid in whole or in part prior to its maturity date  however  we expense the premium that was prepaid at the time of the prepayment 
on december   approximately of our mortgage backed securities were acquired at a premium 
we anticipate that a substantial portion of our adjustable rate mortgage backed securities may bear interest rates that are lower than their fully indexed rates  which are equivalent to the applicable index rate plus a margin 
if an adjustable rate mortgage backed security is prepaid prior to or soon after the time of adjustment to a fully indexed rate  we will have held that mortgage backed security while it was less profitable and lost the opportunity to receive interest at the fully indexed rate over the remainder of its expected life 
if we are unable to acquire new mortgage backed securities similar to the prepaid mortgage backed securities  our financial condition  results of operation and cash flow would suffer 
prepayment rates generally increase when interest rates fall and decrease when interest rates rise  but changes in prepayment rates are difficult to predict 
prepayment rates also may be affected by conditions in the housing and financial markets  general economic conditions  seasonal periods and the relative interest rates on fixed rate and adjustable rate mortgage loans 
while we seek to minimize prepayment risk to the extent practical  in selecting investments we must balance prepayment risk against other risks and the potential returns of each investment 
no strategy can completely insulate us from prepayment risk 
our officers devote a portion of their time to another company in capacities that could create conflicts of interest that may adversely affect our investment opportunities  this lack of a full time commitment could also adversely affect our operating results 
lloyd mcadams  joseph e 
mcadams  evangelos karagiannis  bistra pashamova and other of our officers and employees are officers and employees of pacific income advisers  inc  or pia  where they devote a portion of their time 
these officers and employees are under no contractual obligations mandating minimum amounts of time to be devoted to our company 
in addition  a trust controlled by lloyd mcadams and heather u 
baines is the principal stockholder of pia 
these officers and employees are involved in investing both our assets and approximately billion in mortgage backed securities and other fixed income assets for institutional clients and individual investors through pia 
these multiple responsibilities and ownerships may create conflicts of interest if these officers and employees of our company are presented with opportunities that may benefit both us and the clients of pia 
these officers allocate investments among our portfolio and the clients of pia by determining the entity or account for which the investment is most suitable 
in making this determination  these officers consider the investment strategy and guidelines of each entity or account with respect to acquisition of assets  leverage  liquidity and other factors that our officers determine appropriate 
these officers  however  have no obligation to make any specific investment opportunities available to us and the above mentioned conflicts of interest may result in decisions or allocations of securities that are not in our best interests 
several of our officers and employees are also directors  officers and managers of bt management company  llc  the company that will manage the day to day operations of belvedere trust mortgage corporation  our newly formed mortgage loan subsidiary  and lloyd mcadams is also an owner and officer of syndicated capital  a registered broker dealer 
our officers service to pia  bt management company  llc and syndicated capital allow them to spend only part of their time and effort managing our company as they are required to devote a portion of their time and effort to the management of other companies and this may adversely affect our overall management and operating results 
we may incur increased borrowing costs related to repurchase agreements and that would adversely affect our profitability 
currently  all of our borrowings are collateralized borrowings in the form of repurchase agreements 
if the interest rates on these repurchase agreements increase  that would adversely affect our profitability 
our borrowing costs under repurchase agreements generally correspond to short term interest rates such as libor or a short term treasury index  plus or minus a margin 
the margins on these borrowings over or under short term interest rates may vary depending upon the movement of interest rates  the availability of financing in the market  and the value and liquidity of our mortgage backed securities 
interest rate caps on our adjustable rate mortgage backed securities may reduce our income or cause us to suffer a loss during periods of rising interest rates 
our adjustable rate mortgage backed securities are typically subject to periodic and lifetime interest rate caps 
periodic interest rate caps limit the amount an interest rate can increase during any given period 
lifetime interest rate caps limit the amount an interest rate can increase through maturity of a mortgage backed security 
our borrowings are not subject to similar restrictions 
accordingly  in a period of rapidly increasing interest rates  the interest rates paid on our borrowings could increase without limitation while interest rate caps would limit the interest rates on our adjustable rate mortgage backed securities 
this problem is magnified for our adjustable rate mortgage backed securities that are not fully indexed 
further  some adjustable rate mortgage backed securities may be subject to periodic payment caps that result in a portion of the interest being deferred and added to the principal outstanding 
as a result  we could receive less cash income on adjustable rate mortgage backed securities than we need to pay interest on our related borrowings 
these factors could lower our net interest income or cause us to suffer a loss during periods of rising interest rates 
on december   approximately of our mortgage backed securities were adjustable rate securities 
our leveraging strategy increases the risks of our operations 
we generally borrow between eight and twelve times the amount of our equity  although our borrowings may at times be above or below this amount 
we incur this leverage by borrowing against a substantial portion of the market value of our mortgage backed securities 
use of leverage can enhance our investment returns 
leverage  however  also increases risks 
in the following ways  the use of leverage increases our risk of loss and may reduce our net income by increasing the risks associated with other risk factors  including a decline in the market value of our mortgage backed securities or a default of a mortgage related asset the use of leverage increases our risk of loss resulting from various factors including rising interest rates  increased interest rate volatility  downturns in the economy and reductions in the availability of financing or deteriorations in the conditions of any of our mortgage related assets 
a majority of our borrowings are secured by our mortgage backed securities  generally under repurchase agreements 
a decline in the market value of the mortgage backed securities used to secure these debt obligations could limit our ability to borrow or result in lenders requiring us to pledge additional collateral to secure our borrowings 
in that situation  we could be required to sell mortgage backed securities under adverse market conditions in order to obtain the additional collateral required by the lender 
if these sales are made at prices lower than the carrying value of the mortgage backed securities  we would experience losses 
a default of a mortgage related asset that constitutes collateral for a loan could also result in an involuntary liquidation of the mortgage related asset 
this would result in a loss to us of the difference between the value of the mortgage related asset upon liquidation and the amount borrowed against the mortgage related asset 
to the extent we are compelled to liquidate qualified reit assets to repay debts  our compliance with the reit rules regarding our assets and our sources of income could be affected  which could jeopardize our status as a reit 
losing our reit status would cause us to lose tax advantages applicable to reits and may decrease our overall profitability and distributions to our stockholders 
we have not extensively used derivatives to mitigate our interest rate and prepayment risks and this leaves us exposed to certain risks 
our policies permit us to enter into interest rate swaps  caps and floors and other derivative transactions to help us reduce our interest rate and prepayment risks described above 
we have made only limited use of these types of instruments as discussed under hedging above 
we have determined that  generally  the costs of these transactions outweigh their benefits 
this strategy saves us the additional costs of such hedging transactions  but it leaves us exposed to the types of risks that such hedging transactions would be designed to reduce 
if we decide to enter into derivative transactions in the future  these transactions may mitigate our interest rate and prepayment risks but cannot eliminate these risks 
additionally  the use of derivative transactions could have a negative impact on our earnings 
an increase in interest rates may adversely affect our book value 
increases in interest rates may negatively affect the market value of our mortgage related assets 
our fixed rate securities are generally more negatively affected by these increases 
in accordance with accounting rules  we reduce our book value by the amount of any decrease in the market value of our mortgage related assets 
losses on securities classified as available for sale which are determined by management to be other than temporary in nature are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to current operations 
we may invest in leveraged mortgage derivative securities that generally experience greater volatility in market prices  thus exposing us to greater risk with respect to their rate of return 
we may acquire leveraged mortgage derivative securities that may expose us to a high level of interest rate risk 
the characteristics of leveraged mortgage derivative securities result in greater volatility in their market prices 
thus  acquisition of leveraged mortgage derivative securities would expose us to the risk of greater price volatility in our portfolio and that could adversely affect our net income and overall profitability 
we depend on borrowings to purchase mortgage related assets and reach our desired amount of leverage 
if we fail to obtain or renew sufficient funding on favorable terms  we will be limited in our ability to acquire mortgage related assets and our earnings and profitability would decline 
we depend on short term borrowings to fund acquisitions of mortgage related assets and reach our desired amount of leverage 
accordingly  our ability to achieve our investment and leverage objectives depends on our ability to borrow money in sufficient amounts and on favorable terms 
in addition  we must be able to renew or replace our maturing short term borrowings on a continuous basis 
moreover  we depend on a limited number of lenders to provide the primary credit facilities for our purchases of mortgage related assets 
if we cannot renew or replace maturing borrowings  we may have to sell our mortgage related assets under adverse market conditions and may incur permanent capital losses as a result 
any number of these factors in combination may cause difficulties for us  including a possible liquidation of a major portion of our portfolio at disadvantageous prices with consequent losses  which may render us insolvent 
possible market developments could cause our lenders to require us to pledge additional assets as collateral 
if our assets are insufficient to meet the collateral requirements  then we may be compelled to liquidate particular assets at an inopportune time 
possible market developments  including a sharp rise in interest rates  a change in prepayment rates or increasing market concern about the value or liquidity of one or more types of mortgage related assets in which our portfolio is concentrated  may reduce the market value of our portfolio  which may cause our lenders to require additional collateral 
this requirement for additional collateral may compel us to liquidate our assets at a disadvantageous time  thus adversely affecting our operating results and net profitability 
our use of repurchase agreements to borrow funds may give our lenders greater rights in the event that either we or a lender files for bankruptcy 
our borrowings under repurchase agreements may qualify for special treatment under the bankruptcy code  giving our lenders the ability to avoid the automatic stay provisions of the bankruptcy code and to take possession of and liquidate our collateral under the repurchase agreements without delay in the event that we file for bankruptcy 
furthermore  the special treatment of repurchase agreements under the bankruptcy code may make it difficult for us to recover our pledged assets in the event that a lender files for bankruptcy 
thus  the use of repurchase agreements exposes our pledged assets to risk in the event of a bankruptcy filing by either a lender or us 
because assets we acquire may experience periods of illiquidity  we may lose profits or be prevented from earning capital gains if we cannot sell mortgage related assets at an opportune time 
we bear the risk of being unable to dispose of our mortgage related assets at advantageous times or in a timely manner because mortgage related assets generally experience periods of illiquidity 
the lack of liquidity may result from the absence of a willing buyer or an established market for these assets  as well as legal or contractual restrictions on resale 
as a result  the illiquidity of mortgage related assets may cause us to lose profits and the ability to earn capital gains 
we depend on our key personnel and the loss of any of our key personnel could severely and detrimentally affect our operations 
we depend on the diligence  experience and skill of our officers and other employees for the selection  structuring and monitoring of our mortgage related assets and associated borrowings 
our key officers include lloyd mcadams  president  chairman and chief executive officer  joseph e 
mcadams  chief investment officer  executive vice president and director  thad brown  chief financial officer  evangelos karagiannis  vice president  and bistra pashamova  vice president 
our dependence on our key personnel is heightened by the fact that we have a relatively small number of employees  and the loss of any key person could harm our entire business  financial condition  cash flow and results of operations 
in particular  the loss of the services of lloyd mcadams or joseph e 
mcadams could seriously harm our business 
our board of directors may change our operating policies and strategies without prior notice or stockholder approval and such changes could harm our business  results of operation and stock price 
our board of directors can modify or waive our current operating policies and our strategies without prior notice and without stockholder approval 
we cannot predict the effect any changes to our current operating policies and strategies may have on our business  operating results and stock price  however  the effects may be adverse 
our incentive compensation plan may create an incentive to increase the risk of our mortgage portfolio in an attempt to increase compensation 
in addition to their base salaries  management and key employees are eligible to earn incentive compensation for each fiscal year pursuant to our incentive compensation plan 
under the plan  the aggregate amount of compensation that may be earned by all employees equals a percentage of taxable net income  before incentive compensation  in excess of the amount that would produce an annualized return on average net worth equal to the ten year us treasury rate plus 
in any fiscal quarter in which our taxable net income is an amount less than the amount necessary to earn this threshold return  we calculate negative incentive compensation for that fiscal quarter which will be carried forward and will offset future incentive compensation earned under the plan  but only with respect to those participants who were participants during the fiscal quarter s in which negative incentive compensation was generated 
although negative incentive compensation is used to offset future incentive compensation  as our management evaluates different mortgage backed securities for our investment  there is a risk that management will cause us to assume more risk than is prudent 
competition may prevent us from acquiring mortgage related assets at favorable yields and that would negatively impact our profitability 
our net income largely depends on our ability to acquire mortgage related assets at favorable spreads over our borrowing costs 
in acquiring mortgage related assets  we compete with other reits  investment banking firms  savings and loan associations  banks  insurance companies  mutual funds  other lenders and other entities that purchase mortgage related assets  many of which have greater financial resources than us 
as a result  we may not in the future be able to acquire sufficient mortgage related assets at favorable spreads over our borrowing costs 
if that occurs  our profitability will be harmed 
our investment policy involves risks associated with the credit quality of our investments 
if the credit quality of our investments declines or if there are defaults on the investments we make  our profitability may decline and we may suffer losses 
our mortgage backed securities have primarily been agency certificates that  although not rated  carry an implied aaa rating 
agency certificates are mortgage backed securities where either freddie mac or fannie mae guarantees payments of principal or interest on the certificates 
freddie mac and fannie mae are government sponsored enterprises and securities guaranteed by these entities are not guaranteed by the united states government 
our capital investment policy  however  provides us with the ability to acquire a material amount of lower credit quality mortgage backed securities 
if we acquire mortgage backed securities of lower credit quality  our profitability may decline and we may incur losses if there are defaults on the mortgages backing those securities or if the rating agencies downgrade the credit quality of those securities or the securities of fannie mae and freddie mac 
we have not previously engaged in the business of acquiring and securitizing whole mortgage loans and we may not be successful 
we recently formed a new subsidiary called belvedere trust mortgage corporation  or belvedere trust  to engage in the business of acquiring and securitizing whole mortgage loans 
although we hired a management team that we believe has appropriate experience managing the acquisition and securitization of whole loans  we have never engaged in this particular business and we may not be successful 
the acquisition of whole loans and the securitization process are inherently complex and involve risks related to the types of mortgages we seek to acquire  interest rate changes  funding sources  delinquency rates  borrower bankruptcies and other factors that we may not be able to manage 
our failure to manage these and other risks could have a material adverse affect on our business and results of operations 
belvedere trust s investment strategy of acquiring  accumulating and securitizing loans involves credit risk 
while belvedere trust intends to securitize the loans that it acquires into high quality assets in order to achieve better financing rates and to improve its access to financing  it bears the risk of loss on any loans that its acquires or originates and which it subsequently securitizes 
belvedere trust will acquire loans that are not credit enhanced and that do not have the backing of fannie mae or freddie mac 
accordingly  it will be subject to risks of borrower default  bankruptcy and special hazard losses such as those occurring from earthquakes with respect to those loans to the extent that there is any deficiency between the value of the mortgage collateral and insurance and the principal amount of the loan 
in the event of a default on any such loans that it holds  belvedere trust would bear the loss of principal between the value of the mortgaged property and the outstanding indebtedness  as well as the loss of interest 
belvedere trust will require a significant amount of cash  and if it is not available  the business and financial performance of belvedere trust will be significantly harmed 
belvedere trust will require substantial cash to fund its loan acquisitions  to pay its loan acquisition expenses and to hold its loans pending sale or securitization 
belvedere trust will also need cash to meet its working capital and other needs 
pending sale or securitization of a pool of mortgage loans  belvedere trust will acquire mortgage loans that it expects to finance through borrowings from warehouse lines of credit and repurchase facilities 
it is possible that belvedere trust s future warehouse lenders could experience changes in their ability to advance funds to belvedere trust  independent of the performance of belvedere trust or its loans 
we anticipate that belvedere trust s repurchase facilities will be dependent on the ability of counter parties to re sell belvedere trust s obligations to third parties 
if there is a disruption of the repurchase market generally  or if one of belvedere trust s counter parties is itself unable to access the repurchase market  belvedere trust s access to this source of liquidity could be adversely affected 
cash could also be required to meet margin calls under the terms of belvedere trust s borrowings in the event that there is a decline in the market value of the loans that collateralize its debt  the terms of short term debt become less attractive  or for other reasons 
any of these events would have a material adverse affect on belvedere trust 
for some period of time  belvedere trust will use the net proceeds of our investment in belvedere trust to meet its operating expenses as it acquires new loans for its portfolio 
if belvedere trust has fully invested all of the net proceeds of our investment in it prior to the point at which belvedere trust generates sufficient cash for it to fund its operations  if it ever does  then belvedere trust will need to either restructure the securities supporting its portfolio  require additional capital from us or third parties or  if it is unable to sell additional securities on reasonable terms or at all  it will need to either reduce its acquisition business or sell a higher portion of its loans 
in the event that belvedere trust s liquidity needs exceed its access to liquidity  it may need to sell assets at an inopportune time  thus reducing its earnings 
adverse cash flow could threaten belvedere trust s ability to maintain its solvency or to satisfy the income and asset tests necessary to elect and maintain reit status 
the use of securitizations with over collateralization requirements may have a negative impact on belvedere trust s cash flow 
belvedere trust expects that its securitizations will restrict its cash flow if the loan delinquencies exceed certain levels 
the terms of the securitization will generally provide that  if certain delinquencies and or losses exceed the specified levels based on rating agencies or the financial guaranty insurer s  if applicable analysis of the characteristics of the loans pledged to collateralize the securities  the required level of over collateralization may be increased or may be prevented from decreasing as would otherwise be permitted if losses and or delinquencies did not exceed those levels 
other tests based on delinquency levels or other criteria may restrict belvedere trust s ability to receive net interest income from a securitization transaction 
we cannot assure you that the performance tests will be satisfied 
nor can we assure you  in advance of completing negotiations with the rating agencies or other key transaction parties on our future securitizations  the actual terms of the delinquency tests  over collateralization terms  cash flow release mechanisms or other significant factors regarding the calculation of net excess income to belvedere trust 
failure to obtain the terms on a favorable basis may materially and adversely affect the availability of net excess income to belvedere trust 
the success of belvedere trust s loan business will depend upon its ability to ensure that loans to be held in its securitizations are serviced effectively 
the success of belvedere trust s mortgage loan business will depend to a great degree upon its ability to ensure that its loans held for securitization are serviced effectively 
in general  it is the intention of belvedere trust to acquire loans servicing retained  where the loans will be serviced by the originating or selling institution 
belvedere trust has no experience servicing a portfolio of loans 
if belvedere trust is required to purchase the servicing of a loan portfolio in order to acquire a portfolio with desirable attributes  belvedere trust will be required to implement a servicing function or contract with a third party to service the loans in order for belvedere trust to implement its strategy 
we cannot assure you that belvedere trust will be able to service the loans or effectively supervise a sub servicing relationship according to industry standards 
failure to service the loans properly will harm belvedere trust s business and operating results 
prior to either building the servicing capabilities that belvedere trust may require or acquiring an existing servicing operation that has such capabilities  if ever  belvedere trust anticipates contracting with an experienced servicer of non conforming loans to sub service its loans 
the fees paid to a subservicer will reduce to a certain extent the revenue belvedere trust is able to retain from its loans  and its net interest income will be reduced by and at risk  depending on the effectiveness of the servicing company 
if actual prepayments or defaults with respect to mortgages serviced occurs more quickly than originally assumed  the value of belvedere trust s mortgage servicing rights would be subject to downward adjustment 
when belvedere trust purchases mortgages that include the associated servicing rights  the allocated cost of the servicing rights will be reflected on its financial statements as mortgage servicing rights 
to determine the fair value of these servicing rights  belvedere trust will use assumptions to estimate future net servicing income including projected discount rates  mortgage loan prepayments and credit losses 
if actual prepayments or defaults with respect to loans serviced occur more quickly than belvedere trust originally assumed  belvedere trust would have to reduce the carrying value of its mortgage servicing rights 
belvedere trust does not know if its assumptions will prove correct 
belvedere trust will be externally managed and this may diminish or eliminate our return on our investment in this line of business 
belvedere trust will be externally managed pursuant to a management agreement between belvedere trust and bt management company  llc  or bt management 
although we own of bt management  it is also owned by claus lund  the chief executive officer of belvedere trust  by russell j 
thompson  the chief financial officer of belvedere trust and by lloyd mcadams  our chairman and chief executive officer 
our ability to generate profits from our ownership of belvedere trust  if any  could be greatly diminished due to the fact that we will be required to pay a base management fee to bt management and we may also be required to pay an incentive fee 
an externally managed structure may not optimize our interest in belvedere trust and  if we are unable to properly manage fixed costs at belvedere trust could  when combined with the base management fee  result in losses at belvedere trust 
our chairman has an ownership interest in bt management that creates potential conflicts of interest 
mr 
mcadams  our chairman and chief executive officer  has a direct ownership interest in bt management that creates potential conflicts of interest 
mr 
mcadams is chairman of the board and chief executive officer and a member of the board of managers of bt management and owns an equity interest in bt management 
under the management agreement between belvedere trust and bt management  bt management is entitled to earn certain incentive compensation based on the level of belvedere trust s annualized net income 
in evaluating mortgage assets for investment and with respect to other management strategies  an undue emphasis on the maximization of income at the expense of other criteria could result in increased risk to the value of our portfolio 
risks related to reit compliance and other matters if we are disqualified as a reit  we will be subject to tax as a regular corporation and face substantial tax liability 
we believe that since our initial public offering in we have operated so as to qualify as a reit under the internal revenue code of  as amended the tax code  and we intend to continue to meet the requirements for taxation as a reit 
nevertheless  we may not remain qualified as a reit in the future 
qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex tax code provisions for which only a limited number of judicial or administrative interpretations exist 
even a technical or inadvertent mistake could jeopardize our reit status 
furthermore  congress or the irs might change tax laws or regulations and the courts might issue new rulings  in each case potentially having retroactive effect that could make it more difficult or impossible for us to qualify as a reit 
if we fail to qualify as a reit in any tax year  then we would be taxed as a regular domestic corporation  which  among other things  means being unable to deduct distributions to stockholders in computing taxable income and being subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates  any resulting tax liability could be substantial and would reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to stockholders  and unless we were entitled to relief under applicable statutory provisions  we would be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the subsequent four taxable years following the year during which we lost our qualification  and thus  our cash available for distribution to stockholders would be reduced for each of the years during which we do not qualify as a reit 
complying with reit requirements may cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities 
in order to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes  we must continually satisfy tests concerning  among other things  our sources of income  the nature and diversification of our mortgage backed securities and other assets  including our stock in belvedere trust  the amounts we distribute to our stockholders and the ownership of our stock 
we may also be required to make distributions to stockholders at disadvantageous times or when we do not have funds readily available for distribution 
thus  compliance with reit requirements may hinder our ability to operate solely on the basis of maximizing profits 
complying with reit requirements may limit our ability to hedge effectively 
the reit provisions of the tax code may substantially limit our ability to hedge mortgage backed securities and related borrowings by requiring us to limit our income in each year from qualified hedges  together with any other income not generated from qualified reit real estate assets  to less than of our gross income 
in addition  we must limit our aggregate income from hedging and services from all sources  other than from qualified reit real estate assets or qualified hedges  to less than of our annual gross income 
as a result  although we do not currently engage in hedging transactions  we may in the future have to limit our use of advantageous hedging techniques 
this could result in greater risks associated with changes in interest rates than we would otherwise want to incur 
if we were to violate the or limitations  we may have to pay a penalty tax equal to the amount of income in excess of those limitations  multiplied by a fraction intended to reflect our profitability 
if we fail to satisfy the and limitations  unless our failure was due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect  we could lose our reit status for federal income tax purposes 
complying with reit requirements may force us to liquidate otherwise attractive investments 
in order to qualify as a reit  we must also ensure that at the end of each calendar quarter at least of the value of our assets consists of cash  cash items  government securities and qualified reit real estate assets 
the remainder of our investment in securities generally cannot include more than of the outstanding voting securities of any one issuer or more than of the total value of the outstanding securities of any one issuer 
in addition  in general  no more than of the value of our assets can consist of the securities of any one issuer 
the and limitations described above will apply to our investment in belvedere trust unless belvedere trust is a qualified reit subsidiary of ours ie  we own of belvedere trust s outstanding stock  belvedere trust is a qualified reit  or belvedere trust is a taxable reit subsidiary of ours 
if we fail to comply with these requirements  we must dispose of a portion of our assets within days after the end of the calendar quarter in order to avoid losing our reit status and suffering adverse tax consequences 
complying with reit requirements may force us to borrow to make distributions to stockholders 
as a reit  we must distribute of our annual taxable income subject to certain adjustments to our stockholders 
from time to time  we may generate taxable income greater than our net income for financial reporting purposes from  among other things  amortization of capitalized purchase premiums  or our taxable income may be greater than our cash flow available for distribution to stockholders 
for example  our taxable income would exceed our net income for financial reporting purposes to the extent that compensation paid to our chief executive officer and our other four highest paid officers exceeds  for any such officer for any calendar year under section m of the tax code 
since payments under our incentive compensation plan do not qualify as performance based compensation under section m  a portion of the payments made under such plan to certain of such officers would not be deductible for federal income tax purposes under such circumstances 
if we do not have other funds available in these situations  we may be unable to distribute substantially all of our taxable income as required by the reit provisions of the tax code 
thus  we could be required to borrow funds  sell a portion of our mortgage backed securities at disadvantageous prices or find another alternative source of funds 
these alternatives could increase our costs or reduce our equity 
if belvedere trust fails to qualify as a reit  a qualified reit subsidiary or a taxable reit subsidiary  we may lose our reit status 
as long as we own of belvedere trust s outstanding stock  belvedere trust will be treated as a qualified reit subsidiary for federal income tax purposes 
as such  for federal income tax purposes  we will not be treated as owning stock in belvedere trust and belvedere trust s assets  liabilities and income will generally be treated as our assets  liabilities and income for purposes of the reit qualification tests described above under certain federal income tax considerations 
if  however  we do not own of belvedere trust s outstanding stock  and belvedere trust does not qualify as a reit or a taxable reit subsidiary  we will lose our reit status if  at the end of any calendar quarter  the value of our belvedere trust securities exceeds of the value of our total assets or we own more than of the value or voting power of belvedere trust s outstanding securities 
if we fail to satisfy the test or the test at the end of any calendar quarter  a day cure period may apply following the close of the quarter 
if we make an election to treat belvedere trust as a taxable reit subsidiary  the total value of any securities we own in belvedere trust and all of our other taxable reit subsidiaries  if any  may not exceed of the value of our total assets at the end of any calendar quarter 
since belvedere trust may elect to be taxed as a reit in the future  however  we do not intend to make a taxable reit subsidiary election for belvedere trust if belvedere trust fails to qualify as a reit  belvedere trust will be subject to corporate income taxes on its taxable income  which will reduce the amount available for distribution to us 
belvedere trust was formed as a qualified reit subsidiary  but may elect to be taxed to be as a reit in the future  possibly as early as its taxable year ending december  although belvedere trust expects to operate in a manner to permit it to qualify as a reit if and when it makes a reit election and to continue to maintain such qualification  the actual results of belvedere trust s operations for any particular taxable year may not satisfy these requirements 
if belvedere trust fails to qualify for taxation as a reit in any taxable year after it makes a reit election  and the relief provisions of the tax code do not apply  belvedere trust will be required to pay tax on belvedere trust s taxable income in that taxable year and all subsequent taxable years at regular corporate rates 
distributions to us in any year in which belvedere trust fails to qualify as a reit will not be deductible by belvedere trust 
as a result  we anticipate that belvedere trust s failure to qualify as a reit after it makes a reit election would reduce the cash available for distribution to us 
unless entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions  if belvedere trust fails to maintain its reit status after it makes a reit election  belvedere trust will also be disqualified from taxation as a reit for the four taxable years following the year in which it loses its qualification 
failure to maintain an exemption from the investment company act would adversely affect our results of operations 
we believe that we conduct our business in a manner that allows us to avoid being regulated as an investment company under the investment company act of  as amended 
if we fail to continue to qualify for an exemption from registration as an investment company  our ability to use leverage would be substantially reduced and we would be unable to conduct our business as planned 
the investment company act exempts entities that are primarily engaged in the business of purchasing or otherwise acquiring mortgages and other liens on and interests in real estate 
under the sec s current interpretation  qualification for this exemption generally requires us to maintain at least of our assets directly in qualifying real estate interests 
mortgage backed securities that do not represent all the certificates issued with respect to an underlying pool of mortgages may be treated as securities separate from the underlying mortgage loans and thus may not qualify for purposes of the requirement 
therefore  our ownership of these mortgage backed securities is limited by the investment company act 
in meeting the requirement under the investment company act  we treat as qualifying interests mortgage backed securities issued with respect to an underlying pool for which we hold all issued certificates 
if the sec or its staff adopts a contrary interpretation  we could be required to sell a substantial amount of our mortgage backed securities under potentially adverse market conditions 
further  in order to maintain our exemption from registration as an investment company  we may be precluded from acquiring mortgage backed securities whose yield is somewhat higher than the yield on mortgage backed securities that could be purchased in a manner consistent with the exemption 
additional risk factors we may not be able to use the money we raise to acquire investments at favorable prices 
we intend to seek to raise additional capital from time to time if we determine that it is in our best interests and the best interests of our stockholders  including through public offerings of our stock 
the net proceeds of any offering could represent a significant increase in our equity 
depending on the amount of leverage that we use  the full investment of the net proceeds of any offering might result in a substantial increase in our total assets 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to invest all of such additional funds in mortgage backed securities at favorable prices 
we may not be able to acquire enough mortgage backed securities to become fully invested after an offering  or we may have to pay more for mortgage backed securities than we have historically 
in either case  the return that we earn on stockholders equity may be reduced 
we have not established a minimum dividend payment level and there are no assurances of our ability to pay dividends in the future 
we intend to pay quarterly dividends and to make distributions to our stockholders in amounts such that all or substantially all of our taxable income in each year  subject to certain adjustments  is distributed 
this  along with other factors  should enable us to qualify for the tax benefits accorded to a reit under the tax code 
we have not established a minimum dividend payment level and our ability to pay dividends may be adversely affected by the risk factors described in this annual report on form k 
all distributions will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our earnings  our financial condition  maintenance of our reit status and such other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant from time to time 
there are no assurances of our ability to pay dividends in the future 
if we raise additional capital  our earnings per share and dividends per share may decline since we may not be able to invest all of the new capital during the quarter in which additional shares are sold and possibly the entire following calendar quarter 
we may incur excess inclusion income that would increase the tax liability of our stockholders 
in general  dividend income that a tax exempt entity receives from us should not constitute unrelated business taxable income as defined in section of the tax code 
if we realize excess inclusion income and allocate it to stockholders  this income cannot be offset by net operating losses 
if the stockholder was a tax exempt entity  then this income would be fully taxable as unrelated business taxable income under section of the tax code 
if the stockholder was foreign  then it would be subject to federal income tax withholding on this income without reduction pursuant to any otherwise applicable income tax treaty 
excess inclusion income could result if we or belvedere trust held a residual interest in a remic 
excess inclusion income also would be generated if we or belvedere trust were to issue debt obligations with two or more maturities and the terms of the payments on these obligations bore a relationship to the payments that we received on our mortgage backed securities securing those debt obligations 
we generally structure our borrowing arrangements in a manner designed to avoid generating significant amounts of excess inclusion income 
we do  however  enter into various repurchase agreements that have differing maturity dates and afford the lender the right to sell any pledged mortgage securities if we default on our obligations 
the irs may determine that these borrowings give rise to excess inclusion income that should be allocated among stockholders 
furthermore  some types of tax exempt entities  including  without limitation  voluntary employee benefit associations and entities that have borrowed funds to acquire their shares of our common stock  may be required to treat a portion of or all of the dividends they may receive from us as unrelated business taxable income 
we also invest in equity securities of other reits 
if we were to receive excess inclusion income from another reit  we may be required to distribute the excess inclusion income to our stockholders  which may result in the recognition of unrelated business taxable income 
our charter does not permit ownership of over of our common or preferred stock and attempts to acquire our common or preferred stock in excess of the limit are void without prior approval from our board of directors 
for the purpose of preserving our reit qualification and for other reasons  our charter prohibits direct or constructive ownership by any person of more than of the lesser of the total number or value of the outstanding shares of our common stock or more than of the outstanding shares of our preferred stock 
our charter s constructive ownership rules are complex and may cause the outstanding stock owned by a group of related individuals or entities to be deemed to be constructively owned by one individual or entity 
as a result  the acquisition of less than of the outstanding stock by an individual or entity could cause that individual or entity to own constructively in excess of of the outstanding stock  and thus be subject to our charter s ownership limit 
any attempt to own or transfer shares of our common or preferred stock in excess of the ownership limit without the consent of the board of directors shall be void  and will result in the shares being transferred by operation of law to a charitable trust 
our board of directors has previously granted lloyd mcadams  our president  chairman and chief executive officer  and his family members an exemption from the ownership limitation as set forth in our charter documents 
this exemption allowed lloyd mcadams  heather baines and joseph mcadams collectively to hold up to of our outstanding shares 
our board of directors has recently terminated this exemption 
because provisions contained in maryland law  our charter and our bylaws may have an anti takeover effect  investors may be prevented from receiving a control premium for their shares 
provisions contained in our charter and bylaws  as well as maryland corporate law  may have anti takeover effects that delay  defer or prevent a takeover attempt  which may prevent stockholders from receiving a control premium for their shares 
for example  these provisions may defer or prevent tender offers for our common stock or purchases of large blocks of our common stock  thereby limiting the opportunities for our stockholders to receive a premium for their common stock over then prevailing market prices 
these provisions include the following ownership limit 
the ownership limit in our charter limits related investors  including  among other things  any voting group  from acquiring over of our common stock without our permission 
preferred stock 
our charter authorizes our board of directors to issue preferred stock in one or more classes and to establish the preferences and rights of any class of preferred stock issued 
these actions can be taken without soliciting stockholder approval 
maryland business combination statute 
maryland law restricts the ability of holders of more than of the voting power of a corporation s shares to engage in a business combination with the corporation 
maryland control share acquisition statute 
maryland law limits the voting rights of control shares of a corporation in the event of a control share acquisition 
issuances of large amounts of our stock could cause the price of our stock to decline 
we may issue additional shares of common stock or shares of preferred stock that are convertible into common stock 
if we issue a significant number of shares of common stock or convertible preferred stock in a short period of time  there could be a dilution of the existing common stock and a decrease in the market price of the common stock 
future offerings of debt securities  which would be senior to our common stock upon liquidation  or equity securities  which would dilute our existing stockholders and may be senior to our common stock for the purposes of dividend distributions  may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
in the future  we may attempt to increase our capital resources by making additional offerings of debt or equity securities  including commercial paper  medium term notes  senior or subordinated notes and classes of preferred stock or common stock 
upon liquidation  holders of our debt securities and shares of preferred stock and lenders with respect to other borrowings will receive a distribution of our available assets prior to the holders of our common stock 
our preferred stock  if issued  may have a preference on dividend payments that could limit our ability to make a dividend distribution to the holders of our common stock 
because our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control  we cannot predict or estimate the amount  timing or nature of our future offerings 
thus  our stockholders bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the market price of our common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we seek to manage the interest rate  market value  liquidity  prepayment and credit risks inherent in all financial institutions in a prudent manner designed to insure our longevity while  at the same time  seeking to provide an opportunity for stockholders to realize attractive total rates of return through ownership of our common stock 
while we do not seek to avoid risk completely  we do seek  to the best of our ability  to assume risk that can be quantified from historical experience  to actively manage that risk  to earn sufficient compensation to justify taking those risks and to maintain capital levels consistent with the risks we undertake 
interest rate risk we primarily invest in adjustable rate  hybrid and fixed rate mortgage backed securities 
hybrid mortgages are adjustable rate mortgages that have a fixed interest rate for an initial period of time typically three years and five years and then convert to a one year adjustable rate for the remaining loan term 
our debt obligations are generally repurchase agreements of limited duration that are periodically refinanced at current market rates 
adjustable rate mortgage backed assets are typically subject to periodic and lifetime interest rate caps that limit the amount an adjustable rate mortgage backed securities interest rate can change during any given period 
adjustable rate mortgage securities are also typically subject to a minimum interest rate payable 
our borrowings are not subject to similar restrictions 
hence  in a period of increasing interest rates  interest rates on our borrowings could increase without limitation  while the interest rates on our mortgage related assets could be limited 
this problem would be magnified to the extent we acquire mortgage backed securities that are not fully indexed 
further  some adjustable rate mortgage backed securities may be subject to periodic payment caps that result in some portion of the interest being deferred and added to the principal outstanding 
these factors could lower our net interest income or cause a net loss during periods of rising interest rates  which would negatively impact our liquidity  net income and our ability to make distributions to stockholders 
we fund the purchase of a substantial portion of our adjustable rate mortgage backed debt securities with borrowings that have interest rates based on indices and repricing terms similar to  but of somewhat shorter maturities than  the interest rate indices and repricing terms of the mortgage assets 
thus  we anticipate that in most cases the interest rate indices and repricing terms of our mortgage assets and our funding sources will not be identical  thereby creating an interest rate mismatch between assets and liabilities 
during periods of changing interest rates  such interest rate mismatches could negatively impact our net income  dividend yield and the market price of our common stock 
most of our adjustable rate assets are based on the one year constant maturity treasury rate and our debt obligations are generally based on libor 
these indices generally move in parallel  but there can be no assurance that this will continue to occur 
our adjustable rate mortgage backed securities and borrowings reset at various different dates for the specific asset or obligation 
in general  the repricing of our debt obligations occurs more quickly than on our assets 
therefore  on average  our cost of funds may rise or fall more quickly than does our earnings rate on the assets 
further  our net income may vary somewhat as the spread between one month interest rates and six and twelve month interest rates varies 
as of december   our mortgage backed securities and borrowings will prospectively reprice based on the following time frames assets borrowings amount percent of total investments amount percent of total borrowings dollar amounts in thousands investment type rate reset dates fixed rate investments adjustable rate investments obligations less than months greater than months and less than year greater than year and less than years greater than years and less than years greater than years and less than years total market value risk substantially all of our mortgage backed securities and equity securities are classified as available for sale assets 
as such  they are reflected at fair value ie  market value with the adjustment to fair value reflected as part of accumulated other comprehensive income that is included in the equity section of our balance sheet 
the market value of our assets can fluctuate due to changes in interest rates and other factors 
liquidity risk our primary liquidity risk arises from financing long maturity mortgage backed securities with short term debt 
the interest rates on our borrowings generally adjust more frequently than the interest rates on our adjustable rate mortgage backed securities 
for example  at december   our adjustable rate mortgage backed securities had a weighted average term to next rate adjustment of approximately months  while our borrowings had a weighted average term to next rate adjustment of days 
accordingly  in a period of rising interest rates  our borrowing costs will usually increase faster than our interest earnings from mortgage backed securities 
as a result  we could experience a decrease in net income or a net loss during these periods 
our assets that are pledged to secure short term borrowings are high quality  liquid assets 
as a result  we have not had difficulty rolling over our short term debt as it matures 
there can be no assurance that we will always be able to roll over our short term debt 
at december   we had million of debt which could be considered long term debt with a term greater than one year 
at december   we had unrestricted cash of  available to meet margin calls on short term borrowings that could be caused by asset value declines or changes in lender collateralization requirements 
prepayment risk prepayments are the full or partial repayment of principal prior to the original term to maturity of a mortgage loan and typically occur due to refinancing of mortgage loans 
prepayment rates on mortgage related securities vary from time to time and may cause changes in the amount of our net interest income 
prepayments of adjustable rate mortgage loans usually can be expected to increase when mortgage interest rates fall below the then current interest rates on such loans and decrease when mortgage interest rates exceed the then current interest rate on such loans  although such effects are not predictable 
prepayment experience also may be affected by the conditions in the housing and financial markets  general economic conditions  seasonal changes and the relative interest rates on fixed rate and adjustable rate mortgage loans underlying mortgage backed securities 
the purchase prices of mortgage backed securities are generally based upon assumptions regarding the expected amounts and rates of prepayments 
where slow prepayment assumptions are made  we may pay a premium for mortgage backed securities 
to the extent such assumptions differ from the actual amounts of prepayments  we could experience reduced earnings or losses 
the total prepayment of any mortgage backed securities purchased at a premium by us would result in the immediate write off of any remaining capitalized premium amount and a reduction of our net interest income by such amount 
finally  in the event that we are unable to acquire new mortgage backed securities to replace the prepaid mortgage backed securities  our financial condition  cash flows and results of operations could be harmed 
we often purchase mortgage backed securities that have a higher interest rate than the market interest rate at the time 
in exchange for this higher interest rate  we must pay a premium over par value to acquire these securities 
in accordance with accounting rules  we amortize this premium over the term of the mortgage backed security 
as we receive repayments of mortgage principal  we amortize the premium balances as a reduction to our income 
if the mortgage loans underlying a mortgage backed security are prepaid at a faster rate than we anticipate  we would have to amortize the premium at a faster rate 
this would reduce our income 
at december   unamortized mortgage premium balances of mortgage backed securities for financial accounting purposes were million  or of total assets 
tabular presentation the information presented in the table below projects the impact of sudden changes in interest rates on our projected net income and net assets as more fully discussed below based on investments in place on december   and includes all of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
we acquire interest rate sensitive assets and fund them with interest rate sensitive liabilities 
we generally plan to retain such assets and the associated interest rate risk to maturity 
change in interest rate percentage change in net income percentage change in net assets many assumptions are made to present the information in the above table  as such  there can be no assurance that assumed events will occur or that other events will not occur that would affect the outcomes  therefore  the above table and all related disclosure constitutes forward looking statements 
the analysis presented utilizes assumptions and estimates based on management s judgment and experience 
furthermore  future sales  acquisitions and restructuring could materially change our interest rate risk profile 
the table quantifies the potential changes in net income and net asset value should interest rates immediately change are shocked 
the results of interest rate shocks of plus and minus and basis points are presented 
the cash flows associated with the portfolio of mortgage backed securities for each rate shock are calculated based on a variety of assumptions  including prepayment speeds  time until coupon reset  yield on future acquisitions  slope of the yield curve and size of the portfolio 
assumptions made on the interest rate sensitive liabilities  which are repurchase agreements  include anticipated interest rates  collateral requirements as a percent of the repurchase agreement and amount of borrowing 
assumptions made in calculating the impact on net asset value of interest rate shocks include interest rates  prepayment rates and the yield spread of mortgage backed securities relative to prevailing interest rates 
our asset liability structure is generally such that a decrease in interest rates would be expected to result in an increase to net interest income  as our cost of funds are generally shorter term than our interest earning assets 
nevertheless  given the impact of prepayment assumptions and other assumptions coupled with the low level of interest rates at december   the interest rate shocks presented in the above table would cause net income to decrease under each of the interest rate shock scenarios presented 
when interest rates are shocked  prepayment assumptions are adjusted based on management s best estimate of the effects of changes in interest rates on prepayment speeds 
for example  under current market conditions  a basis point decline in interest rates is estimated to result in a increase in the prepayment rate of our mortgage backed securities portfolio 
the base interest rate scenario assumes interest rates at december  actual results could differ significantly from those estimated in the table 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in may  the fasb issued financial accounting standards no 
accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity in an effort to establish standards for classification and measurements of those financial instruments 
it requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument within its scope as a liability 
many of those instruments  as stated in fas  were previously classified as equity 
this statement is effective at the beginning of the first interim period commencing after june  the provisions of fas should did not have a material effect on the company s financial statements 
on july   the company adopted sfas no  amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
sfas amends and clarifies accounting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
in particular  this sfas clarifies under what circumstances a contract with an initial net investment meets the characteristic of a derivative and when a derivative contains a financing component that warrants special reporting in the statement of cash flows 
this statement is generally effective for contracts entered into or modified after june  and did not have an impact on the company s financial statements  as no such contracts were entered into during this period
