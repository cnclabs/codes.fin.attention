management s focus on shifting product mix away from traditional lumber building materials continues and has been the reason for increased sales in recent years 
we continued to experience a decrease in sales in the area of lumber and building materials that management believes is due to recessionary conditions in the economy causing customers to scale back their purchases of these discretionary items 
the loss of revenue from these products has been offset by the sales increases in our other business segments  however  we believe that once consumer confidence strengthens  lumber and building material sales will again trend upward 
we have also introduced new products for retailers  which  in the past  concentrated on more expensive items

management anticipates beginning the offering in december with completion in early the company is under no legal or business requirement to take these actions 
based on the company s current working capital position  its policy of retaining earnings  and the line of credit available  we have adequate working capital to meet our needs in the foreseeable future 
rather  management is undertaking this for strategic purposes 
management anticipates using the proceeds of the offering to pay down corporate indebtedness  including notes payable 
management believes that the company does not need to retire its long term debt to continue to grow at its current rate 
by retiring this debt  the company will have the option to purchase other businesses in its industry  thus allowing the company to accelerate its growth rate 
the company s bank debt was  at the actual interest rate on this debt  as of  was and it floats at prime 
this is a renewable line of credit with us bank and the loan is up for renewal on credit risks financial instruments that potentially subject the company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable 
the company places its cash and cash equivalents with high quality financial institutions and limits the amount of credit exposure with any one institution 
the company has concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable as large amounts of its accounts receivable are concentrated geographically in the united states amongst a small number of customers 
at and  no customers accounted for accounts receivable greater than of total accounts receivable 
the company controls credit risk through credit approvals  credit limits  and monitoring procedures

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the company did not have any derivative financial instruments as of the company s interest income and expense are most sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates 
therefore  changes in us interest rates affect the interest earned on the company s cash equivalents as well as interest paid on debt 
the company has lines of credit and other debt whose interest rates are based on various published prime rates that may fluctuate over time based on economic changes in the environment 
the company is subject to interest rate risk and could be subject to increased interest payments if market interest rates fluctuate 
the company does not expect any change in the interest rates to have a material adverse effect on the company s results from operations 
foreign currency risk the company operates primarily in the united states  however  some business is transacted with canadian firms 
the company s business and financial condition is  therefore  sensitive to currency exchange rates or any other restrictions imposed on its currency
