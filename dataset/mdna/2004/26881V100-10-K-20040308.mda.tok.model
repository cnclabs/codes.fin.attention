overview we were founded in november and were primarily engaged in research and development activities until early when we shipped our first software product and generated our first revenues from software license  professional services and maintenance fees 
in september and january  we raised a total of approximately million through the sale of our common stock in registered public offerings to fund growth and to acquire complementary businesses and technologies 
during and  we completed several acquisitions in exchange for our stock consideration including the acquisitions of rightpoint software  inc  octane software  inc 
and moss software  inc these acquisitions increased our customer base  increased the number of our employees and expanded our product suite 
as a result of these acquisitions  we recorded goodwill and purchased intangible assets of approximately billion  representing the difference between the value of the consideration paid in our stock and the value of the net assets acquired 
from the shipment of our first software product in early through the fourth quarter of  our revenues increased steadily each quarter due primarily to the market acceptance and success of our products such as e 
piphany insight and e 
piphany marketing  as well as the shipment of new products such as e 
piphany service  which were introduced through a combination of acquisitions and internal development 
our annual revenues grew to million in from million in and million in during and  the worldwide economy weakened and a slowdown in technology spending by businesses occurred 
as a result  our revenues declined from million in to million in and to million in during this period of economic slowdown  we initiated restructuring plans to reduce our workforce and consolidate our operating facilities 
we also reviewed the impact of the change in market conditions on the carrying value of our goodwill and intangible assets 
we determined that these assets were impaired and wrote down their fair value by recording a non cash charge of billion in september net losses for the years ended december   and were million  billion and million  respectively 
the net losses in and included non cash impairment and amortization of goodwill and purchased intangibles of million and billion  respectively 
during  we released version of our product suite 
this release generated an increase in demand for our product licenses which helped increase revenues in our total revenues for increased to million  an increase of over  while our product license revenues increased to million in from million in  an increase of year over year 
during  we continued to focus on cost containment and reduced our annual net loss to million in from million in the prior year 
the combination of increased revenue and decreased costs resulted in declining net losses in the first three quarters of the year and net income of million in the fourth quarter 
sources of revenue we generate revenues principally from licensing our software products directly to customers and providing related services including implementation  professional  maintenance and training services 
through december   substantially all of our revenues were generated by our direct sales force 
our license agreements generally provide that customers pay a software license fee to perpetually use one or more software products within specified limits 
the amount of the license fee varies depending on which software products are purchased  the number of software products purchased and the scope of usage rights 
customers can subsequently pay additional license fees to expand the right to use previously licensed software products  or to purchase additional software products 
our software products are made available to our customers electronically via internet download or on compact disk 
customers generally require consulting and implementation services  which include evaluating their business needs  identifying the data sources necessary to meet these needs and installing the software solution in a manner that fulfills their requirements 
customers can purchase these services directly from third party consulting organizations  such as accenture  bearingpoint formerly kpmg consulting  deloitte consulting  eloyalty or ibm 
alternatively  in certain circumstances  customers can purchase these services directly from us through our internal professional services organization 
consulting and implementation services are generally sold to customers on a time and expense basis 
we have also historically supplemented the capacity of our internal professional services organization by subcontracting some of these services to third party consulting organizations 
cost of revenues and operating expenses cost of revenues includes the cost of product license revenues  the cost of services revenues and the amortization of purchased technology 
our cost of product license revenues primarily consists of license fees payable to third parties for technology integrated into our products 
our cost of services revenues primarily consists of salaries and related expenses for our professional services  maintenance and training organizations  an allocation of facilities  information technology and depreciation expenses  as well as the cost of reimbursable expenses and the cost of subcontracting professional services from third party consulting organizations that provide consulting and implementation services to our customers 
cost of revenues also includes the amortization of purchased technology arising from our acquisitions 
our operating expenses are classified into three general categories sales and marketing  research and development  and general and administrative 
we classify all charges to these operating expense categories based on the nature of the expenditures 
we allocate the costs for overhead and facilities to each of the functional areas that use the overhead and facilities services based on headcount 
these allocated charges include facilities  information technology  communications and depreciation expenses 
software development costs incurred prior to the establishment of technological feasibility are included in research and development costs as they are incurred 
since license revenues from our software solutions are not recognized until after technological feasibility has been established  software development costs are not generally expensed in the same period in which license revenues for the developed products are recognized 
critical accounting policies and estimates accounting policies  methods and estimates are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements prepared by management and are based upon management s current judgments 
those judgments are based on knowledge and experience with regard to past and current events and assumptions about future events 
certain accounting policies  methods and estimates are particularly sensitive because of their significance to the financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting them may differ markedly from management s current judgments 
while there are a number of accounting policies  methods and estimates affecting our financial statements  areas that are particularly significant and subject to the exercise of judgment include revenue recognition policies  allowances for doubtful accounts  the measurement and recoverability of goodwill and purchased intangible assets  restructuring accruals for the abandonment of certain leased facilities  and stock based compensation 
these policies and our practices related to these policies are described below and in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles which have been prescribed for the software industry and we follow detailed guidelines discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the accounting rules related to revenue recognition are complex and are affected by interpretations of the rules and an understanding of industry practices  both of which are subject to change 
consequently  the revenue recognition accounting rules require management to make significant judgments 
we do not record revenue on sales transactions when collectability is in doubt at the time of sale 
rather  revenue is recognized from these transactions as cash is collected 
the determination of collectability requires significant judgment 
to date  when we have been primarily responsible for the implementation of the software under a customer contract  both product license revenues and service revenues are recognized under the percentage of completion contract method in accordance with the provisions of statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts sop 
this is based on our assessment that the implementation services for these arrangements are essential to the functionality of our software 
throughout most of the three years ended december   third party consulting organizations have been primarily responsible for implementation services for the majority of our license arrangements 
this trend reversed temporarily during the second half of and during this time we were responsible for the implementation on the majority of contracts 
this temporary change resulted in a greater percentage of revenue being recognized under sop in the second half of and the first half of approximately  and of license revenue was recognized under sop during  and  respectively 
we estimate the percentage of completion on contracts utilizing hours incurred to date as a percentage of the total estimated hours to complete the project 
the percentage of completion method of accounting involves an estimation process and is subject to risks and uncertainties inherent in projecting future events 
a number of internal and external factors can affect our estimates  including the nature of the services being performed  the complexity of the customer s information technology environment and the utilization and efficiency of our professional services employees 
recognized revenues and profit are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion 
revisions in profit estimates are charged to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
allowances for doubtful accounts a considerable amount of judgment is required when we assess the realization of receivables  including assessing the probability of collection and the current creditworthiness of each customer 
when we believe a collectability issue exists with respect to a specific receivable  we record an allowance to reduce that receivable to the amount that we believe is collectable 
for all other receivables  we record an allowance based on an assessment of the aging of such receivables  our historical experience with bad debts and the general economic environment 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required that would result in additional general and administrative expense in the period such determination is made 
acquisitions  goodwill and purchased intangible assets we record goodwill and purchased intangible assets when we acquire other companies 
the cost of the acquisition is allocated to the assets and liabilities acquired  including purchased intangible assets  and the remaining amount is classified as goodwill 
certain purchased intangible assets such as purchased technology and customer lists are amortized to cost of revenues and operating expense over time  while in process research and development is recorded as a one time charge on the acquisition date 
under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  which became effective on july   goodwill arising from transactions occurring after july  and any existing goodwill as of january  are not amortized to expense  but rather periodically assessed for impairment 
the allocation of the acquisition cost to purchased intangible assets and goodwill  therefore  has a significant impact on our operating results 
the allocation process involves an extensive use of estimates and assumptions  including estimates of future cash flows to be generated by the acquired assets 
as a result of the adoption of sfas as of january   we ceased amortization of approximately million of goodwill 
in lieu of amortization  we were required to perform a transitional impairment test of goodwill 
further  we perform impairment tests annually or when impairment indicators are identified with respect to previously recorded intangible assets 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair market value 
fair market value is determined by independent valuation experts using  among other things  discounted future cash flow techniques 
estimating discounted future cash flows requires significant management judgment concerning revenue  profitability and discount rates 
differences between forecasted and actual results as well as changes in the general economic environment could result in material write downs of goodwill and purchased intangible assets 
we performed the transitional impairment test on january  and annual impairment tests on december  and we determined that no impairment existed at those times 
restructuring charges as discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  we have recorded significant restructuring charges  primarily in connection with our abandonment of certain leased facilities 
the lease abandonment costs were estimated to include remaining lease liabilities and brokerage fees offset by estimated sublease income 
estimates related to sublease costs and income are based on assumptions regarding the period required to sublease the facilities and the likely sublease rates 
these estimates are based on market trend information analyses provided by commercial real estate brokerage firms retained by us 
we review these estimates each reporting period and  to the extent that market conditions and our assumptions change  adjustments to the restructuring accrual are recorded 
if the real estate market continues to worsen and we are not able to sublease the properties as early as  or at the rates estimated  the accrual will be increased  which would result in additional restructuring costs in the period in which such determination is made 
if the real estate market strengthens and we are able to sublease the properties earlier or at more favorable rates than projected  the accrual may be decreased  which would increase net income in the period in which such determination is made 
the accrued liability of million at december  is net of million of estimated sublease income 
sublease income is comprised of future minimum sublease payments as well as the reimbursement of future expected operating expenses 
of this total sublease income  million represents future sublease income due under non cancelable subleases and million represents our estimates of future sublease income on excess facilities we expect to sublease in the future 
future expected payments of lease costs net of expected sublease receipts which have been included in our accrued restructuring costs are as follows in thousands year ended december  lease costs and thereafter stock based compensation we elect to account for compensation expense related to stock options issued to employees in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
under apb  compensation expense for fixed stock options is based on the difference between the market value of our stock and the exercise price of the option on the date of grant  if any 
this election is available to companies under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
had we elected to apply the fair value method for valuing stock options under sfas  our net loss and net loss per share would have been substantially higher as discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the fair value method of option valuation was applied for disclosure purposes by utilizing the black scholes option pricing model 
this option pricing model is commonly used by companies to calculate the fair value of options under sfas and utilizes certain variables including the exercise price of the option  expected life of the option  the market value of the underlying stock as of the grant date  the expected volatility of the underlying stock during the life of the option  and a risk free interest rate of return 
although some of these variables are known at the date of grant  other variables are based on estimates of future events 
changes in these estimates may have a material impact on the compensation expense calculated under the fair value method 
for example  an increase in the estimated expected life of the option or the stock volatility would increase the fair market value of the option and result in an increase to compensation expense calculated under the fair value method 
results of operations revenues the following table sets forth our revenues  both in absolute dollars and expressed as a percentage of total revenues  for the years ended december   and in thousands  except percentages years ended december  revenues product license services the following table sets forth our revenues by geography  both in absolute dollars and expressed as a percentage of total revenues  for the years ended december   and in thousands  except percentages years ended december  north america europe rest of world total revenues for increased by million  or  over total revenues for excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations  the increase was approximately 
these foreign currency fluctuations were a result of sales recorded in foreign currencies  particularly the british pound and the euro  which were stronger relative to the us dollar during compared to total revenues for decreased by million  or  as compared with total revenues for foreign currency fluctuations did not have a material impact on the change in revenues from to product license revenues for increased by million  or  over product license revenues for as a percentage of total revenues  product license revenues increased to in from in following the release of e 
in september  we sold several licenses for which we were responsible for the implementation of the software 
the revenue on these transactions was recognized using the percentage of completion method under sop and contributed to the increase in revenues in compared to the increase in product license revenues was also the result of an increase in the total number of product license sales 
specifically  we increased our focus on our primary geographies  north america and europe  and on product markets we believe are important to our future revenue growth 
during  markets outside of north america and europe were transitioned to an indirect sales model under our restructuring plan to reduce sales and marketing costs 
as a result  product license sales in regions outside of north america and europe decreased compared to however  these decreases were more than offset by increases in product license sales in north america and europe 
product license revenues decreased in from due to fewer sales resulting primarily from the downturn in the economy and weakness in information technology spending 
services revenues consist of revenue from professional services  maintenance and training services 
services revenues for increased by million  or  over the increase was primarily due to an increase in maintenance revenues offset  in part  by a decrease in professional services revenues 
the increase in maintenance revenues was attributable to maintenance contracts sold with new licenses in addition to maintenance agreement renewals by our existing installed base 
the decrease in professional services revenues was attributable to more of our customers contracting directly with third party integrators 
services revenues for decreased from due primarily to a decrease in professional services revenues offset  in part  by an increase in maintenance revenue attributable to maintenance contracts sold to our new customers 
the decrease in professional services was primarily the result of fewer services rendered due to a decrease in product sales 
the relative amount of services revenues as compared to license revenues has varied historically depending on the extent to which third party consulting organizations have been engaged directly by customers to provide professional services  the nature of products licensed  the complexity of our customers information technology environment  the resources allocated by customers to implementation projects and the scope of licensed rights 
services revenues have substantially lower margins than product license revenues 
this is especially true when we are required to subcontract with consulting organizations to supplement our internal professional services organization 
to the extent that services revenues become a greater percentage of our total revenues  our overall gross margins will decline 
deferred revenue decreased to million as of december  from million as of december  this balance consists of fees collected from customers for which revenue has not been recognized 
deferred revenue fluctuates due to several factors and is  therefore  not a reliable indicator of future revenues 
these factors include the timing of collections from customers  the variation in the amount of revenue recognized under sop and the timing of customer renewals for annual maintenance agreements 
all of these factors contributed to the decline in deferred revenue compared to prior year 
cost of revenues the following table sets forth our cost of revenues and gross profit  both in absolute dollars and expressed as a percentage of total revenues  for the years ended december   and in thousands  except percentages years ended december  cost of revenues product license services amortization of purchased technology gross profit the cost of revenues decreased in from due primarily to a decrease in the amortization of purchased technology and a decrease in the cost of services revenues 
cost of product license revenues consists primarily of license fees paid to third parties under technology license arrangements and  as a percentage of license revenues  has not been significant to date 
cost of services revenues consist primarily of personnel and related costs of providing professional services  maintenance and training services 
the decrease in cost of services revenues for and was due primarily to a reduction in the number of internal professional services employees and the related overhead and facilities costs resulting from the restructuring of our operations 
the number of services employees decreased from at december  to at december  to at december  of this total reduction  related to the restructuring of our operations during  related to the restructuring of our operations during and the remainder related to voluntary and other terminations 
the decrease in cost of services revenues as a percentage of revenues for and was due to the decrease in the number of services employees as well as an increase in the proportion of maintenance revenues to services revenues 
maintenance revenues have more favorable margins than professional services and training revenue 
the amortization of purchased technology consists of amortization from technology purchased in the acquisitions of rightpoint  octane  ileverage  eclass direct  moss and certain intellectual property assets of radnet 
the decrease in amortization of purchased technology from to was due to the full amortization of rightpoint  octane and eclass direct assets during the decrease in amortization from to was primarily due to a write down of the carrying value of the assets during the third quarter of see discussion of amortization and write down of goodwill and purchased intangibles below 
purchased technology assets of million are included in purchased intangibles on our consolidated balance sheet and are being amortized on a straight line basis over their remaining useful lives 
all purchased technology assets are expected to be fully amortized by march  operating expenses research and development the following table sets forth our research and development expenses for the years ended december   and  expressed both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenues in thousands  except percentages years ended december  research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel and related costs associated with our product development efforts 
the decrease from to was due primarily to a reduction of facilities and overhead expenses 
in addition  a reduction in localization costs related to the japan market was offset  in part  by an increase in consulting expenses related to the use of more overseas development resources 
similar to the decrease from to  the decrease from to was due to the restructuring of our operations  which resulted in lower overhead and facilities costs 
the number of research and development employees decreased from as of december  to as of december  to as of december  of the total decrease  related to the restructuring of our operations during and the remainder related to voluntary and other terminations 
no research and development employees were terminated as a result of restructuring activities in we believe that investments in product development are essential to our future success and  therefore  the cost reductions we implemented in did not reduce our research and development expenses as much as other expense items 
we anticipate that research and development expenses will increase over the long term in absolute dollars 
sales and marketing the following table sets forth our sales and marketing expenses for the years ended december   and  expressed both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenues in thousands  except percentages years ended december  sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of employee salaries  benefits and commissions  and the costs of trade shows  seminars  promotional materials and other sales and marketing programs 
the decreases in and were primarily due to a reduction in the number of sales and marketing employees and lower overhead and facilities costs as a result of our restructuring plans 
the decreases were also due to lower spending on sales and marketing programs 
the number of sales and marketing employees decreased from as of december  to as of december  to as of december  of the total reduction  related to the restructuring of our operations in  related to the restructuring of our operations in and the remainder related to voluntary and other terminations 
general and administrative the following table sets forth our general and administrative expenses for the years ended december   and  expressed both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenues in thousands  except percentages years ended december  general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee salaries and related expenses for executive  finance  legal and administrative personnel 
the decreases in and were primarily due to a reduction in the number of general and administrative employees and lower overhead and facilities costs as a result of our restructuring plans 
the number of general and administrative employees decreased from as of december  to at december  to at december  of this reduction  related to the restructuring of our operations in  related to the restructuring of our operations in and the remainder related to voluntary and other terminations 
the decrease from to was also due to a reduction in spending on external legal services 
the decrease from to was also due to a decrease in bad debt expense due to an increase in collection rates 
restructuring costs the following table sets forth our restructuring charges for the years ended december   and  expressed both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenues in thousands  except percentages years ended december  restructuring charges in the quarter ended september  we began restructuring worldwide operations to reduce costs and improve efficiencies in response to a slower economic environment 
since that time  operations have been streamlined  sales models have changed in certain geographies and facilities have been abandoned to align our cost structure to current market conditions 
in accordance with applicable accounting literature  specified activities are deemed the commencement of a separate restructuring plan in the quarter in which those activities could be specifically identified 
the first plan was initiated in the quarter ended september  plan 
the second plan  initiated during the quarter ended june   consisted of actions which were primarily supplemental to plan plan and a third plan was initiated during the quarter ended march  plan 
charges for these plans were based on assumptions and related estimates that were appropriate for the economic environment that existed at the time these charges were recorded 
however  due to the continued deterioration of the commercial real estate market  primarily in the us and the united kingdom  we have made subsequent adjustments to the initial restructuring charges 
no significant adjustments have been made to the initial estimated severance charges 
see note in notes to consolidated financial statements for more details 
amortization and write down of goodwill and purchased intangibles the following table sets forth our amortization of goodwill and purchased intangibles for the years ended december   and  expressed both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenues in thousands  except percentages years ended december  amortization of goodwill and purchased intangibles our acquisitions of octane  eclass direct  ileverage and rightpoint in and the acquisitions of moss and certain intellectual property assets of radnet in were accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
accordingly  we recorded intangible assets and goodwill representing the excess of the purchase price paid over the fair value of net assets acquired 
the decrease in amortization of goodwill and purchased intangibles in compared to was due to the cessation of the amortization of goodwill in accordance with sfas and to a billion charge for the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets recorded in the year ended december  the decrease in amortization in compared to was due to the full amortization of purchased intangibles related to the rightpoint and octane acquisitions 
we will continue to amortize purchased intangible assets of million on a straight line basis over their remaining useful lives 
this balance is comprised entirely of purchased technology assets as of december  related amortization expense will be recorded in cost of revenues and the asset will be fully amortized by march  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for more detailed information 
stock based compensation the following table sets forth our stock based compensation expenses for the years ended december   and  expressed both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenues in thousands  except percentages years ended december  stock based compensation stock based compensation consists of amortization of deferred compensation in connection with stock option grants to employees at exercise prices below the deemed fair market value of our common stock at the date of grant 
this amount is being amortized over the respective vesting periods of these equity instruments in a manner consistent with financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
as of december   the deferred compensation balance was fully amortized 
see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding the accounting treatment for stock based compensation 
we account for stock issued to employees in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
apb  accounting for stock issued to employees and comply with the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
sfas  accounting for stock based compensation and sfas no 
sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
under apb  compensation expense for fixed stock options is based on the difference between the fair market value of our stock and the exercise price of the option on the date of grant  if any 
had we recognized stock based compensation expense under sfas  our stock based compensation expense would have been million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
other income  net the following table sets forth our other income  net for the years ended december   and  expressed both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenues in thousands  except percentages years ended december  other income  net the decreases in and were due to decreases in interest income resulting primarily from decreases in the average rate of return on our investments 
interest income also declined in and as a result of lower average cash and investment balances 
the decrease from to was offset  in part  by million of other income recorded in  which reflected the termination of a partner agreement executed in october by one of the companies that we acquired 
provision for taxes the following table sets forth our provision for taxes for the years ended december   and  expressed both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenues in thousands  except percentages years ended december  provision for taxes provision for taxes consists of withholding taxes due on payments from certain foreign customers 
from inception through december   we incurred net losses for federal and state tax purposes and have not recognized any income tax provision or benefit 
due to uncertainties regarding realization of any deferred tax assets based on our limited operating history  the lack of annual profitability to date  and the uncertainty of future profitability  we have a valuation allowance equal to the total deferred tax assets of million as of december  and therefore have no net deferred tax assets 
liquidity and capital resources cash flow as of december   our primary sources of liquidity consisted of million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and million in long term investments for a total of million in cash and investments 
long term investments generally consist of securities that we intend to hold for more than one year with maturity dates of less than two years from the date of purchase 
net cash used in operating activities totaled million in and is a decrease from the million used in and million used in the decrease in cash used in operations is primarily due to a reduction in our net loss adjusted for non cash charges such as the amortization of purchased technology and depreciation 
our net loss decreased primarily due to the restructuring of our operations and our continued focus on cost control as well as an increase in revenue 
net cash used in operating activities in decreased from due primarily to a reduction in our net loss adjusted for non cash charges such as the write down and amortization of goodwill and purchased intangibles 
in addition  during we recorded an accrual for restructuring costs which offset our use of cash from our net loss by million 
we expect to incur significant operating expenses  particularly research and development and sales and marketing expenses  for the foreseeable future in order to execute our business plan 
we anticipate that such operating expenses will comprise a material expenditure of our current cash resources 
as a result  our net operating cash flows will depend on the level of future revenues and our ability to effectively manage costs 
net cash used in investing activities totaled million for compared to net cash provided by investing activities of million in and net cash provided by investing activities of million in cash used in investing activities during resulted primarily from the net movement from investments to cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of funding operating activities 
cash provided by investing activities in and resulted primarily from the maturities of investments 
investments purchased are primarily comprised of government sponsored enterprises  auction rate municipal securities and corporate debt securities with maturities which do not exceed months 
to a lesser extent  cash was used in each of the three years ending december  for the purchase of property and equipment 
net cash provided by financing activities totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
cash provided by financing activities for each period resulted from the receipt of proceeds from the issuance of common stock pursuant to the exercise of stock options and our employee stock purchase plan 
restricted cash from time to time  we are required to obtain letters of credit that serve as collateral for our obligations to third parties under facility lease agreements 
these letters of credit are secured by cash and cash equivalents and are recorded as restricted cash in the balance sheet 
as of december   we had million of restricted cash  million of which are classified as short term and relate to facility lease agreements that have expiration dates in  and million of which are classified as long term and relate to facility lease agreements that have expiration dates greater than twelve months from december  contractual obligations our contractual obligations as of december  are comprised of operating leases  purchase obligations and long term liabilities operating leases 
we lease certain facilities under operating lease agreements which expire at various dates through in addition  we receive sublease income from non cancelable subleases of excess facilities 
future minimum lease payments due and receivable under these leases as of december  were as follows in thousands year ending december  operating leases due sublease income receivable total  net and thereafter net operating lease commitments shown above include million of operating lease commitments under leases for abandoned facilities which are recorded as restructuring costs in the accompanying balance sheet as of december  we do not have commercial commitments under lines of credit  standby lines of credit  guarantees  standby repurchase obligations or other such arrangements 
purchase obligations 
our purchase obligations are comprised primarily of agreements for the minimum purchase of telecommunications services and other miscellaneous marketing and consulting services 
these commitments total less than million in and less than million in long term liabilities 
as of december  we have long term liabilities of less than million 
these amounts are payable primarily during or later 
we believe that our cash  cash equivalents and investment balances will be sufficient to meet our anticipated liquidity needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least months 
if we require additional capital resources to grow our business internally or to acquire complementary technologies and businesses at any time in the future  we may seek to liquidate our long term investments  issue additional equity or debt securities or secure a bank line of credit 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
we cannot assure you that any financing arrangements will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us in the future 
off balance sheet arrangements we generally agree to indemnify our customers against legal claims that our software products infringe certain third party intellectual property rights and account for our indemnification obligations under sfas no 
in the event of such a claim  we are generally obligated to defend our customer against the claim and to either settle the claim at our expense or pay damages that the customer is legally required to pay to the third party claimant 
in addition  in the event of an infringement  we agree to modify or replace the infringing product  or  if those options are not reasonably possible  to refund the cost of the software  as pro rated over a five year period 
to date  we have not been required to make any payment resulting from infringement claims asserted against our customers 
as such  we have not provided for an infringement accrual as of december  or december  and have not deferred revenue recognition on license agreements which provide for a pro rated refund over a five year period 
during the quarter ended september   we sold all of the outstanding capital stock of its japanese subsidiary  e 
piphany software  kk e 
piphany japan  to braxton ltd 
for approximately million in cash 
the stock purchase agreement contained customary representations  warranties and covenants of the parties  including covenants to indemnify each other in the event of a breach of warranty or representation 
claims under the indemnification covenants may be submitted within months  and others within two years  from the date of closing  for a maximum of million  and only to the extent that losses exceed of the purchase price 
the fair value of these indemnification provisions were not material to our financial position  results of operations or cash flows for the year ended december  we indemnify our directors and officers in their capacity as such 
to date  we have not been required to make any payment resulting from these indemnification obligations 
additionally  the fair value of these indemnification provisions was not material to our financial position  results of operations or cash flows for the year ended december  recent accounting pronouncements accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables in november  the eitf reached a consensus on issue no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discusses our exposure to market risk related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results could vary materially as a result of a number of factors including those set forth in the risk factors section of this annual report on form k 
foreign currency exchange rate risk the majority of our operations are based in the united states and  accordingly  the majority of our transactions are denominated in us dollars 
we do have foreign based operations  however  where transactions are denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to market risk with respect to fluctuations in the relative value of currencies 
as of december   we had international operations in asia  australia  europe  canada and latin america and conduct transactions in the local currency of each location 
historically  our exposure to fluctuations in the relative value of other currencies has been limited because substantially all of our assets are denominated in us dollars  and those assets which are not denominated in us dollars have generally been denominated in historically stable currencies 
the impact to our cash and investment balances has therefore not been material 
currency transaction gains or losses  derived on monetary assets and liabilities stated in a currency other than the functional currency  are recognized in current operations and have not been significant to our operating results in any period 
to date  we have not entered into any foreign exchange hedges or other derivative financial instruments 
we will continue to evaluate our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk on a regular basis 
interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates primarily affects our investment portfolio 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
this is accomplished by investing in diversified investments  consisting only of investment grade securities 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
as of december   we held million in cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash consisting of highly liquid short term investments having original maturity dates of no more than days 
declines of interest rates over time would reduce our interest income from our highly liquid short term investments 
based upon our balance of cash and cash equivalents  a decrease in interest rates of basis points would cause a corresponding decrease in our annual interest income by million 
due to the nature of our highly liquid cash equivalents  a change in interest rates would not materially change the fair market value of our cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash 
as of december   we held million in short term investments and long term investments  each of which consisted of taxable fixed income securities having original maturity dates between three months and two years 
a decline in interest rates over time would reduce our interest income from our short term investments and long term investments 
a decrease in interest rates of basis points would cause a corresponding decrease in our annual interest income of approximately million 
an increase in interest rates over time would cause the fair market value of our portfolio to decline 
an immediate and uniform increase in interest rates of basis points would cause the fair market value of these items to decrease by approximately million 
as of december   we did not have any outstanding debt 
the following summarizes our investments  weighted average yields and expected maturity dates as of december  in thousands  except interest rates thereafter total commercial paper weighted average yield corporate bonds weighted average yield government notes bonds weighted average yield auction rate securities weighted average yield total investment securities government notes bonds consists primarily of government sponsored enterprises and includes  to a lesser extent  investments in taxable municipal bonds 
auction rate securities consist primarily of taxable municipal bonds having reset dates of less than days 
a significant portion of our short term investments consist of these instruments as they typically provide a higher rate of return than money market funds while maintaining a low level of risk and a high degree of liquidity
