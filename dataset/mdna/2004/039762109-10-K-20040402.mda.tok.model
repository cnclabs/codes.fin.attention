results of operations compared to the results of operations for the weeks ended january  compared to the weeks ended december  reflects the pervasive impact of a labor dispute in the company s trade area that commenced october  and concluded february  the collective bargaining agreement covering the majority of the company s employees  as well as other participating employers in southern california  expired on october  on october   the ufcw declared a strike against vons and in turn  albertsons and ralphs locked out their ufcw employees 
on february   the ufcw announced that employees of these three major grocery retailers ratified a new contract thereby ending the labor dispute 
prior to the labor dispute the company had agreed with the ufcw to continue operating under a contract extension and to agree to be bound by all modifications regarding trust funds and hourly wage rates as negotiated between the ufcw and the three major grocery retailers 
in return  the ufcw agreed not to strike the company 
gelson s remained open  its employees elected not to strike the company 
in a vote held on march   employees of the company who are members of the ufcw ratified a new labor contract on terms similar to those reached by the three major grocery retailers 
the new labor contract expires in march the labor dispute resulted in a temporary shift in consumer shopping patterns as many customers of the three major grocery retailers chose to shop at other grocery retailers 
this shift in consumer shopping patterns resulted in a significant increase in the company s sales and operating income during the fourth quarter of and first quarter of the company anticipates that with the february contract settlement most former customers of the three major grocery retailers will in time return to their previous shopping patterns but that the company s post strike sales will be somewhat greater than comparable pre strike levels as a result of the retention of some of the new shoppers that came to gelson s during the labor dispute

management has established accounting policies that they believe are appropriate in order to reflect the accurate reporting of the company s operating results  financial position and cash flows 
the company applies these accounting policies in a consistent manner 
management bases their estimates on historical experience  current and expected economic conditions and various other factors that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates and assumptions form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the company reevaluates these significant factors and makes adjustments where facts and circumstances dictate 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty  and therefore actual results may differ from estimates 
management believes that the following accounting policies are the most critical in the preparation of the company s financial statements because they involve the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
investments investments are accounted for under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
management determines the appropriate classification of its investments in marketable securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such determination at each balance sheet date

perishable inventories are valued at the lower of cost on a first in  first out fifo method or market

impairment is determined by comparing projected undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset to its carrying value 
if impairment is identified  a loss would be recorded equal to the excess of the asset s net book value over the asset s fair value 
workers compensation and general and auto liability insurance the company is primarily self insured for losses related to workers compensation and general and auto liability claims 
the company purchases stop loss coverage to limit its loss exposure on a per claim basis

discounts given to customers are recorded at the point of sale as a reduction of revenues 
the company maintains a bad debt allowance for receivables from vendors and gelson s credit card sales

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s the company currently has no bank debt or fixture financing 
if the company should obtain financing or draw on its existing lines of credit  which bear interest at the bank s reference rate or the bank s adjusted libor rate plus an index up to  the company could then be exposed to market risk related to interest fluctuations 
a change in market prices exposes the company to market risk related to its investments which totaled  as of january  a hypothetical drop in the market value of these investments would result in a  unrealized loss and a corresponding decrease in the fair value of these instruments 
this hypothetical drop would not affect cash flow and would not have an impact on earnings until the company sold the investments
