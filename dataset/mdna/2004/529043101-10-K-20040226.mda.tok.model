item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company  which has elected to qualify as a real estate investment trust under the internal revenue code of  acquires and manages net leased commercial properties throughout the united states 
the company has operated as a reit since october as of december   the company owned or had interests in real estate properties encompassing million rentable square feet 
during  the company purchased properties  including non consolidated investments  for million 
during  the company sold four properties for net proceeds of million  which resulted in an aggregate gain of million 
in addition  the company contributed properties to the lion joint venture  clarion paid the company directly million for their proportionate ownership interest 
as of december   the company leased properties to tenants in different industries and the weighted average lease term based upon annualized rental revenue is years 
the company s revenues and cash flows are generated predominantly from property rent receipts 
growth in revenue and cash flows is directly correlated to the company s ability to i acquire income producing properties and ii to release properties that are vacant  or may become vacant  at favorable rental rates 
the challenge the company faces in purchasing properties is finding investments that will provide an attractive return without compromising the company s real estate underwriting criteria 
the company believes it has access to acquisition opportunities due to its relationship with developers  brokers  corporate users and sellers 
in the past three years  the company has experienced minimal lease turnover  and accordingly minimal capital expenditures 
there can be no assurance that this will continue 
through the company has leases expiring which generate approximately million in rental revenue 
releasing these properties at favorable effective rates is the primary focus of the company 
the primary risks associated with re tenanting properties are i the period of time required to find a new tenant ii whether rental rates will be lower than previously received iii the significant leasing costs such as commissions and tenant improvement allowances and iv the payment of operating costs such as real estate taxes and insurance while there is no offsetting revenue 
the company addresses these risks by contacting tenants well in advance of lease maturity to get an understanding of their occupancy needs  contacting local brokers to determine the depth of the rental market and  if required  retaining local expertise to assist in the re tenanting of a property 
as part of the acquisition underwriting process  the company focuses on buying general purpose real estate which can be leased to other tenants without significant modification to the properties 
no assurance can be given that once a property becomes vacant it will subsequently be re let 
during  the company sold properties including a interest in a property and one building in the palm beach gardens  florida property for million  which resulted in an aggregate gain of approximately million 
during  the company sold one property for million which approximated book value 
critical accounting policies the company s accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require management to make estimates that affect the amounts of revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities reported 
the following are critical accounting policies which are important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and which require some of management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments 
the accounting for these matters involves the making of estimates based on current facts  circumstances and assumptions which could change in a manner that would materially affect management s future estimate with respect to such matters 
accordingly  future reported financial conditions and results could differ materially from financial conditions and results reported based on management s current estimates 
revenue recognition 
the company recognizes revenue in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for leases sfas no 

sfas no 
requires that revenue be recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the lease unless another systematic and rational basis is more representative of the time pattern in which the use benefit is derived from the leased property 
gains on sales of real estate are recognized pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
accounting for sales of real estate 
the specific timing of the sale is measured against various criteria in sfas no 
related to the terms of the transactions and any continuing involvement in the form of management or financial assistance associated with the properties 
if the sales criteria are not met  the gain is deferred and the finance  installment or cost recovery method  as appropriate  is applied until the sales criteria are met 
accounts receivable 
the company continuously monitors collections from its tenants and would make a provision for estimated losses based upon historical experience and any specific tenant collection issues that the company has identified 
purchase accounting for acquisition of real estate 
the fair value of the real estate acquired is allocated to the acquired tangible assets  consisting of land  building and improvements  and identified intangible assets and liabilities  consisting of the value of above market and below market leases  other value of in place leases and value of tenant relationships  based in each case on their fair values 
the fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property which includes land  building and improvements is determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant  and the as if vacant value is then allocated to land  building and improvements based on management s determination of relative fair values of these assets 
factors considered by management in performing these analyses include an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease up periods considering current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases 
in estimating carrying costs  management includes real estate taxes  insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rental revenue during the expected lease up periods based on current market demand 
management also estimates costs to execute similar leases including leasing commissions 
in allocating the fair value of the identified intangible assets and liabilities of an acquired property  above market and below market in place lease values are recorded based on the difference between the current in place lease rent and a management estimate of current market rents 
the aggregate value of other acquired intangible assets  consisting of in place leases and tenant relationships  is measured by the excess of i the purchase price paid for a property over ii the estimated fair value of the property as if vacant  determined as set forth above 
this aggregate value is allocated between in place lease values and tenant relationships based on management s evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant s lease 
the value of in place leases and customer relationships are amortized to expense over the remaining non cancelable periods of the respective leases 
impairment of real estate 
the company evaluates the carrying value of all real estate held to determine if an impairment has occurred which would require the recognition of a loss 
the evaluation includes reviewing anticipated cash flows of the property  based on current leases in place  coupled with an estimate of proceeds to be realized upon sale 
however  estimating future sale proceeds is highly subjective and such estimates could differ materially from actual results 
liquidity and capital resources since becoming a public company  the company s principal sources of capital for growth has been the public and private equity markets  selective secured indebtedness  its unsecured credit facility  issuance of op units and undistributed funds from operations 
the company expects to continue to have access to and use these sources in the future  however  there are factors that may have a material adverse effect on the company s access to capital sources 
the company s ability to incur additional debt to fund acquisitions is dependent upon its existing leverage  the value of the assets the company is attempting to leverage and general economic conditions which may be outside of management s influence 
the company s current million variable rate unsecured revolving credit facility  which is scheduled to expire in august  has made available funds to finance acquisitions and meet any short term working capital requirements 
as of december   million was outstanding at an interest rate of 
subsequent to year end  the company repaid million of its outstanding line balance 
the company pays an unused facility fee equal to basis points if or less of the facility is utilized and basis points if greater than of the facility is utilized 
the company has the option to extend the maturity to august  if no defaults exist  for a payment of million

in addition  the company has purchased million in real estate through the direct issuance of its common shares and op units 
during  the company completed a million common share offering at per share and a million common share offering at per share raising an aggregate of million of net proceeds 
the company completed a million preferred share offering at per share with a coupon raising net proceeds of million 
the proceeds of these offerings were used to repay debt and fund acquisitions 
dividends 
in connection with its intention to continue to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes  the company expects to continue paying regular dividends to its shareholders 
these dividends are expected to be paid from operating cash flows and or from other sources 
since cash used to pay dividends reduces amounts available for capital investments  the company generally intends to maintain a conservative dividend payout ratio as a percentage of ffo  reserving such amounts as it considers necessary for the maintenance or expansion of properties in its portfolio  debt reduction  the acquisition of interests in new properties as suitable opportunities arise  and such other factors as the board of trustees considers appropriate 
dividends paid to common shareholders increased to million in  compared to million in and million in although the company receives the majority of its rental payments on a monthly basis  it intends to continue paying dividends quarterly 
the company s second largest tenant  as a percentage of revenue  pays its rent quarterly northwest pipeline corp amounts accumulated in advance of each quarterly distribution are invested by the company in short term money market or other suitable instruments 
the company believes that cash flows from operations will continue to provide adequate capital to fund its operating and administrative expenses  regular debt service obligations and all dividend payments in accordance with reit requirements in both the short term and long term 
in addition  the company anticipates that cash on hand  borrowings under its unsecured credit facility  issuance of equity and debt  as well as other alternatives  will provide the necessary capital required by the company 
cash flows from operations as reported in the consolidated statements of cash flows increased to million for from million for and million for cash flows from operations was negatively impacted in  and by the payment of million  million and million  respectively in prepayment penalties on debt satisfactions 
net cash used in investing activities totaled million in  million in and million in cash used in investing activities related primarily to investments in real estate properties and joint ventures

upreit structure 
the company s upreit structure permits the company to effect acquisitions by issuing to a property owner  as a form of consideration in exchange for the property  op units in partnerships controlled by the company 
all of such op units are redeemable at certain times for common shares on a one for one basis and all of such op units require the company to pay certain distributions to the holders of such op units 
the company accounts for these op units in a manner similar to a minority interest holder 
the number of common shares that will be outstanding in the future should be expected to increase  and minority interest expense should be expected to decrease  as such op units are redeemed for common shares 
the following table provides certain information with respect to such op units as of december  assuming the company s annualized dividend rate remains at the current per share 
current total annualized current total per op annualized redeemable for number affiliate unit distribution common shares of op units op units distribution at any time    at any time    at any time   march  march  november   march  march  january  january   february   may  november   affiliate op units  which are included in total op units  represent op units held by two executive officers including their affiliates of the company

the ability of the company to accomplish such goals will be affected by numerous economic factors affecting the real estate industry  including the availability and cost of mortgage debt at the time  the company s equity in the mortgaged properties  the financial condition of the company  the operating history of the mortgaged properties  the then current tax laws and the general national  regional and local economic conditions 
the company expects to continue to use property specific  non recourse mortgages as it believes that by properly matching a debt obligation  including the balloon maturity risk  with a lease expiration the company s cash on cash returns increase and the exposure to residual valuation risk is reduced 
lease obligations 
since the company s tenants bear all or substantially all of the cost of property operations  maintenance and repairs  the company does not anticipate significant needs for cash for these costs 
for eight of the properties  the company has a level of property operating expense responsibility and a ninth obligated the company to pay real estate taxes in and for the tenant to be responsible thereafter 
the company generally funds property expansions with additional secured borrowings  the repayment of which is funded out of rental increases under the leases covering the expanded properties 
to the extent there is a vacancy in a property  the company would be obligated for all operating expenses  including real estate taxes and insurance 
the company s tenants pay the rental obligations on ground leases either directly to the fee holder or to the company as increased rent

due to the net lease structure the company does not incur significant expenditures in the ordinary course of business to maintain its properties 
however  in the future  as leases expire the company expects to incur costs in extending the existing tenant lease or re tenanting the properties 
the amounts of these expenditures can vary significantly depending on tenant negotiations  market conditions and rental rates 
these expenditures are expected to be funded from operating cash flows or borrowings on the credit facility 
shares repurchase 
the company s board of trustees has authorized the company to repurchase  from time to time  up to million common shares and op units depending on market conditions and other factors 
as of december   the company had repurchased approximately million common shares and op units  at an average price of approximately per common share op unit

this revenue source was partly offset by an increase in i interest expense of million in due to increased acquisition leverage and ii depreciation expense of million in due to more depreciable assets owned 
the financial information for non consolidated entities does not include information for lra 
any increase in net income in future periods will be closely tied to the level of acquisitions made by the company 
without acquisitions  which in addition to generating rental revenue  generate acquisition  debt placement and asset management fees when such properties are acquired by joint venture or advisory programs  growth in net income is dependent on index adjusted rents leases  percentage rents leases  reduced interest expense on amortizing mortgages and by controlling variable overhead costs 
however  there are many factors beyond management s control that could offset these items including  without limitation  increased interest rates of variable debt million as of december  at a weighted average interest rate of and tenant monetary defaults

inflation 
the company s long term leases contain provisions to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation on its operating results 
such provisions include clauses entitling the company to receive i scheduled fixed base rent increases and ii base rent increases based upon the consumer price index 
in addition  the majority of the company s leases require tenants to pay operating expenses  including maintenance  real estate taxes  insurance and utilities  thereby reducing the company s exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
environmental matters 
based upon management s ongoing review of its properties  management is not aware of any environmental condition with respect to any of the company s properties  which would be reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the company 
there can be no assurance  however  that i the discovery of environmental conditions  which were previously unknown  ii changes in law  iii the conduct of tenants or iv activities relating to properties in the vicinity of the company s properties  will not expose the company to material liability in the future 
changes in laws increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on properties or increasing the restrictions on discharges or other conditions may result in significant unanticipated expenditures or may otherwise adversely affect the operations of the company s tenants  which would adversely affect the company s financial condition and results of operations 
funds from operations the company believes that funds from operations ffo enhances an investor s understanding of the company s financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the company believes that ffo is an appropriate  but limited  measure of the performance of an equity reit 
ffo is defined in the april white paper  issued by the national association of real estate investment trusts  inc nareit as net income or loss  computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of property  plus real estate depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
the company included in the calculation of ffo the dilutive effect of the deemed conversion of its outstanding exchangeable notes  which were fully satisfied in ffo should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indicator of operating performance or to cash flows from operating activities as determined in accordance with gaap  or as a measure of liquidity to other consolidated income or cash flow statement data as determined in accordance with gaap
