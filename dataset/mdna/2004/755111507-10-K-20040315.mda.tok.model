the company is a leader in defense electronics  including missiles  radar  sensors and electro optics  intelligence  surveillance  and reconnaissance isr  command  control  communication  and information systems  naval systems  air traffic control systems  and technical services 
the company s defense businesses are well positioned to capitalize on emerging opportunities in missile defense  precision engagement  intelligence  surveillance  and reconnaissance  and homeland security 
due to the multi year defense spending cycle  recent increased budget authorizations in these areas are expected to favorably impact the company s defense businesses over the next several years 
raytheon aircraft is a leading provider of business and special mission aircraft and delivers a broad line of jet  turboprop  and piston powered airplanes to individual  corporate  and government customers worldwide 
defense industry considerations recent events  including the global war on terrorism  operation enduring freedom  and operation iraqi freedom  have altered the defense and security environment of the united states 
these events have had  and for the foreseeable future are likely to continue to have  a significant impact on the markets for defense and advanced technology systems and products 
the us department of defense continues to focus on both supporting ongoing operations and transforming our military to confront future threats 
our customers plan to operate in a new paradigm 
they define an approach that emphasizes speed  precision  and flexibility  by sharing superior knowledge  enabling forces to seize and sustain initiative  concentrate combat power  and prevent an enemy response 
in this new environment  the need for advanced technology and defense electronics is clear 
the recent growth in military expenditures is driven by the multi pronged approach required to fight the war on terrorism  replenish war materials consumed during continued operations in afghanistan and iraq  and sustain the momentum in pursuit of transformation 
the company s strategy is designed to capitalize on the breadth and depth of the company s technology and extensive domain expertise in order to meet the evolving needs of the company s customers 
the company is focusing on the following strategic business areas  which are aligned with the ongoing military operations and department of defense transformation goals missile defense precision engagement intelligence  surveillance and reconnaissance homeland security missile defense the company provides an extensive array of technologies and is a major partner in missile defense 
the company is committed to helping the us missile defense agency  the organization responsible for developing an operational ballistic missile defense system achieve its objectives 
the president s commitment to have a us missile defense system operational by is reinforced by the increase in emphasis and funding in the latest budgets 
the company s broad array of technologies covers all three phases of the missile defense system boost  midcourse  and terminal defense and includes standard missile  space tracking and surveillance system  cobra judy  exo atmospheric kill vehicle  early warning radar  sea based x band radar  high power discriminator  terminal high altitude area defense  and patriot 
precision engagement the company provides mission solutions across the entire precision engagement chain 
the company s customers are increasingly looking for mission solutions that address the need to operate jointly across services and between allied forces  work in a new net centric paradigm  minimize collateral damage  and strike time sensitive targets 
the company s precision engagement systems include u sensor suite  f and f a active electronically scanned array radars  advanced medium range air to air missile  situation awareness data link  netfires  joint standoff weapon  paveway  tactical tomahawk  f a radar warning receiver  high power microwave  and high energy lasers

these abilities are crucial for war fighters to achieve information dominance throughout the entire battlespace 
the company s key isr programs include global hawk sensor suite  e a battle management command and control  space based radar  national polar orbiting operational environmental satellite systems  future combat systems  dd x  and numerous classified programs 
homeland security in the area of homeland security  the company has skills  experience  and technology in areas such as airport security  command  control  and communication  and the integration and fusion of sensory inputs for real time decision support 
this is still a new market with significant uncertainty and the ultimate customers and available funding have yet to be determined 

table of contents unlike many major defense contractors  the company provides electronics for a wide range of missions and platforms 
the company has several thousand programs which the company believes reduces some of the risk and volatility often inherent in the defense industry 
the company generally acts as a prime contractor or subcontractor on its programs 
the funding of us government programs is subject to congressional authorization and appropriation 
while congress generally appropriates funds on a fiscal year basis  major defense programs are usually conducted under binding contracts over multiple years 
the termination of funding for a us government program could result in a loss of future revenues  which would have a negative effect on the company s financial position and results of operations 
us government contracts are also subject to oversight audits and contain provisions for termination 
failure to comply with us government regulations could lead to suspension or debarment from us government contracting 
sales to the us government may be affected by changes in procurement policies  budget considerations  changing defense requirements  and political developments 
the influence of these factors  which are largely beyond the company s control  could impact the company s financial position or results of operations 
aircraft industry considerations the health of the markets for raytheon aircraft s products and services is influenced by a number of key economic and environmental factors including economic growth or sustained market stability the industry wide level of inventory of used aircraft available for sale regulatory and environmental factors including continued open access to national airspace and airports and operational equipment requirements introduction of new products while the economy has shown signs of recovery by most measures including gdp  corporate profits  and personal disposable income  the general aviation market continues to be depressed from its peak performance in historically  the industry has lagged the us economic recovery by months 
traditionally  the used aircraft market has led the recovery of the new aircraft market by approximately nine months  however  the current size of the worldwide fleet of used aircraft available for sale and a slower economic recovery could delay market demand for new aircraft 
the size of the worldwide fleet of used aircraft available for sale has created intense price pressure on new aircraft and  as a result  many manufacturers have reduced line or production rates to avoid oversupplying the market with products that will only be moved through deep discounting 
to support a recovery of the new aircraft market  the current worldwide inventory of used aircraft must be reduced 
despite the increased activity in the used aircraft market during the last half of and strong fourth quarter sales activity for new aircraft  driven in large part by the bonus depreciation benefit of the jobs growth tax relief reconciliation act of  the industry consensus is that the market for new aircraft will remain flat to slightly higher through with a modest recovery beginning in financial summary as discussed in more detail throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations gross bookings were billion in  billion in  and billion in resulting in backlog of billion  billion  and billion at december    and  respectively 
backlog represents future sales and cash flow that will be recognized over the next several years 
net sales were billion in  billion in  and billion in the increase in sales was a result of strong growth at the defense businesses  primarily integrated defense systems  missile systems  and space and airborne systems 
operating income was billion in  billion in  and billion in operating income as a percent of net sales was percent  percent  and percent in   and  respectively 
included in operating income was a fas cas pension adjustment  described below in consolidated results of operations  of million of expense in  million of income in  and million of income in the fas cas pension adjustment in is expected to be approximately million of expense 
also included in operating income were charges at network centric systems and technical services of million  charges at raytheon airline aviation services of million  and goodwill amortization of million 
operating cash flow from continuing operations was billion in  billion in  and billion in the increase from was due to better working capital management at the defense businesses and better inventory management at raytheon aircraft 
although the company will continue to focus on working capital management at the defense businesses  this level of improvement is not expected to continue into the foreseeable future 
critical accounting policies the company has identified the following accounting policies that require significant judgment 
the company believes its judgments related to these accounting policies are appropriate 
sales under long term government contracts are recorded under the percentage of completion method 
incurred costs and estimated gross margins are recorded as sales as work is performed based on the percentage that incurred costs bear to estimated total costs using the company s estimates of costs and contract value 
cost estimates include direct and indirect costs 
table of contents such as labor  materials  warranty  and overhead 
some contracts contain incentive provisions based upon performance in relation to established targets which are included at estimated realizable value 
contract change orders and claims are included when they can be reliably estimated and realization is probable 
due to the long term nature of many of the company s programs  developing estimates of costs and contract value often requires significant judgment 
factors that must be considered in estimating the work to be completed and ultimate contract recovery include labor productivity and availability  the nature and complexity of the work to be performed  the impact of change orders  availability of materials  the impact of delayed performance  availability and timing of funding from the customer  award fee estimations  and the recoverability of claims 
in   and  operating income as a percent of net sales for the defense businesses did not vary by more than percent 
if operating income as a percent of net sales for the defense businesses had been higher or lower by percent in  the company s operating income would have changed by approximately million 
the company uses lot accounting for new commercial aircraft introductions at raytheon aircraft 
lot accounting involves selecting an initial lot size at the time a new aircraft begins to be delivered and measuring an average cost over the entire lot for each aircraft sold 
the costs attributed to aircraft delivered are based on the estimated average cost of all aircraft in the lot and are determined under the learning curve concept which anticipates a predictable decrease in unit costs from cost reduction initiatives and as tasks and production techniques become more efficient through repetition 
once production costs stabilize  which is expected by the time the initial lot has been completed  the use of lot accounting is discontinued 
the selection of lot size is a critical judgment 
the company determines lot size based on several factors  including the size of firm backlog  the expected annual production for the aircraft  and experience on similar new aircraft 
the size of the initial lot for the beechcraft premier i  the only aircraft the company is currently utilizing lot accounting for  is units 
in  the company recorded a pretax charge of million to reflect the expected loss on the initial lot 
a five percent increase in the remaining estimated cost to produce the aircraft would reduce the company s operating income by approximately million 
the valuation of used aircraft in inventories  which are stated at cost  but not in excess of realizable value  requires significant judgment 
as part of the assessment of realizable value  the company must evaluate many factors including current market conditions  future market conditions  the age and condition of the aircraft  and availability levels for the aircraft in the market 
a five percent decrease in the aggregate realizable value of used aircraft in inventory at december   would result in an impairment charge of approximately million 
the valuation of aircraft materials and parts which support the worldwide fleet of aircraft  which are stated at cost  but not in excess of realizable value  also requires significant judgment 
as part of the assessment of realizable value  the company must evaluate many factors including the expected useful life of the aircraft  some of which have remained in service for up to years 
a five percent decrease in the aggregate realizable value of aircraft materials and purchased parts at december   would result in an impairment charge of approximately million 
the company evaluates the recoverability of long lived assets upon indication of possible impairment by measuring the carrying amount of the assets against the related estimated undiscounted cash flows 
when an evaluation indicates that the future undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of the assets  the asset is adjusted to its estimated fair value 
the determination of what constitutes an indication of possible impairment  the estimation of future cash flows  and the determination of estimated fair value are all significant judgments 
in addition  the company performs an annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of each year 
the company estimates the fair value of reporting units using a discounted cash flow model based on the company s most recent five year plan and compares the estimated fair value to the net book value of the reporting unit  including goodwill 
preparation of forecasts for use in the five year plan involve significant judgments 
changes in these forecasts could affect the estimated fair value of certain of the company s reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period 
the company has pension plans covering the majority of its employees  including certain employees in foreign countries 
the selection of the assumptions used to determine pension expense or income involves significant judgment 
the company s long term return on asset roa and discount rate assumptions are considered to be the key variables in determining pension expense or income 
to develop the long term roa assumption  the company considered the current level of expected returns on risk free investments  the historical level of the risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which the company has invested pension plan assets  and the expectations for future returns of each asset class 
since the company s investment policy is to employ active management strategies in all asset classes  the potential exists to outperform the broader markets  therefore  the expected returns were adjusted upward 
the expected return for each asset class was then weighted based on the target asset allocation to develop the long term roa assumption 
the long term roa assumption is based on target asset allocations of between and percent equities with a expected return  between and percent fixed income with a expected return  up to percent real estate with an expected return  and between and percent other including private equity and cash with a expected return 
the long term roa assumption for the company s domestic pension plans in is 
the discount rate assumption was determined by using a model consisting of a theoretical bond portfolio that matches the company s 
table of contents pension liability duration 
the discount rate assumption for the company s domestic pension plans in is 
the company s pension expense is expected to be approximately million in and million in for every percent that in the actual domestic pension plan asset return exceeds or is less than the long term roa assumption for  the company s pension expense for will change by approximately million 
if the company adjusts the discount rate assumption for up or down by basis points  the company s pension expense would change by approximately million 
effective january   the company changed the measurement date for its pension and other postretirement benefit plans from october to december this change in measurement date will be accounted for as a change in accounting principle 
the cumulative effect of this change in accounting principle is anticipated to be a gain of million after tax for pension benefits and a gain of million after tax for other postretirement benefits and will be recognized in using the company s year end as the measurement date for pension and other postretirement benefit plans more appropriately reflects the plans financial status for the years then ended 
consolidated results of operations net sales were billion in  billion in  and billion in the increase in sales was due primarily to higher us department of defense expenditures in the company s defense businesses  primarily integrated defense systems  missile systems  and space and airborne systems 
sales to the us department of defense were percent of sales in  percent in  and percent in total sales to the us government  including foreign military sales  were percent of sales in  percent in  and percent in international sales  including foreign military sales  were percent of sales in  percent in  and percent in while international sales have remained flat  the amount as a percent of sales has declined as a result of increased sales to the us department of defense 
gross margin net sales less cost of sales was billion in  billion in  and billion in  or percent of sales in  percent in  and percent in included in gross margin was a fas cas pension adjustment  described below  of million of expense  million of income  and million of income in   and  respectively 
the change in the fas cas pension adjustment was due primarily to the reduction in the company s long term return on asset assumption and the actual rate of return on pension plan assets over the last several years 
the decrease in gross margin as a percent of sales in was due  in part  to charges of million at network centric systems and million at technical services  described below in segment results
