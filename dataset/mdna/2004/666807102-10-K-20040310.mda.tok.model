item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview northrop grumman provides technologically advanced  innovative products  services  and solutions in defense and commercial electronics  nuclear and non nuclear shipbuilding  information technology  mission systems  systems integration  and space technology 
as a prime contractor  principal subcontractor  partner  or preferred supplier  northrop grumman participates in many high priority defense and commercial technology programs in the united states and abroad 
northrop grumman conducts most of its business with the us government  principally the department of defense dod 
the company also conducts business with foreign governments and makes domestic and international commercial sales 
results the financial statements include trw inc trw  which was acquired on december  this acquisition had a significant effect on the company s operations and is an important factor to be considered in comparing results with results 
selected financial highlights are presented in the table below

earnings per share are based on weighted average diluted shares outstanding of million for and million for the significant increase in shares outstanding is primarily the result of the acquisition of trw in exchange for stock 
cash provided by operating activities was million lower in compared with in  cash provided by operating activities was reduced by approximately billion for taxes paid related to the completion of the b engineering and manufacturing development emd contract 

table of contents northrop grumman corporation in february  the company sold the automotive business auto  a component of trw  for billion in cash  a payment in kind note  and an interest in the new enterprise 
the cash received was used primarily to reduce debt 
in  the company also implemented a share repurchase program of up to million of its outstanding common stock  purchasing over million shares for approximately million as of december  outlook through sixteen acquisitions over the past decade the company has evolved from an aircraft manufacturer into a global enterprise focused on providing a broad range of products and services needed to meet the nation s defense and homeland security challenges 
the company believes that its portfolio of technologically advanced  innovative products  services  and solutions in systems integration  defense electronics  information technology  advanced aircraft  shipbuilding  and space technology will generate revenue growth in and beyond 
in  based on its current total backlog funded and unfunded of billion and its opportunity to win future programs  the company expects revenue of approximately billion and improvements in net income and cash provided by operations over the major industry and economic factors that will affect the company s future performance are described in the following paragraphs 
industry factors while northrop grumman is subject to the usual vagaries of the marketplace  it is also affected by the unique characteristics of the defense industry and by certain elements peculiar to its own business mix 
lockheed martin corporation  the boeing company  raytheon company  and general dynamics corporation are among the largest companies in the defense industry at this time 
northrop grumman competes against these and other companies for a number of programs  both large and small 
intense competition and long operating cycles are both key characteristics of northrop grumman s business and the defense industry 
it is common in this industry for work on major programs to be shared among a number of companies 
a company competing to be a prime contractor may  upon ultimate award of the contract  turn out to be a subcontractor 
it is not uncommon to compete with a peer company and  simultaneously on other contracts  to be either a supplier to or a customer of such competitor 
the nature of major defense programs  conducted under binding contracts  allows companies that perform well to benefit from a level of program continuity unknown in many industries 
an individual company s success in the competitive defense industry depends upon its ability to develop and market its products  as well as its ability to provide the people  facilities  equipment  and financial capacity needed to deliver those products with maximum efficiency 
it is necessary to maintain  as the company has  sources for raw materials  fabricated parts  electronic components  and major subassemblies 
in this manufacturing and systems integration environment  effective oversight of subcontractors and suppliers is as vital to success as managing internal operations 
northrop grumman s operating policies are designed to achieve these objectives 
economic opportunities  challenges  and risks the defense of the united states and other north atlantic treaty organization nato countries requires the ability to respond to one or more regional conflicts  terrorist acts  homeland security  and proactive threat identification 
such engagements may require unilateral or cooperative initiatives ranging from passive surveillance to active engagement  deterrence  policing  or peacekeeping 
in addition  the dod s strategy continues to be affected by the general public s concern for placing military or civilian personnel at risk 
as a result of these trends  both the united states and other nato countries are increasingly relying on sophisticated weapon systems that provide long range surveillance and intelligence  battle management  and precision strike capabilities combined with the ability to rapidly deploy complete defensive platforms around the world 
accordingly  defense procurement spending is expected to be weighted towards the development and procurement of advanced electronics and software that enhance the capabilities of individual weapons systems and provide for the real time integration of individual surveillance  information management  strike  and battle management platforms 

table of contents northrop grumman corporation united states defense contractors have benefited from the upward trend in overall defense spending over recent years 
defense spending in nato countries has stabilized  while those countries continue to increase their focus upon the development and procurement of advanced electronics and information systems capabilities 
although the ultimate size of future defense budgets remains uncertain  current indications are that the defense budget will increase over the next five years 
looking forward  based on the budget submitted by the president of the united states  the company continues to plan for steady  sustainable growth in national security spending 
the future year defense program fydp shows an increase to the dod investment accounts of about percent for  with double digit increases in areas like missile defense 
the remainder of the fydp shows approximately percent annual growth through the company believes that spending on recapitalization and transformation of our homeland security and defense assets will continue to be a national priority  with particular emphasis on areas like national missile defense 
substantial new competitive opportunities for the company include space based radar  aerial common sensor  transformational communication system  the joint unmanned combat air system j ucas  and several international and homeland security programs 
the company continues to focus on operational and financial performance for continued growth in and beyond 
us government programs in which northrop grumman either participates  or strives to participate  must compete with other programs for consideration during our nation s budget formulation and appropriation processes 
budget decisions made in this environment will have long term consequences for the size and structure of northrop grumman and the entire defense industry 
northrop grumman has historically concentrated its efforts in high technology areas such as stealth  airborne surveillance  battle management  precision weapons  systems integration  defense electronics  and information technology 
through its acquisitions of litton industries  inc litton  newport news shipbuilding inc newport news  and trw  the company now has a significant presence in space technology  command  control intelligence ci  federal and civil information systems  missile systems  and the manufacture of a broad range of ships including aircraft carriers and submarines 
the company believes that its programs are a high priority for national defense  but there remains the possibility that one or more of them may be reduced  extended  or terminated 
the company provides certain product warranties that require repair or replacement of non conforming items for a specified period of time 
most of the company s product warranties are provided under government contracts  the costs of which are generally recoverable from the customer 
prime contracts with various agencies of the us government and subcontracts with other prime contractors are subject to numerous procurement regulations  including the false claims act  and the international traffic in arms regulation promulgated under the arms export control act with noncompliance found by any one agency possibly resulting in fines  penalties  debarment  or suspension from receiving additional contracts with all us government agencies 
given the company s dependence on us government business  suspension or debarment could have a material adverse effect on the company s future

the contract  which is currently in the emd and transition to production phases  is expected to be completed in development work inherently has more uncertainty as to future events than production work and therefore more variability in estimates of costs to complete the work 
as work progresses through the development stage into production  the risks associated with estimating the costs of development are reduced 
in addition  successful performance of fixed price development programs is subject to the company s ability to control cost growth in meeting production specifications and delivery rates 
while management has used its best judgment to estimate costs  future events could result in either upward or downward adjustments to those estimates

critical accounting policies  estimates  and judgments the company s established policies are outlined in note to the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii  item of this form k 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses as well as the 
table of contents northrop grumman corporation disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
as part of its oversight responsibilities  management evaluates the propriety of its estimates  judgments  and accounting methods as new events occur 
management believes that its policies  judgments  and assessments have been consistently applied in a manner that provides the reader of the company s financial statements a current  accurate  and complete presentation of information in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
management periodically reviews the company s critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of its board of directors 
principal accounting practices that involve a higher degree of judgment or complexity are outlined below revenue recognition as a defense contractor engaging in long term contracts  the company extensively utilizes the cost to cost and the units of delivery measures of the percentage of completion method of accounting 
application of this accounting method requires the use of estimates of costs to be incurred for the design  manufacture  and delivery of aircraft carriers  submarines  aircraft and subassemblies  radars  intricate components and systems for space communications  as well as the engineering  development  and integration of software systems and other highly technical products 
such costs are typically incurred over a period of several years  and estimation of these costs requires the use of judgment 
the cost estimation process is based upon the professional knowledge and experience of the company s engineers  program managers  and financial professionals 
factors that are considered in estimating the work to be completed and ultimate contract recovery include the availability and productivity of labor  the nature and complexity of the work to be performed  the effect of change orders  the availability of materials  the effect of any delays in performance  availability and timing of funding from the customer  and the recoverability of any claims included in the estimates to complete 
a significant change in an estimate on one or more programs could have a material effect on the company s results of operations 
contract cost estimates are updated at least annually and more frequently in certain circumstances 
cost and revenue estimates for each significant contract are reviewed and reassessed quarterly 
sales under cost reimbursement contracts are recorded as costs are incurred 
certain contracts contain profit incentives based upon performance relative to predetermined targets that may occur during or subsequent to delivery of the product 
incentives that can be reasonably estimated are recorded over the performance period of the contract 
incentives that cannot be reasonably estimated are recorded when awarded 
certain contracts contain provisions for the redetermination of price based upon future economic conditions 
contract change orders and claims are included in sales when they can be reasonably estimated and realization is probable 
purchase accounting and goodwill the purchase price of an acquired business is allocated to the underlying tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair market values  with the excess recorded as goodwill 
such fair market value assessments require judgments and estimates that can be affected by contract performance and other factors over time that may cause final amounts to differ from original estimates 
the company evaluates the recovery of recorded goodwill amounts annually  or when evidence of potential impairment exists 
in order to test for potential impairment  the company uses a discounted cash flow analysis  corroborated by comparative market multiples  where appropriate 
the principal factors used in the discounted cash flow analysis requiring judgment are the weighted average cost of capital and the terminal value growth rate assumptions 
differences in these assumptions  within a range considered by management to be reasonable  applied to the annual impairment test  would not have had a significant impact to the consolidated financial statements 
the company has established certain accruals in connection with indemnities and other contingencies arising from its acquisitions and divestitures 
these accruals and subsequent adjustments have been recorded during the 
table of contents northrop grumman corporation purchase price allocation period 
the accruals were determined based upon the terms of the purchase agreements and  in most cases  involve a significant degree of judgment 
management has recorded these accruals in accordance with its interpretation of the terms of the purchase agreements  known facts  and an estimation of probable future events based on management s experience and consultation with outside experts 
changes in facts and interpretation or anticipated future events may have a significant impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
litigation  commitments  and contingencies the company is subject to a range of claims  lawsuits  environmental and income tax matters  and administrative proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business 
estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires judgment and assessment based upon professional knowledge and experience of management and its legal counsel 
in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for contingencies  amounts are recorded as charges to earnings when management  after taking into consideration the facts and circumstances of each matter  including any settlement offers  has determined that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
the ultimate resolution of any such exposure to the company may vary from earlier estimates as further facts and circumstances become known 
the company is subject to the environmental laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which it conducts operations 
the company records an accrual to provide for the costs of expected environmental obligations when management becomes aware that an expenditure will be required 
factors which could result in changes to the company s environmental accruals and reasonably possible range of loss include modification of planned remedial actions  increase or decrease in the estimated time required to remediate  discovery of more extensive contamination than anticipated  changes in laws and regulations affecting remediation requirements  and improvements in remediation technology 
the company believes it complies with environmental laws applicable to its operations 
the company does not believe that continued compliance with these environmental laws will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations 
however  a significant change in laws  the discovery of previously unknown contamination  and other factors could result in expenditures that are materially greater than currently estimated 
retirement benefits assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair values of plan assets for the company s pension plans and other post retirement benefits plans are regularly evaluated by management in consultation with outside actuaries who are relied upon as experts 
in the event that the company determines that changes in the assumptions are warranted  future pension and post retirement benefit expenses could increase or decrease 
the principal assumptions that have a significant impact on the financial condition and operating results of the company are the discount rate  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  and the health care cost trend rates 
the discount rate represents the interest rate that should be used to determine the present value of future cash flows currently expected to be required to settle the pension and post retirement benefit obligations 
the discount rate is generally based on the yield on high quality corporate fixed income investments 
at the end of each year  the appropriate discount rate is determined based on consultation with outside actuaries  consideration of survey results  the moody s aa corporate bond rate  and the results of a hypothetical long term bond portfolio matching the expected cash inflows with the expected benefit payments 
taking into consideration the factors noted above  the company lowered the discount rate to percent at december   from percent at december  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets represents the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested to provide for anticipated benefit payments 
for  the company assumed an expected long term rate 
table of contents northrop grumman corporation of return on plan assets of percent 
on average  the actual return on plan assets over the long term has exceeded percent  however  for  the expected long term rate of return assumption was lowered from percent to percent  reflecting the generally expected moderation of long term rates of return in the financial markets 
the health care cost trend rates represent the annual rate of change in the cost of health care benefits based on estimates of health care inflation  changes in health care utilization or delivery patterns  technological advances  and changes in the health status of the plan participants 
differences in the discount rate  expected long term rate of return on plan assets  and the health care cost trend rates within reasonably likely ranges would have had the following impact on results in millions 
percentage point increase 
percentage point decrease increase decrease to pension expense resulting from change in discount rate change in long term rate of return on plan assets in millions percentage point increase percentage point decrease increase decrease from change in health care cost trend rates to postretirement benefit expense postretirement benefit liability other matters new accounting pronouncements several new accounting pronouncements were issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb  which became effective during the periods presented

table of contents northrop grumman corporation forward looking statements and important factors certain statements and assumptions throughout this report contain or are based on forward looking information that northrop grumman believes to be within the definition in the private securities litigation reform act of and involve risks and uncertainties  and include  among others  statements in the future tense  and all statements accompanied by terms such as believe  project  expect  estimate  assume  intend  anticipate  and variations thereof and similar terms 
this information reflects the company s best estimates when made  but the company expressly disclaims any duty to update this information if new data becomes available or estimates change after the date of this report 
these forward looking statements should  therefore  be considered in light of various important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from estimates or projections including  without limitation the company depends on a limited number of customers 
the company is heavily dependent on government contracts  many of which are only partially funded 
the termination or failure to fund one or more significant contracts could have a negative impact on operations 
the company is a supplier  either directly or as a subcontractor or team member  to the us government and its agencies as well as foreign governments and agencies 
these contracts are subject to each customer s political and budgetary constraints  changes in short range and long range plans  the timing of contract awards  the congressional budget authorization and appropriation processes  the government s ability to terminate contracts for convenience or for default  as well as other risks such as contractor suspension or debarment in the event of certain violations of legal and regulatory requirements 
many of the company s contracts are fixed price contracts 
while firm  fixed price contracts allow the company to benefit from cost savings  they also expose the company to the risk of cost overruns 
if the company s initial estimates used for calculating contract prices are incorrect  the company can incur losses on those contracts 
in addition  some of the company s contracts have provisions relating to cost controls and audit rights  and if the company fails to meet the terms specified in those contracts  then the company may not realize their full benefits 
the company s ability to manage costs on these contracts may affect its financial condition 
lower earnings caused by cost overruns would have an adverse effect on the company s financial results 
in addition  in those instances where the company has entered into contracts for fixed price development programs  the company s successful performance of such programs is subject to its ability to control cost growth in meeting production specifications and delivery rates 
the company is subject to significant competition 
the company s markets include defense and commercial areas where it competes with companies of substantial size and resources 
the company s success or failure in winning new contracts or follow on orders for its existing or future products may cause material fluctuations in the company s future revenues and operating results 
the company s operations may be subject to events that cause adverse effects on its ability to meet contract obligations within anticipated cost and time constraints 
the company may encounter internal problems and delays in delivery as a result of issues with respect to design  technology  licensing and patent rights  labor  or materials and components that prevent the company from achieving contract requirements 
the company may be affected by delivery or performance issues with key suppliers and subcontractors  as well as other factors inherent in the company s businesses that may cause operating results to be adversely affected 
operating results are also dependent on successful negotiation of collective bargaining agreements 
changes in inventory requirements or other production cost increases may also have a negative impact on the company s operating results 
if the company does not perform its plans as intended  or if the company encounters unforeseen problems  or problems subsequently develop  the company s operating results may be adversely affected 
among the factors that may be involved would be unforeseen costs and expenses  and diversion of management focus in responding to unforeseen liabilities

the company assumes that any divestiture of non core businesses and assets will be completed successfully 
the company s performance may be affected by its inability to successfully dispose of assets and businesses that do not fit with  or are no longer appropriate to  the company s strategic plan 
if any sales of such businesses or assets can be made only at a loss  the company s earnings will be reduced 
the company is subject to environmental litigation and other litigation  which  if not resolved within the company s expectation  could reduce future operating results 
the company s pension expense income may fluctuate significantly 
pension expense income is based on assumptions of future market performance  and actual performance may differ 
if an event requires the company to reestimate its pension expense income during the year  its reported earnings could vary significantly 
the company s tax filings are regularly examined by federal and state taxing authorities 
results of these examinations can result in tax deficiencies  cumulative interest payments  fines  and penalties 
such assessments could negatively affect the company s results of operations  financial condition  and or cash flow
