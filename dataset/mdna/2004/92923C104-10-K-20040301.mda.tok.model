item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates on an on going basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition traditional homebuilding 
we recognize homebuilding revenues when homes close and title to and possession of the property is formally transferred to the buyer 
the majority of our homebuilding revenues are received in cash within one or two days subsequent to closing 
we include amounts in transit from title companies at the end of each reporting period in cash and cash equivalents 
we either retain or refund to the home buyer deposits on canceled sales contracts  depending upon the provisions of the contracts 
revenue recognition tower homebuilding 
revenue for tower residences under construction is recognized on the percentage of completion method 
revenue is recorded as a portion of the value of non cancelable tower unit contracts when construction is beyond a preliminary stage  the buyer is committed to the extent of being unable to require a full refund except for non delivery of the residence  a substantial percentage of residences are under firm contracts  sales prices are collectible and costs can be reasonably estimated 
revenue recognized is calculated based upon the percentage of total costs incurred in relation to estimated total costs 
the percentage of completion method is applied since we meet applicable requirements under sfas  accounting for sales of real estate 
actual revenues and costs to complete building construction in the future could differ from our current estimates 
if our estimates of tower revenues and development costs are significantly different from actual amounts  then our revenues  related cumulative profits and costs of sales may be revised in the period that estimates change 
contracts receivable 
amounts due under tower sales contracts  to the extent recognized as revenue under the percentage of completion method  are recorded as contracts receivable 
we review the collectibility of contracts receivable on a quarterly basis and provide for estimated losses due to potential customer defaults 
historically  approximately to of the contracts for which refundable contract deposits were collected by us defaulted on the obligation to close the purchase of the tower unit 
actual contract defaults may differ from our current estimates 
real estate inventories and cost of sales 
in accordance with sfas  accounting for costs and initial rental operations for real estate projects  real estate inventories including land  common development costs and estimates for costs to complete  are allocated to each parcel or lot based on the estimated relative sales value of each parcel or lot  as compared to the sales value of the total project  while site specific development costs are allocated directly to the benefited land 
we use the specific identification method for the purpose of accumulating costs associated with home and tower construction 
we amortize all applicable land acquisition  land development and related costs both incurred and estimated to be incurred to cost of sales for homes closed based upon the relative sales values of homes expected to be closed in each project 
when a home is closed  we usually have not yet paid all incurred costs necessary to complete the home 
each month we record as a liability and as a charge to cost of sales the amount we have incurred  estimate to be incurred and expect to be paid related to completed homes that have been closed as of the end of that month 
actual costs to complete in the future could differ from our current estimated amounts 
warranty costs 
we establish warranty reserves for traditional and tower residences by charging cost of sales and crediting a warranty liability 
the amounts charged are estimated by management to be adequate to cover expected warranty related costs for materials and labor required under our warranty obligation periods 
we provide our single and multi family home buyers with a one to three year limited warranty for all material and labor and a ten year warranty for certain structural defects 
we provide our tower home buyers a one year warranty for the unit and three year warranty for common elements of the tower 
our warranty cost accruals are based upon our historical warranty cost experience in each market in which we 
table of contents operate and are adjusted as appropriate to reflect qualitative risks associated with the type of homes we build and the geographic areas in which we build them 
actual future warranty costs could differ from our currently estimated amounts 
capitalized interest and real estate taxes 
we capitalize interest  up to an amount not to exceed total interest incurred  and real estate taxes on parcels  lots  towers and amenity facilities the projects while under active development 
the capitalization period ends when the asset is substantially complete and ready for its intended use or sale 
the amount of interest capitalized in an accounting period is determined by applying the company s weighted average annualized interest rate to the amount of accumulated expenditures related to the projects under development during the period 
for homebuilding projects  land sales and amenities conveyed through equity membership sales  capitalized interest and real estate taxes are apportioned on relative sales value and amortized to cost of sales  respectively  with each home closing  land sale or membership sold 
for tower buildings  capitalized interest and real estate taxes are amortized to cost of sales under the percentage of completion method 
for owned and operated assets  capitalized interest and real estate taxes are included in the base cost of the assets and depreciated 
if the various underlying estimates related to interest capitalization and amortization are revised  then more or less interest and real estate taxes would be capitalized and or amortized to cost of sales 
community development district obligations 
in connection with certain development activities  bond financing is utilized in many of our communities to construct on site and off site infrastructure improvements 
some bonds are repaid directly by us while other bonds only require us to pay non ad valorem assessments related to lots not yet delivered to residents 
we also guarantee district shortfalls under certain bond debt service agreements 
in accordance with eitf   accounting for special assessments and tax increment financing entities  we annually estimate the amount of bond obligations that we may be required to fund in the future 
if our estimates of the amount of bond obligations that we may be required to fund are significantly different from actual amounts funded  our real estate inventories and costs of sales may be revised on a prospective basis 
impairment of long lived assets and long lived assets to be disposed of 
real estate inventories considered held for sale including land intended for sale and completed tower residences and homes are carried at the lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell 
property and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation and depreciated on the straight line method over their estimated useful lives 
whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of property and equipment and real estate inventories considered held and used  including land and land improvements  investments in amenities and tower residences and homes under development may not be recoverable  we compare the carrying amount of the asset to the undiscounted expected future cash flows 
if this comparison indicates that the asset is impaired  the amount of the impairment is calculated using discounted expected future cash flows 
if our estimate of the future cash flows is significantly different from actual cash flows  we may prematurely impair the value of the asset  we may underestimate the value of the calculated impairment or we may fail to record an impairment 
goodwill 
goodwill is not subject to amortization and is tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
the impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of the goodwill to its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
several factors are used to evaluate goodwill  including management s plans for future operations  recent operating results and estimated future revenues and costs 
due to the uncertainties associated with such estimates  our conclusion regarding goodwill impairment could change and result in a future goodwill impairment 
litigation 
the company is involved in litigation incidental to its business  the disposition of which is expected to have no material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the company s estimates and assumptions related to these proceedings  or due to the ultimate resolution of the litigation

in  and of revenue and gross margin  respectively  were derived from our combined homebuilding operations 
for  total revenues and net income increased and  respectively 
the increases were driven primarily by our traditional and tower homebuilding and real estate services divisions 
although net income increased only slightly over  gross margins increased due primarily to increased contributions from the traditional homebuilding and real estate services divisions 
gross margins from tower homebuilding  amenities and land sales declined as compared to overall  net income increased slightly due to the increase in gross margin offset by increase in selling  general and administrative costs 
during the fourth quarter of  we settled an internal revenue service examination of our tax returns for the years as a result  we reduced our income tax expense by approximately million 
in  we increased revenue despite a challenging economic environment 
the primary move up home buyer market was strong during in the traditional homebuilding division 
the second home luxury and affordable retirement markets continued to exhibit some weakness  which we believe was a result of an unpredictable stock market  geopolitical risks and an uncertain economic outlook 
as we enter  we expect increased revenues from all lines of business as demand for our products is expected to grow 
assuming the current economic environment continues  including increased consumer confidence  a stronger stock market and stable interest rates  we expect to produce moderately increased levels of earnings 
if economic conditions deteriorate  interest rates increase significantly  the ability to obtain permits and approvals for land development is delayed or adverse legislation or regulations occurs  then it may be difficult to achieve earnings growth 
for  total revenues and net income increased and over  respectively 
we achieved an increase in revenues and earnings driven primarily by a larger number and greater value of sold tower units under construction and higher margins and average selling price in our traditional homebuilding operations 
as of january  we adopted sfas and accordingly  no longer amortize goodwill 
for the year ended december   amortization of goodwill was approximately million 
in march  we issued  shares of common stock in a public offering realizing approximately million in net proceeds 
our operating results for and the issuance of common stock contributed to a increase in shareholders equity to million at december  for and  we recognized million and million  respectively  in expenses related to the write off of unamortized debt issue costs associated with the early repayment of debt

we recorded initial deliveries of homes in three of our communities located in the east central and southwest regions  offset by a decrease in deliveries from two communities closed out in and four communities that were approaching close out in the average selling price per home closed increased as a result of closing a larger proportion of homes in our higher priced communities 
lot revenues increased primarily due to the introduction of a new community and subdivision located in the east central and southeast regions  respectively 
the number of homes closed in our primary move up market increased from  while the number of homes closed in our affordable retirement and luxury second home markets declined and  respectively  from the increase in the primary move up market is attributed to the low interest rate environment and the increase in available product offerings 
the decline in the affordable retirement and luxury second home markets is primarily related to an unpredictable stock market  geopolitical risks and an uncertain economic outlook 
gross margin percentage increased basis points due primarily to an increase in the average selling price per home closed  which reflects the sale of larger homes with more features and  consequently  higher margins 
we also began the initial delivery of high margin units in a community located in the east central region 
contract values of new orders increased due primarily to an increase in the average sales price 
the increase in the average sales price per new order was primarily due to sales in three recently introduced higher priced communities and demand for higher priced homes at certain existing communities 
the increase in backlog contract values primarily reflects a increase in the average sales price of homes under contract to  in compared to  in in  we expect four new communities will begin initial deliveries and two communities will close out 
we do not anticipate that lot revenues will reach the same level achieved in gross margins for this segment are expected to decline slightly primarily due to increasing costs associated with shifting from closed out communities to start up communities and a decrease in high margin lot sales 
we anticipate the average selling price per home closed will increase as we begin to deliver homes from our backlog 
our ability to sell homes and raise home prices in the future may be adversely impacted by any significant declines in economic and stock market conditions or softening in the demand for new home offerings 

table of contents year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues decreased primarily due to the decrease in the number of homes delivered during the period  partially offset by an increase in the average selling price of these homes 
the decrease in deliveries was directly related to reduced sales as a result of the events that occurred on september   which contributed to a decline in the unit backlog at the beginning of compared to the beginning of the average selling price per home closed in the period as compared to increased as a result of closing a larger proportion of homes in our higher priced communities located in the southeast  east central and southwest regions 
lot revenues decreased slightly for the year ended december  as compared to gross margin percentage increased basis points due primarily to our ability to raise home prices  higher margins on options and upgrades  and ongoing initiatives to reduce development and construction costs 
the increase in the contract values of new orders was primarily attributable to the addition of three new communities in the east central  southwest and west central regions  and increased sales at existing communities throughout other regions  offset by the sell out and or reduced available inventory in seven communities throughout our other regions  and slower absorption in our second luxury home tiburon community located in the southwest region 
the average sales price per new order was down slightly due to the mix of units 
the increase in backlog contract values was primarily the result of a unit increase in the number of units in backlog offset by a decrease in the average sales price of homes under contract to  from  the increase in backlog units was primarily attributed to three new selling communities located in the east central  southwest and west central regions 
we serve a broad range of customer segments that are performing well  including the affordable retirement and primary move up markets 
the affordable retirement and primary move up markets new order units increased approximately and  respectively  as compared to the luxury second home market new order units declined approximately in reflecting a softening in demand that we believe is related in general to the current economic and equity market conditions

the tower division expects to increase revenue in with a focus on delivering completed unsold tower units and the initial percentage of completion revenues from new towers 
our ability to sell tower units in the future may be adversely impacted by market conditions that have slowed absorption of higher priced units 

table of contents gross margin percentage declined to from in in addition to the net million increase to our allowance for uncollectability of contracts receivable  the decline in the gross margin percentage was primarily due to an anticipated change in the mix of units sold toward lower priced  lower margin units  and a million increase in warranty and completion costs recorded in related to three recently completed towers 
gross margins in were positively impacted by the initial percentage of completion recognition of one higher priced  higher margin tower located in the southwest region 
gross margins are expected to decline slightly in due primarily to additional incentives to sell completed unsold tower units and a shift to lower priced  lower margin towers 
contract values of new orders increased in due primarily to the conversion to firm contracts of units in five newly introduced towers with a sales value of  or million average selling price compared to units in seven towers with a sales value of  or  average selling price in in addition to the items noted above  favorable period over period comparisons of revenues and contract values of new orders were impacted by the company s business decision to grant rescission on tower units and the default by customers on closing of tower units in the quarter ended september  as previously reported 
the resulting impact reduced revenue and gross margin by million and million  respectively 
the increase in backlog contract values was due primarily to the increase in cumulative contract values as a result of the one bal harbour and veracruz tower contract conversions in offset by the increase in cumulative revenues recognized as a result of the increase in the extent of completion of towers under construction in both periods and the completion and delivery of units in nine completed towers during the increase in cumulative contract values reflects an increase in the average sales price of units in backlog 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues increased due primarily to an increase in the number of towers under construction that qualified for recognition of revenue during the respective periods  offset by a reversal of revenue from two towers discussed below 
we met the requirements for percentage of completion revenue recognition in towers for  as compared to towers in we released seven towers for reservation and commenced construction on nine towers during the increase in revenues was offset by the reversal of million of revenue previously recognized on a total of units located in two towers in our southwest region 
during the third quarter of  we were notified that the purchasers of five units with a contract value of million in a tower located in our southwest region intended to default on their contracts 
we retained deposits totaling million  securing performance of such contracts 
based upon these likely defaults  we reversed the revenue and resulting gross margin previously recognized on these five units  net of forfeited deposits  which had an approximate million impact on gross margin 
additionally  earlier in during the course of construction of an unit tower located in our southwest region  we failed to include the proper notification required under florida administrative rules when sending out amendments of condominium documents to purchasers 
this required notice was given to the purchasers of the units at the end of the third quarter  affording them a day right to rescind their contracts 
of the units  were previously subject to sales contracts aggregating million 
because of the deterioration in economic conditions since mid  purchasers of all units exercised their rescission rights 
the company subsequently elected to cancel these contracts based on our business decision to improve customer satisfaction in the community 
based upon the foregoing  we reversed the revenue and resulting gross margin previously recognized on these units during the third quarter  resulting in a reduction of revenue and gross margin in the amounts of million and million  respectively 
gross margin percentage decreased to from primarily due to an anticipated decline compared to prior periods due to a change in the mix of units sold and in backlog toward a greater proportion of lower priced  lower margin units and the completion during august and september of two high margin towers 
the cancellation and default of contracts as discussed above and the use of selective incentives to spur sales also contributed to this margin reduction 
the decrease in contract values of new orders and average selling price relates to the cancellation and default of contracts for units as discussed above and a shift in product mix toward less expensive tower units being sold compared to the same period in while it was expected that the average selling price for tower units being sold during would be lower than the same period in due to a planned shift of mix of buildings being initially marketed this year  the average selling price was also lower because market conditions accelerated absorption of lower priced units and slowed absorption of higher priced units 
we believe the slowed absorption reflected our customers concerns with the national economy and prolonged stock market uncertainty 

table of contents the decrease in backlog contract values was due to the increased amount of cumulative revenues recognized in the towers under construction  which reflected the advancing percentage of completion of those towers  offset by a increase in the cumulative value of all units under contract with purchasers 
this increase in cumulative contract values reflected a increase in the number of tower units under contract offset by a decrease in the average sales price per unit to million from million 
amenity membership and operations years ended december  dollars in thousands equity membership and marina slip revenues membership dues and amenity service revenues total amenity gross margin amenity gross margin percentage year ended december  compared to year ended december  equity membership and marina slip revenues decreased due to a million decline in marina slip revenues primarily due to the sell out of marina slips at our gulf harbour community that occurred in and a million decline in luxury equity membership sales at our existing amenity clubs 
the decline in equity membership sales was partially mitigated by revenues of million recognized on the sale of all remaining memberships at the deering bay club that occurred in the second quarter of the sale of luxury equity memberships continues to be affected by reduced demand for associated luxury second home residences 
marina slip revenues in will be impacted by the sell out of our jupiter marina project 
membership dues and amenity service revenues decreased primarily due to a million decrease related to the turnover of two clubs located in the southwest region to its members  offset by a million increase in revenues from several new and existing club facilities 
in  we anticipate revenues will increase with the introduction of several new facilities 
the decline in total amenity gross margins was primarily due to the declines in sales of luxury equity memberships and marina slips  and increased start up deficits associated with new amenity operations 
future amenity gross margin may be adversely impacted by the reduced availability of marina slips  slowing demand for equity memberships due to general market conditions and increased start up deficits associated with new amenity operations 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  the decrease in equity membership and marina slip revenues was attributable primarily to the decrease in available marina slips at our gulf harbour and deering bay communities offset by the introduction of a marina slip sales program at the jupiter yacht club and opening of the colony clubhouse 
the decrease in membership dues and amenity service revenues was attributable primarily to the turnover of our gateway golf and country club to its members in december  and the reduction in marina slip rental revenues at gulf harbour due to the slip sales program  offset by revenues from several new club facilities located in the southwest florida region and increase in membership dues as a result of increases in memberships at existing clubs 
the decrease in total amenity gross margin percentage was attributable to a decrease in sales of higher margin equity membership and marina slip sales and higher operating deficits associated with the opening or start up of amenity operations at our new communities

prudential florida wci realty brokerage transaction volume increased to  closings from  and the average brokerage transaction price increased compared to the same period in the increase in gross margin was primarily due to increased efficiency in the real estate brokerage and mortgage banking businesses and prudent cost management in general 
in  we anticipate revenue growth in real estate services primarily due to increased transaction volume and higher average sales prices within the prudential florida wci realty brokerage business and increased capture rates in the mortgage banking and title operations achieved through synergies with our homebuilding and realty brokerage division 
land sales land sales are incidental to our overall operations and are expected to continue in the future  but may significantly fluctuate 
the slight increase in revenues was primarily attributable to the sale of non strategic parcels located in our various regions 
land sales gross margins were million before adjustments of million for community development district obligations and estimated costs to complete development activities in two closed out non homebuilding communities 
gross margins from land sales may increase from if we meet our anticipated sales goals 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  real estate services the increase in revenues was primarily attributed to a million and million increase in brokerage and title revenues  respectively  which was related to an increase in the volume of transactions from third party  non wci homebuilding customers and an increase in the average sales price per transaction 
real estate services gross margin increased basis points primarily due to the growth in volume of transactions and controlling overhead costs in the brokerage operations 
land sales the increase in revenues was primarily attributable to the planned sale of non strategic parcels located in our southwest  southeast and east central regions 
land sales gross margin increased primarily as a result of the sale of selected land parcels obtained in the macarthur land portfolio acquired in  which have subsequently increased in value

table of contents increase in general and administrative g a costs and marketing expenditures  respectively 
g a increased due to an increase in salary  wages and benefits  professional and legal fees and insurance  respectively 
the increase in g a was expected with the planned growth in our business 
marketing expenditures increased primarily due to increased advertising in new and existing communities 
as a percentage of total revenues  sg a was compared to in interest expense  net of capitalization  increased primarily due to a increase in interest incurred 
interest incurred increased primarily as a result of the increase in the weighted average outstanding debt balance for as compared to year ended december  compared to year ended december  certain joint ventures contributed to the decline in equity in earnings from joint ventures including a residential joint venture which was approaching sell out  a golf course development in the initial months of operations and a timeshare joint venture which was in the process of marketing the first phase of development 
the decrease in other income was primarily related to the decline in the sale of non core assets 
in  we recognized approximately million in gains from the sale of non core assets compared to  in selling  general and administrative expenses  including real estate taxes  increased in as compared to the increase was primarily due to increased wages  benefits costs  and administrative expenses associated with the increase in personnel to support our growth  increased sales and marketing expenditures related to newly introduced communities  subdivisions and towers under development  and increases in insurance premiums 
as a percentage of total revenues  sg a increased to in as compared to in interest expense  net of capitalization  decreased in as compared to interest incurred increased primarily due to a marginal increase in our level of debt offset by a decrease in our effective borrowing rate 
interest capitalized increased in as compared to the increase in is primarily due to a greater book value of new and existing properties undergoing active development 
for  we recognized million in expenses related to the write off of unamortized debt issue costs associated with the early repayment of debt 
liquidity and capital resources we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating and investing activities 
we finance our land acquisitions  land improvements  homebuilding  development and construction activities from internally generated funds  credit agreements with financial institutions and other debt 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and million undrawn under our existing senior unsecured credit facility and million committed pursuant to letters of credit 
excluding letters of credit  we had approximately million available to draw under our senior unsecured credit facility at december  for  operating activities provided net cash of million  a million improvement from the million used in operations in we receive net cash proceeds from the sale of homes  tower units  amenity memberships and marina slips and mortgage loans originated by our mortgage banking operations 
in addition  we receive cash proceeds from providing realty brokerage  title  property management and construction management services to our customers 
we used cash in to acquire net inventory additions related to single and multi family home inventories that are under contract for delivery during the next six to twelve months  land acquisitions of approximately million  land improvements  amenity development activities  and additions to tower inventories 
we expect real estate inventories will continue to increase as we are currently searching for and negotiating additional opportunities to obtain control of land for future communities 
cash flows from operating activities were reduced by the million net increase in contracts receivable reflecting the increase in the value of tower units under contract that are now being constructed and that have met the requirements for percentage of completion revenue recognition 
we expect to collect a portion of these receivables during the next three to six months as four towers are planned to be completed  allowing delivery of units to residents 
if we do not collect these contract receivables due to various contingencies  including buyer defaults  we may receive less cash than we expect 
historically  approximately to of firm contacts have resulted in cancellation or default 
future defaults may limit our ability to deliver units from backlog and collect contract receivables upon the completion of towers under construction 

table of contents for  million in cash was used in investing activities compared to million used in investing activities in primarily included million of net additions to property and equipment  million of net additions to mortgage notes receivable and million of net contributions to joint ventures 
the net additions to property and equipment related to the development of a retail office building in the palm beach region and development of two golf courses and club facilities in our southwest region 
the net additions to mortgage notes receivable were related to our financing of several land sales offset by cash collections of million 
we expect to collect the mortgage notes in and contributions to joint ventures were primarily related to our timeshare venture which completed the first phase of development in and is in the sales and marketing phase 
we anticipate cash used in investing activities will continue to increase with development of current and future amenity operations which are owned and operated by the company 
for  financing activities provided net cash of million 
the net cash inflows were primarily related to the million of net proceeds from debt issuance  million of net advances on community development district obligations offset by million of cash used to repurchase shares of common stock 
during  we issued million in senior subordinated debt and million of contingent convertible senior subordinated debt in order to increase our liquidity and fix our long term interest rate exposure 
the net proceeds were used primarily to repay the outstanding balance of the senior unsecured credit facility 
under the million senior subordinated indenture agreement  we are required to maintain certain financial and operational covenants that may limit the company s and its subsidiaries ability to incur additional debt  pay dividends  repurchase capital stock and make investment acquisitions 
as defined in our senior subordinated bond indentures  in order to incur additional debt  we are required to maintain a minimum coverage ratio of to and maximum debt to tangible net worth ratio of to additionally  under the indentures  if our consolidated tangible net worth declines below million for two consecutive quarters we would be required to offer to purchase of the aggregate principal of the notes originally issued 
in april  at the direction of the board of directors  the company completed the repurchase of million shares of common stock in a private transaction for an aggregate purchase price of million 
our senior unsecured credit facility provides for a million revolving loan  which may increase to million if certain conditions are met 
in june  the commitment amount was increased to million 
under the senior unsecured credit facility we are required to maintain an adequate borrowing base 
at december   the borrowing base calculation was in excess of the commitment amount of million

during the course of future operations  we plan to acquire developed and undeveloped land  which will be used in the homebuilding  tower and amenities lines of business 
as of december   excluding land under option which was recorded in accordance with fin  we had option contracts aggregating million  net of deposits  to acquire approximately acres of land 
our contractual obligation with respect to the option contracts is limited to the forfeiture of the related non refundable deposits and or letters of credit 
other purchase obligations principally consist of contractual obligations with third party vendors to provide goods and services to our homebuilding segment our cash requirements for are projected to increase as we continue to develop new communities and fund our growth 
we anticipate moderate usage of our existing senior unsecured credit facility to fund land acquisitions  land development  homebuilding and amenity development 
our real estate development is dependent upon the availability of funds to finance current and future development 
we plan to continue growing and expect to fund this growth through the generation of cash flow from operations  from the availability of funds under our credit facilities  from new construction loans and from future debt and equity offerings 
we believe we have adequate resources and sufficient credit facilities to satisfy our current and reasonably anticipated future requirements to acquire capital assets and land  to develop land improvements and construction activities and to meet any other needs of our business  both on a short and long term basis 
if we do not have sufficient capital resources to fund our development and expansion  projects may be delayed  resulting in possible adverse effects on our results of operations 
no assurance can be given as to the terms  availability or cost of any future financing we may need 
if we are at any time unable to service our debt  refinancing or obtaining additional financing may be required and may not be available or available on terms acceptable to us 
furthermore  considerable economic and political uncertainties could have adverse effects on consumer buying behavior  construction costs  availability of labor and materials and other factors affecting us and the homebuilding industry generally 
off balance sheet arrangements we selectively enter into business relationships through the form of partnerships and joint ventures with unrelated parties 
these partnerships and joint ventures are utilized to acquire  develop  market and operate homebuilding  amenities and real estate services projects 
in connection with the operation of these partnerships and joint ventures  the partners may agree to make additional cash contributions to the partnerships pursuant to the partnership agreements 
we believe that future contributions  if required  will not have a significant impact to our liquidity or financial position 
if we fail to make required contributions  we may lose some or all of our interest in such partnerships or joint ventures 
at december   none of our partnerships or joint ventures had outstanding debt 
however  the partners may agree to incur debt to fund partnership and joint venture operations in the future 
standby letters of credit and performance bonds  issued by third party entities  are used to guarantee our performance under various contracts  principally in connection with the development of our projects and land purchase obligations 
at december   we had approximately million in letters of credit outstanding which expire during performance bonds do not have stated expiration dates  rather  we are released from the bonds as the contractual performance is completed 
these bonds  which approximated million at december   are typically outstanding over a period of approximately one to five years 
inflation our costs of operations may be impacted by inflation to the extent that a strengthening economic environment places upward pressure on the cost of labor and materials 
in addition  certain raw materials used by us in our homebuilding operations are susceptible to commodity price increases 
unless these cost increases are passed on to customers through increased home and service prices  our operating margins may be reduced
