item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operations year ended december  compared with year ended december  during the year ended december   management decided to abandon our memphis facility  resulting in a write down of the unused facility totaling million  which included a reserve of million for future net lease costs 
during the year ended december   a month to month lease with a related party was terminated on a facility resulting in a write off of million for the unamortized leasehold improvements related to the facility 
in june  we subleased the memphis facility for the period july  through september   the end of the lease commitment 
we discontinued all foreign operations in because these operations were substantially shut down in  we incurred no related ongoing losses during the years ended december    and all periods prior to october  have been adjusted for a for stock split on october  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our selected consolidated financial data and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
this section includes forward looking information that involves risks and uncertainties 
see cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by forward looking information due to factors discussed under risk factors  business and elsewhere in this annual report 
overview we are a leading hospital focused clinical reference laboratory  performing highly advanced  clinically useful testing services for hospitals  laboratories and physician specialist communities nationwide 
we believe we offer the most comprehensive menu of esoteric assays in the industry  with a test menu of more than  assays 
many of our tests have been developed through our internal research and development efforts 
esoteric assays are complex  comprehensive or unique tests used to diagnose  evaluate and monitor patients 
these assays are often performed on sophisticated instruments by highly skilled personnel and are therefore offered by a limited number of clinical laboratories 
our primary customers are hospitals  independent clinical laboratories and physicians 
we have aligned our interests with those of hospitals  our fastest growing client segment  by not competing in the routine test market that provides them with a valuable source of revenue 
we educate physicians on the clinical value of our assays through our information oriented marketing campaigns 
our technical  experienced sales force concentrates on the hospitals and independent laboratories that serve as distribution channels for physician assay orders 
we use our advanced information technology solutions to accelerate and automate electronic ordering and results reporting with these customers 
through the execution of our hospital focused strategy  we grew rapidly in recent years 
for the three years through  our net revenue grew at a compounded annual growth rate of 
this growth was supplemented with the acquisition of bbi clinical laboratories  inc bbicl  in the first quarter of bbicl  founded in  was a leading esoteric clinical reference laboratory specializing in infectious disease testing  such as lyme disease and viral hepatitis 
bbicl s primary customers included hospitals  physician specialists  pharmaceutical and diagnostic companies  and other clinical and research laboratories 
while the core hospital focus strategy remains the same  was marked by two significant events the regulatory actions taken by the california department of health services cdhs and the federal centers for medicare medicaid services cms in march and april  respectively  and the announcement of the acquisition of unilab corporation  our largest customer  by quest diagnostics inc  one of our competitors 
as a result of these events  we have experienced a significant reduction in revenues for and these events are discussed below 
on march   cdhs notified us of its intent to impose sanctions of a directed plan of correction  random onsite monitoring  and a civil money penalty based upon deficiencies cited following laboratory inspections conducted during june and october the sanctions were based on findings that we were permitting unlicensed personnel to perform and supervise clinical laboratory testing in violation of california law 
cms separately imposed certain sanctions  including notice of revocation of our clia certificate  cancellation of our approval to receive medicare and medicaid payments for services performed  imposing a civil money penalty of  per day for each day during the sanction period  and imposing a directed plan of correction by which cms could notify our customers of our non compliance and the nature and effective date of any sanctions imposed 
after filing supplemental documentation supporting our compliance with the applicable requirements with cdhs and cms  cdhs conducted additional unannounced inspections  and we provided additional documentation supporting our compliance with cdhs requirements 
by letter dated june   and amended on july   cdhs indicated that we were in substantial compliance with california clinical laboratory law 
cdhs also imposed sanctions of a civil money penalty of  per day for days ie   plus  for the cost of conducting their investigations  and imposed onsite monitoring for three years  including unannounced inspections 
we did not appeal these imposed sanctions 
on july   cms notified us that it had deemed specialty in compliance with all condition level requirements of clia as of june   that specialty s right to bill medicare and medicaid for its testing services was reinstated as of june   and that all actions against our clia certificate were rescinded 
we also did not challenge cms imposition of a monetary fine of  representing  per day during the sanction period 
we believe that the cancellation of our approval to receive medicare and medicaid payments for services performed from february  through june  did not affect testing for medicare and medicaid patients for whom we bill our hospital and other clients  but instead applies only to testing for which we bill the medicare and medicaid programs directly 
on april   quest diagnostics  inc announced that they had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire unilab corporation 
unilab  our largest customer  comprised approximately and of our net revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
as a result  unilab did not renew the three year agreement with us  which expired in october of  and we experienced a significant decline in testing volumes sent to us from unilab after expiration of the contract 
in october  we entered into a new agreement with unilab which allowed for a more orderly reduction of the remaining test volumes 
with the completion of unilab s acquisition in february by quest diagnostics  we were provided notice that unilab would stop sending us certain higher priced tests covered under the new agreement  and these test volumes ended in early april for the year ended december   unilab contributed less than of our net revenue 
as a result of the impact of these significant events on our business  on june   we announced a reduction in workforce totaling as part of an overall restructuring plan 
the plan involved all areas and levels of the company 
in connection with the restructuring effort  we recorded a charge of approximately million in the second quarter of the charge comprised severance payments and related obligations for employees whose positions were eliminated 
during september  as a result of further business review and the refinement of our core strategic business  we eliminated some employee positions primarily in the area of our clinical trials department 
we recorded a restructuring charge of approximately  in the third quarter of the charge comprised severance payments for employees whose positions were eliminated and the write off of certain assets related to our clinical trials business 
in november  in our continuing efforts to manage costs and align our staff with current business levels  we had a reduction in workforce focused primarily on the laboratory 
we recorded a restructuring charge of approximately  in the fourth quarter of  which comprised severance payments for employees whose positions were eliminated and for the write off of certain capitalized costs associated with the delayed move to our new valencia facility and the related termination of the synthetic lease financing arrangement with the banking group led by bnp paribas 
as previously reported  in december  we purchased a acre site in valencia  california and began construction during the second quarter of of a  square foot facility which would enable us to consolidate all of our laboratory and administrative functions in one location 
in october  we announced that we would postpone the move to our new facility in valencia until the second half of accordingly  the construction of the new facility was suspended at completion of the core and shell of the facility  which was substantially completed in january this postponement allowed us to focus on rebuilding client confidence and stabilizing our business by minimizing any disruptions in service to our clients based on planning and executing a move to a new facility during this rebuilding period 
on february   we signed an agreement for the sale and lease back of the valencia facility with lexington corporate properties trust  a real estate investment trust 
under the terms of the agreement  lexington will purchase the existing facility for million and we will complete the construction project and enter a twenty year lease for use and occupancy of the facility 
the sale and lease back transaction is expected to be completed by the end of first quarter of upon satisfaction of the customary conditions  including a due diligence period  final inspections and closing 
lease payments are expected to begin in the third quarter of with construction planned for completion in the third quarter of  the move from the facilities in santa monica to valencia will be conducted in stages beginning in the third quarter of and completing by the second quarter of we do expect to incur incremental costs of approximately million to million for overlapping rents and relocation expenses during the phased relocation process 
for more information  please see risk factors our planned move to valencia  california may divert management attention and may lead to disruptions in our operations and service to our customers 
in march  we completed a million financing transaction 
this credit facility had two components first  we entered into a year lease to finance construction of our new laboratory and headquarters facility in valencia  california  sometimes referred to as a synthetic lease  with a total cost  including financing costs  of up to million  and second  we entered into a million line of credit with the same lenders that provided the lease financing  with proceeds available for general corporate purposes 
this credit facility  arranged by bnp paribas  included union bank  us bank  first union national bank  as co syndication agents  and allied irish banks  manufacturers bank  and bank leumi  usa  as participants 
as a result of our decision to pause construction of the valencia facility and our desire to have on balance sheet financing  we exercised our purchase option in the fourth quarter under the lease finance agreement  paying off the debt so we can obtain title to the ground lease and facility improvements  thus ending the synthetic lease 
subsequently  we also terminated our line of credit with this bank group 
on may   we announced that novation  a national purchasing group for hospitals  discontinued its service agreement with us 
the termination of the agreement was without cause and was effective on july  the original agreement was initiated on may  and provided novation members with access to discounted clinical laboratory services from us 
while we have experienced some loss of novation clients  the exact consequences of the agreement s termination are difficult to predict  particularly since the termination of the contractual relationship with novation does not prevent its members from using our services  and it may take a significant period of time before any individual novation member decides to stop utilizing our services 
other significant developments in the last twelve months included on june   we announced that consorta  inc  a leading group purchasing and resource management company representing more than acute care facilities  had signed a three year agreement with us for clinical reference testing 
the agreement  effective july   provides consorta members access to our comprehensive menu of more than  assays  proprietary client connectivity applications and turnaround time schedules 
on july   we announced the appointment of cynthia k 
french  phd to the position of vice president and chief science officer 
dr 
french has more than years experience as a researcher and business executive in the diagnostic and clinical laboratory industry  and more recently served as senior scientist at quest diagnostics  center for applied technologies until joining specialty 
dr 
french will oversee our research and development program 
in addition  on july   we announced the formation of a scientific advisory board and the appointment of michael g 
douglas  phd as its chairperson 
dr 
douglas currently serves as vice president and chief science officer of novactyl biopharmaceuticals  inc of st 
louis  missouri  and associate vice chancellor and director of the center of technology management  washington university in st 
louis 
dr 
douglas will be responsible for assembling the advisory board and enlisting a panel of experts to advise specialty on its research and assay development efforts 
on july   we announced the signing of a three year service agreement  as the primary reference laboratory  with the university of maryland medical system umms and began receiving patient specimens and testing orders from member hospitals on august  umms is a regional health network comprised of the university of maryland medical center  community and specialty hospitals and outpatient sites for primary and secondary care in the maryland area  with more than  licensed beds 
on august   we announced that we entered into a letter agreement with chiron corporation  of emeryville  california  and a separate settlement and license agreement with the diagnostics division of bayer healthcare llc of tarrytown  new york 
the agreements call for us to make payments to bayer and to chiron for alleged past infringement of several chiron patents by certain hepatitis c virus hcv and human immunodeficiency virus hiv testing performed by us 
we believe the amount of these payments is immaterial to the company s cash position and ongoing operations 
under the agreement with chiron  chiron agreed not to assert its patent rights  or bring any claim against us for any alleged infringement relating to nucleic acid clinical assays for the detection  quantitation  genotyping and or phenotyping of hcv and hiv occurring at any time prior to october  in the agreement with bayer  bayer agreed to indemnify us in the event chiron brings such a suit or claim against us for infringement of chiron s patent rights with respect to hcv and hiv testing during this period 
bayer also provided us with a royalty bearing non exclusive sublicense to perform laboratory developed hcv and hiv nucleic acid assays 
separately  we agreed to modify our supply agreement with bayer to convert to using bayer products  which are licensed under certain chiron patent rights  for hcv and hiv genotyping 
the supply agreement called for the conversion to bayer licensed products to be completed on or before october  on september   we announced the resignation of terrance h 
gregg as a member of our board of directors 
mr 
gregg  a member of the board of directors since june  cited personal and philanthropic commitments for his decision to resign from the board 
the resignation was effective immediately 
our board of directors now consists of a total of seven members  including four independent directors 
on september   we entered into a million asset based credit agreement with cit business credit  a unit of cit group inc the credit facility is secured primarily by accounts receivable  with the availability of funds being commensurate with this asset 
the credit agreement provides us with an initial million line of credit 
the principal amount of borrowings is due three years from the closing date  the date the line of credit matures 
we drew million under this line of credit and added this amount to cash and investments on hand 
on october   we announced the commercial availability of our next generation outreach express  a proprietary  web based laboratory test order and result reporting system 
outreach express gives hospital organizations a cost effective tool for strengthening the laboratory services they provide to physician offices  medical groups and affiliated healthcare organizations 
on november   we announced the availability of an improved genetic screening test for cystic fibrosis cf and cystic fibrosis carrier status 
the test  cystic fibrosis genotypr  offered exclusively by us  screens for of the most clinically important mutations of the cf gene found in us population groups 
the test was developed in collaboration with tm bioscience corporation  a dna based diagnostics company 
critical accounting policies revenue recognition revenue is recognized as services are rendered upon completion of the testing process for a specific customer order for which we have no future performance obligation to the customer  the customer is obligated to pay and the fees are non refundable 
our revenue recognition policies are in compliance with securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
services are provided to certain patients covered by various third party payor programs including medicare and medicaid 
billings for services under third party payor programs are included in net revenue net of allowances for differences between the amounts billed and estimated receipts under such programs 
adjustments to the estimated payment amounts based on final settlement with the third party payor programs are recorded upon settlement 
expense recognition expenses are recognized as incurred and are generally classified as cost of services or selling  general and administrative expenses 
components of cost of services include salaries and employee benefits  research and development costs  supplies and reagents  courier costs  depreciation of laboratory equipment and leasehold improvements 
selling  general and administrative expenses include salaries and employee benefits  sales and marketing  information technology  insurance and bad debt expense 
stock based compensation charges stock based compensation charges represent the difference between the exercise price of options granted  or the price of stock sold to employees and directors  and the deemed fair value of our common stock on the date of grant or sale in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
and its related interpretations 
in the case of options  we recognize this compensation charge over the vesting periods of the options using an accelerated amortization methodology in accordance with financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
for purposes of the period to period comparisons included in results of operations  selling  general and administration expenses exclude these stock based compensation charges  which are reflected as a separate line item 
we have recorded deferred stock based compensation related to unvested stock options granted to employees and directors 
based on the number of outstanding options granted as of december   we expect to amortize approximately  of deferred stock based compensation during we anticipate that the exercise price of stock options granted after the calendar year of will be at the reported market price of our common stock  and therefore no deferred stock based compensation will result from these grants 
off balance sheet arrangements there are no off balance sheet transactions  arrangements or obligations including contingent obligations that have  or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on the company s financial condition  changes in the financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage of net revenue represented by certain items in our consolidated statements of operations 
years ended december  net revenue cost of services selling  general and administrative exclusive of stock based compensation charges credits restructuring charge charge related to regulatory matters operating income loss income loss before income taxes benefits net income loss year ended december  compared with year ended december  net revenue net revenue decreased approximately million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  revenues for the total year of were impacted primarily due to a decline in accession volumes from approximately million for the total year to nearly million for the total year  a decrease of more than 
this year over year decline in accession volume resulted primarily from business loss due to our regulatory matters that were resolved in the third quarter of in addition  with the february completion of quest diagnostics acquisition of unilab corporation  previously our largest customer  we saw a significant decline in accessions from this customer 
for the total year  unilab contributed less than of total net revenue as compared to approximately in we also experienced a decline of approximately in the aggregate average selling price for the year ended december  as compared to the comparable prior year period 
this decline in aggregate average selling price was primarily due to the year over year reduction in independent laboratory business 
in addition during the total year  approximately million of net revenue was not recognized due to the lack of billing rights for medicare and medicaid services 
looking ahead to  we expect net revenue for the total year to be in the range of million to million 
cost of services cost of services  which includes costs for laboratory operations  distribution services  and research and development  decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the comparable prior year period 
this decrease is a result of lower accession volumes  which declined approximately year over year  and resultant reductions in costs for reagents and royalties  laboratory labor  and distribution 
in addition  we were able to decrease our outsourced testing costs by approximately million for the total year as compared to the comparable prior year period 
this decrease was a result of the reinstatement of tests performed by the company after hiring  training  and certifying additional california licensed personnel in the second half of cost of services is expected to increase in as a function of volume growth 
as a percentage of revenue  costs of services decreased to for the year ended december  from for the comparable prior year period  and we expect that costs of services as a percent of revenue will continue to decline in selling  general and administrative expenses exclusive of stock based compensation charges selling  general and administrative expenses s  g a decreased million or to million for the year ended december  from million for the comparable prior year period 
this decrease is a result of continued expense management and includes the benefit of an approximately million reduction in depreciation as we reached full depreciation on certain assets 
in addition  approximately million of the decline resulted from improvement in bad debt performance and certain sales costs that declined commensurate with revenues 
our bad debt performance  as measured as a percentage of net revenue  was for the total year as compared to for the total year this decrease in current year expenses is partially offset by nearly million of one time charges for legal settlement costs  primarily for the bayer and chiron agreements announced on august   and charges for the valencia facility  while the year ended december   s  g a included approximately million of various one time costs 
as a percentage of revenue  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to of revenue for the year as compared to for the comparable prior year period 
while we expect the percentage of s  g a costs to revenue to decline further in  we expect s  g a costs to increase modestly in these increases are due  in part  to increases in depreciation for new information technology applications and equipment and leasehold improvements for the new valencia facility 
in addition  s  g a expenditures are expected in increase for information technology  sales and marketing to support new business growth  and insurance costs  such as workers compensation  professional liability  and directors and officers liability insurance 
stock based compensation charges stock based compensation charges increased from a net credit of approximately  for the year ended december  to a net charge of approximately  for the year ended december  the credit for the year was primarily due to forfeited stock options resulting from the reductions in workforce in june and september of that had the effect of reducing amortization expense 
restructuring charge we recorded no restructuring charge for the year ended december   however million of restructuring charges were incurred in on june   we announced a reduction in workforce of approximately as part of an overall restructuring plan 
in connection with the restructuring effort  we recorded a charge of approximately million during the second quarter of the charge was comprised of severance payments and related obligations for employees whose positions were eliminated 
during september  as a result of further business review and the refinement of our core strategic business  we eliminated some employee positions primarily in the area of our clinical trials department 
we recorded a restructuring charge of  in the third quarter of the charge was comprised of  of severance payments for employees whose positions were eliminated and a  write off of certain assets related to our clinical trials business 
in november  we had a reduction in workforce focused primarily on the laboratory and recorded a restructuring charge of approximately  this charge was comprised of approximately  of severance payments for employees whose positions were eliminated and  for the write off of certain capitalized costs associated with the delayed move to our new valencia facility  and the related termination of the synthetic lease financing arrangement with the banking group led by bnp paribas 
approximately million of severance and related obligations have been paid as of december  the remaining severance of  will be paid in charge related to regulatory matters as a result of the actions taken in april by the federal centers for medicare and medicaid services cms  we recorded a charge of approximately million for the year ended december  of this charge  approximately million was reserved for medicare and medicaid services earned and billed but not collected for the period of february   beginning of the sanction period  to march  and  was reserved for regulatory fines  inspection costs  and related legal expenses 
we recorded no additional charges related to regulatory matters for the year ended december  interest income expense  net net interest income decreased from approximately million to  from the year ending december  to the year ending december  this reduction directly reflects the cash utilized for capital expenditures for the new valencia facility construction and an information technology infrastructure upgrade for our existing facilities coupled with the significant interest rate declines experienced in and resulting in lower interest yields on our investments 
provision for income taxes benefits provision for income taxes benefits was approximately a million benefit for the total year as compared to a million benefit for the comparable prior year period 
this reduction is primarily due to the reduction in pretax losses 
our effective tax rate was approximately for the total year as compared to a for the total year as our loss narrows and we return to profitability  the effective tax rate could fluctuate significantly depending on the exact nature of the operating results 
in addition  due to the size of our deferred tax assets recorded through december   we do not expect to record any additional benefits for income taxes  should they be available 
please see risk factor our effective tax rate may fluctuate and we may not be able to fully realize a portion of our deferred tax assets 
net loss we recorded a net loss of million for the year ended december  as compared to a net loss of million for the comparable prior year period 
this resulted in an improvement of approximately million or 
while net revenue declined million for the total year as compared to the total year  our total costs and expenses declined by million 
a portion of the overall cost reduction was due to significant one time components included in the year ended december   primarily million of restructuring charges and million of charges related to our regulatory matters 
our income tax benefits declined by million for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   a result of a lower pretax loss being recorded and a reduced effective tax rate for the current year 
as a percentage of net revenue  a net loss of was recorded for the year ended december  as compared to a net loss of for the comparable prior year period 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  net revenue net revenue decreased approximately million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  revenues for the current year were impacted primarily from the loss of customers and reduction of customer volumes as a result of the uncertainty related to our regulatory matters that were resolved in the third quarter of the reduction in revenues occurred across our entire customer mix  but was most significant in business from other independent laboratories excluding unilab  our largest customer and physician direct business  which declined by approximately  while testing referred from our hospital clients  declined approximately 
in addition  as a part of the sanctions imposed by the centers for medicare medicaid services cms  we were suspended from receiving reimbursement for medicare and medicaid services for the period of february  through june   and million of net revenue for these services was not recognized in the year 
the year over year revenue decline is reflected in a drop in accession volumes of approximately  as accessions were nearly million for the year ended december  as compared to more than million for the prior year 
this volume decline is coupled with a year over year decline in the aggregate average selling price of nearly 
this drop in the aggregate average selling price is due primarily to our continued client mix shift towards hospital based business and the reduction in independent laboratory business  as revenues from hospitals grew to nearly of total revenues for the year ended december  as compared to approximately for the year ended december  cost of services cost of services  which includes costs for laboratory operations  distribution services  and research and development  increased approximately million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the comparable prior year period 
this increase is primarily the result of operational changes implemented during the year ended december  to ensure compliance with personnel licensing and other regulatory requirements  and to allow for rapid resolution of these regulatory concerns 
as a result  certain cost increases were temporary increases needed for rapid resolution  while other operational changes will have ongoing cost increases 
the most significant temporary cost increase was for outsourced testing 
in april  we suspended more than one thousand tests to ensure full and immediate compliance with personnel licensing requirements for our laboratory 
the orders we continued to receive for the suspended tests were forwarded to other laboratories for processing 
this operational change resulted in an increase of costs for outsourced testing  adding more than million to cost of services in as compared to the prior year period 
with the successful hiring  training  and certification of additional california licensed personnel during third quarter  we reinstated nearly tests as of october  this reinstatement of tests resulted in a significant decline in outsourcing costs for the fourth quarter in addition  we incurred cost increases in associated with the hiring  training  and certification of licensed laboratory personnel  adding approximately million to total cost of services 
also  approximately  of one time costs was incurred in cost of services associated with the subleasing of our memphis facility for the period july  through september  as part of ongoing changes made to ensure compliance with california requirements for licensed personnel  we now only use california licensed clinical laboratory scientists to perform the analytical portions of clinical testing 
this change adds approximately  per quarter of incremental ongoing costs 
for the period ended december   additional costs of approximately million were incurred for this change in personnel as compared to the year these increases are partially offset by lower reagent  distribution and royalty costs due to lower accession volumes 
as a percentage of revenue  cost of services increased to for the year ended december  from from the comparable prior year period 
selling  general and administrative expenses exclusive of stock based compensation charges selling  general and administrative expenses s  g a decreased approximately million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the prior year period 
this decrease is due primarily to a reduction in salary and benefit costs of approximately million as a result of our restructuring and reduction in force announced in june and an approximate million reduction in certain sales and marketing costs  such as commissions and bonuses  that declined commensurate with our lower revenues 
in addition  approximately million of s  g a costs were incurred during the year ended december  for the acquisition and operation of bbi clinical laboratories facility in connecticut  in which we ceased operations in as a percentage of revenue  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to for year as compared to for the comparable prior year period 
stock based compensation charges stock based compensation charges decreased from approximately million for the period ended december  to a net credit of approximately  for the period ended december  this decrease was primarily due to forfeited stock options resulting from the june and november reductions in workforce that had the effect of reducing future amortization 
restructuring charge on june   we announced a reduction in workforce totaling as part of an overall restructuring plan 
in connection with the restructuring effort  we recorded a charge of approximately million in the second quarter of the charge comprised severance payments and related obligations for employees whose positions were eliminated 
during september  as a result of further business review and the refinement of our core strategic business  we eliminated some employee positions primarily in the area of our clinical trials department 
we recorded a restructuring charge of approximately  in the third quarter of the charge comprised  of severance payments for employees whose positions were eliminated and a  write off of certain assets related to our clinical trials business 
in november  in our continuing efforts to manage costs and align our business with current business levels  we had a reduction in workforce focused primarily on the laboratory 
we recorded a restructuring charge of approximately  in the fourth quarter of approximately  of severance payments for employees whose positions were eliminated was recorded as a charge 
in addition  during the fourth quarter  we recorded a charge of  for the write off of certain capitalized costs associated with the delayed move to our new valencia facility  and the related termination of the synthetic lease financing arrangement with the banking group led by bnp paribas 
charge related to regulatory matters in april  we received a letter from cms imposing certain sanctions as a result of laboratory inspections conducted by cdhs in june and october the sanctions included cancellation of medicare and medicaid payments for services performed by the company on and after february  and a civil money penalty of  per day for each day during the sanction period beginning on february  on july  we were informed by cms that it had deemed specialty to be in compliance with all condition level requirements of clia as of june  and that specialty s ability to bill medicare and medicaid for its testing services had been reinstated as of june  in addition  the july letter from cms notified us of a civil money penalty of  per day for each day during the sanction period from february  through june  in order to facilitate an immediate resolution with cms  we elected to withdraw our appeal of the sanctions we filed with cms on april   and we did not seek reimbursement for services performed for beneficiaries of medicare and medicaid during the sanction period of february  through june  we did not challenge cms imposition of a monetary fine of  representing  per day during the sanction period 
we recorded a charge relating to these actions of approximately million for the period ending december  a charge of million is comprised of million to reserve for medicare and medicaid services earned and billed for the period of february  to march  with the remaining balance for regulatory fines  inspection costs  and incremental legal expenses related to the cdhs and cms regulatory actions 
in pursuing patient collections  information was subsequently provided by the patient or our client that the services provided were covered by medicare or medicaid during the period of february through june   resulting in us writing off these receivables 
these write offs along with additional reserves  totaled  and were recorded as a charge during fourth quarter of interest income expense  net net interest income decreased to approximately million for the year ended december  as compared to net interest income of approximately million for the year ended december  the decrease is primarily due to the significant interest rate declines that occurred during  resulting in lower interest yields on our investments coupled with cash utilized to finance our new facility construction and upgrade our information technology infrastructure 
provision for income taxes benefits provision for income taxes benefits was a benefit of approximately million for the year ended december  as compared to million in expense for the year ended december  our effective tax rate for the full year of was as compared to for the prior year period 
the decline in the effective tax rate is a result of certain non deductible costs  such as penalties  incurred in and the limitation of loss deductions in the state of california 
net income loss a net loss of million was recorded for the year ended december  compared to net income of million for the comparable prior year period  a decrease of approximately million 
the decrease is primarily due to significant one time charges including severance costs and related costs due to restructurings and reductions in workforce totaling approximately million  charges related to the cms actions of nearly million  and lost revenues from medicare and medicaid of approximately million 
in addition  these results reflect the impact of increased outsourced testing costs totaling approximately million for as compared to the prior year period 
this decrease in is also related to our year over year reduction of nearly in our aggregate average selling price due to our client mix shift toward hospital based business and the reduction in independent laboratory business 
as a percentage of net revenue  a net loss of was recorded for the year ended december  as compared to net income of for the comparable prior year period 
liquidity and capital resources our cash and cash equivalents combined with short term and long term investments totaled million as of december  as compared to million as of december  this million decrease is the result of our investments in capital expenditures of approximately million  primarily for the new valencia facility and information technology investments that are related to our infrastructure upgrade for our existing facilities and the move of our data center to a third party location 
this decrease in cash was partially offset by the receipt of most of our income tax refunds  as reflected in operating activities  and million in initial borrowings on our line of credit  as reflected in financing activities  during the total year of operating activities for the year ended december  provided net cash of approximately million 
the effect of taxes were the primary contributor  generating cash of approximately million  as million was provided by income tax refunds partially offset by approximately million of deferred income taxes 
the net decrease in the combined accounts payable and accrued liabilities used cash of approximately million  primarily for severance payments 
the net loss of million was offset by depreciation and amortization of million 
for the year ended december   million was used in operating activities 
this net use of cash resulted primarily from the net loss from operations of million offset by million of depreciation and amortization  million of tax benefits generated from the exercise of employee stock options and million of cash provided by accounts receivable collections 
in addition  cash was used as a result of an increase in our tax benefits  as reflected in income taxes refundable of million 
investing activities for the year ended december  used net cash of million as we invested million to complete the core and shell phase of our valencia facility  complete an information technology infrastructure upgrade for our existing facilities  and improve certain core client electronic ordering and resulting applications 
this investment was partially offset by million of cash generated through the sale of investments 
for the year ended december   investing activities provided net cash of million as we repositioned million of short term and long term investments to cash and cash equivalents  partially offset by million increase in capital expenditures 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the prior year period 
for the year  net cash provided by financing activities resulted from borrowings from a new line of credit with cit business credit and the sale of stock to employees through the employee stock purchase plan and the exercise of stock options 
for the year  the million of net cash provided by financing activities was provided through the sale of stock to employees 
on september   we entered into a million asset based credit agreement with cit business credit  a unit of cit group inc the credit facility is secured primarily by accounts receivable  with the availability of funds being commensurate with this asset 
the credit agreement provides us with an initial million line of credit 
the principal amount of borrowings is due three years from the closing date  the date the line of credit matures 
interest is computed and payable monthly 
interest is based on the chase bank rate plus one half percent per annum 
as of december   we had approximately million in outstanding borrowings against the line of credit 
with the resolution of sanctions imposed by cms and cdhs  our focus has been on rebuilding client confidence and stabilizing our business 
to minimize any disruptions in service to our customers based on planning and executing a move to a new facility during the rebuilding period  in october  we announced that we would postpone the move to our new facility in valencia until the second half of accordingly  the construction of the new facility was suspended at completion of the core and shell of the facility  which was substantially completed in january during the construction postponement period  we saw an increase in operating costs to provide security  insurance  maintenance  and funds taxes  in the range of  to  per quarter 
on february   we entered into an agreement for the sale and leaseback of our valencia facility with lexington corporate properties trust  a real estate investment trust 
under the terms of the agreement  lexington will purchase the existing facility for million and we will complete the construction project and enter a twenty year lease for use and occupancy of the facility 
at the closing of the sale  which is expected to be the first quarter of  we will receive more than million  net of transaction expenses 
receipt of the approximately million balance of proceeds is expected by the fourth quarter of  contingent upon the completion of the construction project and the commencement of lease payments to lexington 
lease payments are expected to begin in the third quarter of we expect to incur capital expenditures of approximately million in to complete the construction project 
with construction planned for completion in the third quarter of  the move from the facilities in santa monica to valencia will be conducted in stages beginning in the third quarter of and completing by the second quarter of we do expect to incur incremental costs of approximately million to million for overlapping rents and relocation expenses during the phased relocation process 
we expect existing cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  line of credit  and the sale and lease back arrangement will be sufficient to fund our operations  meet our capital requirements to complete the valencia construction project  support our growth  and allow strategic technology licensing and acquisitions for the next year 
although we believe we have sufficient capital to fund our activities for at least the next twelve months  our future capital requirements may vary materially from those now planned 
it is possible that we may need or elect to raise additional funds to fund our activities beyond the next year or to consummate acquisitions of other businesses  assets or technologies 
we could raise such funds by selling more stock to the public or to selected investors  or by borrowing money 
in addition  even though we may not need additional funds  we may still elect to sell additional equity securities or obtain credit facilities for other reasons 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain additional funds on commercially favorable terms  or at all 
if we raise additional funds by issuing additional equity or convertible debt securities  the ownership percentages of existing shareholders would be reduced 
in addition  the equity or debt securities that we issue may have rights preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock 
contractual obligations in the table below  we set forth our contractual obligations as of december  some of the figures we include in this table are based on management s estimates and assumptions about these obligations  including their duration  the possibility of renewal  anticipated actions by third parties  and other factors 
because these estimates and assumptions are necessarily subjective  the contractual obligations we will actually pay in future periods may vary from those reflected in the table 
payments due by period total and beyond amounts in thousands long term debt   operating lease obligations    purchase commitments      see note to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our long term debt 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our minimum lease commitments under noncancelable operating leases 
the purchase commitments generally relate to the purchase of reagents and supplies to perform our assays and certain information technology contracts 
these obligations are not recorded in our consolidated financial statements until payment occurs 
we expect to fund these commitments with existing cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  and line of credit borrowings 
the amount of obligations shown in the above table are subject to change based on  among other things  the demand for our assays  our laboratory operations not operating in the normal course of business  and the ability of our suppliers to deliver the products as promised 
inflation inflation was not a material factor in either revenue or operating expenses during the past three fiscal years ended december    and subsequent events on february   we entered into an agreement for the sale and leaseback of our valencia facility with lexington corporate properties trust  a real estate investment trust

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at any time  fluctuations in interest rates could effect interest earnings on our cash and cash equivalents and interest expense on our existing line of credit 
we believe that the effect  if any  of reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates on our financial position  results of operations  and cash flows would not be material 
currently  we do not hedge these interest rate exposures 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve capital 
we have not used derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
at december   our holdings  which had an original maturity date of less than days  were classified as cash and cash equivalents on our consolidated balance sheet 
at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  which had a weighted average yield of per annum 
at december   our short term investment balance of million consisted of corporate bonds and government securities with maturity dates less than one year  a weighted average yield per annum of and an average of days until maturity
