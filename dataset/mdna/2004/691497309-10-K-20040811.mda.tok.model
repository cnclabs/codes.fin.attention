fiscal compared to fiscal total company net sales increased from million in fiscal to  million in fiscal we generated a increase in the average selling price per unit and a increase in unit sales 
the increase in the average selling price per unit was due to the higher average selling price per unit of tommy bahama merchandise 
the increase in unit sales was almost entirely due to the acquisition of the tommy bahama group 
our pre acquisition business experienced a decline in the average selling price per unit and an increase of in unit sales 
cost of goods sold for fiscal was million or of net sales  compared to million or of net sales in fiscal the relative decline in cost of goods sold was primarily due to the acquisition of the tommy bahama group with its relatively lower cost of goods sold

selling  general and administrative expenses sg a increased from million or of net sales in fiscal to million or of net sales in fiscal the increase in sg a was primarily due to the acquisition of the tommy bahama group with its relatively higher sg a expense structure  partially offset by the decline in sg a due to the wind down of izod club golf see note h of notes to consolidated financial statements

the effective tax rate was approximately in the fiscal and in fiscal variations in the effective tax rate are primarily attributable to the acquisition of the tommy bahama group and the relative distribution of pre tax earnings among the various taxing jurisdictions in which we operate 
segment results menswear group the menswear group reported a decline in net sales from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decline resulted from a decline in the average selling price per unit partially offset by a increase in unit sales 
an increase in unit sales to the mass merchant distribution channel was largely offset by a decline in sales to sears and the wind down of izod club golf 
the decline in shipments to sears was due to initial shipments to stores in the prior year to establish base inventory levels of lands end merchandise 
the decline in the average selling price per unit was due to product customer mix 
increased sales to mass merchants  with a lower average selling price per unit  replaced sales to distribution channels with a higher average selling price per unit

sales to kmart in fiscal were approximately million compared to none in fiscal our sales to wal mart also declined in fiscal we believe that growth in sales and profitability with wal mart over the next few quarters will be difficult to achieve due to its increasing emphasis on direct sourcing and its planned reduction in its offering of women s apparel 
these sales declines were partially offset by increased sales to other customers in the chain and mass merchant distribution channels 
the decline in the average selling price per unit was primarily due to the product customer mix within the mass merchant distribution channel

cost of goods sold for fiscal was million  or of net sales  compared to million or of net sales in fiscal the relative decline in cost of goods sold was due to the continuation of more cost effective sourcing and improved manufacturing efficiencies 
we were able to obtain product at a lower cost per unit while also satisfying quality standards and time constraints 
reductions in manufacturing capacity in mexico and the caribbean basin and increased sales enabled us to more efficiently utilize our remaining capacity  which helped lower our manufacturing cost per unit

critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the u 
s 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgements that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes  contingencies and litigation and certain other accrued expenses 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
financial reporting release no 
 which was released by the securities and exchange commission  requires all companies to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements 
the detailed summary of significant accounting policies is included in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in this report 
the following is a brief discussion of the more significant accounting policies and methods we use 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable we consider revenue realized or realizable and earned when the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery has occurred  our price to the buyer is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
sales are recorded net of discounts  as well as provisions for estimated returns and allowances 
we estimate returns and allowances on an ongoing basis considering historical and current trends and projected seasonal results 
we record these costs as a reduction to net revenue 
our historical estimates of these sales reductions have not differed materially from actual results 
for accounts receivable  we estimate the net collectibility  considering both historical and anticipated trends of trade discounts and co op advertising deductions taken by our customers  allowances we provide to our retail customers for a variety of reasons  and the possibility of non collection due to the financial position of our customers 
credit losses are charged to sg a 
inventories for segment reporting  inventory is carried at the lower of fifo cost or market 
for wholesale inventory  we estimate the amount of goods that we will not be able to sell in the normal course of business and write down the value of these goods to the recovery value expected to be realized through off price channels yielding a normal gross margin when shipped 
for tommy bahama retail inventory  we provide an allowance for shrinkage and goods expected to be sold below cost 
if we incorrectly anticipate these trends or unexpected events occur  the results of operations could be materially affected 
for consolidated financial reporting  significant portions of our inventory are valued at the lower of lifo cost or market 
lifo inventory calculations are made on a legal entity basis  which do not correspond to our segment definitions 
therefore  lifo inventory accounting adjustments are not allocated to the operating segments 
as part of our lifo accounting  markdowns for inventory valued at lifo cost are deferred until the period in which the goods are sold 
however  in non routine circumstances  such as discontinuance of a product line  markdowns below the allocated lifo reserve are not deferred 
both the lifo reserve and the markdown deferral are reflected in corporate and other 
goodwill the evaluation of the recoverability of goodwill under sfas requires valuations of each applicable underlying business using fair value techniques and market comparable 
these valuations can be significantly affected by estimates of future performance and discount rates over a relatively long period of time  market price valuation multiples and transactions in related markets 
these estimates will likely change over time 
goodwill is required to be evaluated annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may exceed fair value 
if this review indicates an impairment of goodwill balances  the amount of impairment will be recorded immediately and reported as a component of current operations 
the business valuation reviews required by sfas were performed as of the end of the first quarter and indicated that no reduction of the carrying value of goodwill for our business units was required 
intangible assets other than goodwill intangible assets with finite lives are amortized while intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized  but tested at least annually for impairment 
the valuation of the recoverability of indefinite lived intangibles can be significantly impacted by estimates of future cash flows and discount rates over a relatively long period of time  which will likely change over time 
intangible assets whose useful lives are finite are amortized over their useful lives using a method of amortization that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are consumed or otherwise realized 
legal and tax contingencies we are involved in tax and legal proceedings  claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business 
we periodically assess our liabilities and contingencies in connection with these matters  based upon the latest information available 
for those matters where it is probable that we have incurred a loss and the loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated  we have recorded reserves in the consolidated financial statements 
in other instances  because of the uncertainties related to both the probable outcome and amount or range of loss  we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of a liability  if any 
as additional information becomes available  we adjust our assessment and estimates of such liabilities accordingly 
cost of goods sold we include in cost of goods sold all manufacturing and sourcing costs and expenses incurred prior to receipt of finished goods at our distribution facilities 
these costs principally include product cost  inbound freight charges  purchasing costs  internal transfer costs  as well as insurance  duty  brokers fees and consolidators fees 
our gross margins may not be directly comparable to those of our competitors  as income statement classifications of certain expenses may vary by company 
selling  general and administrative expenses we include in sg a  costs incurred subsequent to the receipt of finished goods at our distribution facilities  such as the cost of warehousing  picking  packing  shipping and handling goods for delivery to customers 
in addition  sg a includes product design costs  selling costs  royalty costs  advertising  promoting and marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses 
distribution network costs  including shipping and handling distribution network costs  including shipping and handling  are included as a component of sg a 
revenues received from customers for shipping and handling are included in net revenue 
advertising all costs associated with advertising  promoting and marketing of our products are expensed during the periods when the activities take place 
costs associated with cooperative advertising programs under which we agree to share costs of customers advertising and promotion expenditures are expensed when the related revenues are recognized 
advertising  promotion and marketing expenses are included in sg a 
seasonality although our various product lines are sold on a year round basis  the demand for specific products or styles may be highly seasonal 
for example  the demand for golf and tommy bahama products is higher in the spring and summer seasons 
products are sold prior to each of our retail selling seasons  including spring  summer  fall and holiday 
as the timing of product shipments and other events affecting the retail business may vary  results for any particular quarter may not be indicative of results for the full year 
the percentage of net sales distribution by quarter for fiscal were   and  and the net earnings by quarter for fiscal were   and 
new accounting statements variable interest entities in december  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin 
fin requires that a variable interest entity be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
we determined that we had no interests in variable interest entities 
accordingly  the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
subsequent events on july   we acquired ben sherman limited  which we will operate as part of our menswear group 
ben sherman is a london based designer  distributor and marketer of branded sportswear  accessories  and footwear

the maturity date was extended to july  on july   our ben sherman subsidiary entered into a million senior secured revolving credit facility to provide for seasonal working capital requirements and general corporate purposes 
future liquidity and capital resources cash flow from operations is our primary source of liquidity

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk interest rate risk is managed through the maintenance of a portfolio of variable and fixed rate debt composed of short and long term instruments 
the objective is to maintain a cost effective mix that management deems appropriate 
we do not engage in hedging activities with respect to such risk 
we finance our capital needs through available cash  operating cash flow  letters of credit and bank revolving credit facilities 
at may   we had no variable rate debt 
our average variable rate borrowings for the twelve months ending may  were million  with an average interest rate of 
if the twelve month average interest rate increased by  our interest expense would have changed by thousand 
trade policy risk under the terms of bilateral agreements between most of the major apparel exporting countries and the united states  the importation of most categories of our products is subject to quotas limiting the quantity of such products that may be imported into the united states 
utilization of these quotas is typically controlled at origin by an export license or visa system administered by the exporting country and is monitored and enforced by united states customs and border protection at the time of importation 
since we own or directly control only a small portion of the quota we need  we rely on our suppliers and vendors to secure the visas or licenses required to ship our products 
if our suppliers and vendors fail to secure the necessary visas or licenses as agreed with us  our supply chain could be disrupted 
if an exporting country fails to properly administer its quota and issues visas or export licenses in excess of the quantity permitted under the terms of its bilateral agreement with the united states  the goods covered by such export license or visa could be denied entry into the united states 
such a denial could disrupt our supply chain 
since the quotas under the bilateral agreements described above are country specific  the united states has established detailed country of origin criteria that a product must meet to be eligible to use a particular country s quota 
if we  or our vendors or suppliers fail to comply with these country of origin requirements or fail to be able to document our compliance with such requirements  our products may be denied entry into the united states 
such a denial could disrupt our supply chain 
the agreement on textiles and clothing among world trade organization wto countries mandates the elimination of textile and apparel product quotas for wto countries  including the united states  on january  as a result  there will be changes in the international textile and apparel trade  which may significantly impact our sourcing patterns  could disrupt our supply chain and could put us at a disadvantage to our competitors 
some of the impact of quota elimination may begin in the latter part of calendar historically  exporting countries have been permitted under the terms of their bilateral agreements with the united states to borrow a limited amount of quota from the following year 
since there will be no quota in  none is available for this type of borrowing in the unavailability of this type of quota borrowing could lead to quota shortages in the latter part of calendar  which could cause disruption in our supply chain 
in addition  notwithstanding quota elimination  under the terms of china s wto accession agreement  the united states and other wto members may re impose quotas on specific categories of products in the event it is determined that imports from china have surged and are threatening to create a market disruption for such categories of products so called safeguard quota 
china is a major source of production for us  and the re imposition of safeguard quotas on china following the elimination of the existing quota regime on january  could cause disruption in our supply chain 
furthermore  under long standing statutory authority applicable to imported goods in general  the united states may unilaterally impose additional duties i when imported merchandise is sold at less than fair value and causes material injury  or threatens to cause material injury  to the domestic industry producing a comparable product generally known as anti dumping duties  or ii when foreign producers receive certain types of governmental subsidies  and when the importation of their subsidized goods causes material injury  or threatens to cause material injury  to the domestic industry producing a comparable product generally known as countervailing duties 
the imposition of anti dumping or countervailing duties on products we import would increase the cost of those products to us 
we may not be able to pass any such cost increase on to our customers 
there are numerous free trade agreements pending  including the united states central american free trade agreement that  if adopted  could put us as a disadvantage to some of our competitors 
foreign currency risk we receive united states dollars for substantially all of our product sales 
substantially all inventory purchases from contract manufacturers throughout the world are also denominated in united states dollars  however  purchase prices for our products may be impacted by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the united states dollar and the local currencies of the contract manufacturers  which may have the effect of increasing our cost of goods sold in the future 
during the last three fiscal years  exchange rate fluctuations have not had a material impact on our inventory costs  however  due to the number of currencies involved and the fact that not all foreign currencies react in the same manner against the united states dollar  we cannot quantify in any meaningful way the potential effect of such fluctuations on future income 
we did not engage in hedging activities in fiscal  or with respect to such exchange rate risk 
these foreign currency risks are similar to those experienced by our competitors 
in connection with the acquisition of ben sherman  we entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to fix the currency exchange rate between the dollar and the pound sterling from the agreement date until the closing and funding of the acquisition 
the contracts totaled million at an average exchange rate of per 
commodity price risk we are subject to commodity price risk arising from price fluctuations in the market prices of sourced garments or the various raw materials components of our manufactured products 
we are subject to commodity price risk to the extent that any fluctuations in the market prices of our purchased garments and raw materials are not reflected by adjustments in selling prices of our products or if such adjustments significantly trail changes in these costs 
we neither enter into significant long term sales contracts nor significant long term purchase contracts 
we do not engage in hedging activities with respect to such risk 
inflation risk while the consumer price index has consistently indicated deflation in apparel prices from may through may  this trend appears to be moderating within the last few months 
while this deflationary trend has not affected the tommy bahama products  it has impacted our other businesses as evidenced by the declining average selling price per unit 
inflation deflation risks are managed by each business unit through selective price increases when possible  productivity improvements and cost containment initiatives
