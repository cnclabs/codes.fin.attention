we expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward looking statement to reflect any change in our expectations with regard thereto or any change in events  conditions or circumstances on which any forward looking statement is based 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the results reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and on our future expectations that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
note to our consolidated financial statements contains a summary of our significant accounting policies 
we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition percentage of completion method 
we recognize revenues from significant contracts contracts greater than  and longer than four months in duration and certain automation and controls contracts and orders on the percentage of completion method of accounting 
earned revenue is based on the percentage that costs incurred to date relate to total estimated costs of the project  after giving effect to the most recent estimates of total cost 
the timing of costs incurred  and therefore recognition of revenue  could be affected by various internal or external factors including  but not limited to changes in project scope change orders  changes in productivity  scheduling  the cost and availability of labor  the cost and availability of raw materials  the weather  client delays in providing approvals at benchmark stages of the project and the timing of deliveries from third party providers of key components 
the cumulative impact of revisions in total cost estimates during the progress of work is reflected in the period in which these changes become known 
earned revenue reflects the original contract price adjusted for agreed claims and change order revenues  if applicable 
losses expected to be incurred on the jobs in progress  after consideration of estimated probable minimum recoveries from claims and change orders  are charged to income as soon as such losses are known 
claims for additional contract revenue are recognized if it is probable that the claim will result in additional revenue and the amount can be reliably estimated 
we generally recognize revenue and earnings to which the percentage of completion method applies over a period of two to six or more quarters 
in the event a project is terminated by our customer before completion  our customer is liable for costs incurred under the contract 
we believe that our operating results should be evaluated over a term of several years to evaluate our performance under long term contracts  after all change orders  scope changes and cost recoveries have been negotiated and realized 
we record revenues and profits on all other sales as shipments are made or services are performed 
impairment testing goodwill 
as required by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we evaluate goodwill annually for impairment by comparing the fair value of operating assets to the carrying value of those assets  including any related goodwill 
as required by sfas no 
 we identify separate reportable units for purposes of this evaluation 
in determining carrying value  we segregate assets and liabilities that  to the extent possible  are clearly identifiable by specific reportable unit 
certain corporate and other assets and liabilities  that are not clearly identifiable by specific reportable unit  are allocated in accordance with the standard 
fair value is determined by discounting projected future cash flows at our cost of capital rate  as calculated 
the fair value is then compared to the carrying value of the reportable unit to determine whether or not impairment has occurred at the reportable unit level 
in the event an impairment is indicated  an additional test is performed whereby an implied fair value of goodwill is determined through an allocation of the fair value to the reporting unit s assets and liabilities  whether recognized or unrecognized  in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation  in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations 
any residual fair value after this purchase price allocation would be assumed to relate to goodwill 
if the carrying value of the goodwill exceeded the residual fair value  we would record an impairment charge for that amount 
net goodwill was million at december  we tested goodwill for impairment as required by sfas no 
at december   and we did not record an impairment charge as a result of this testing 
deferred income tax assets valuation allowance 
we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
sfas no 
requires us to provide a valuation allowance for any net deferred income tax assets that we believe will not be utilized through future operations 
for the most recent fiscal years  our canadian subsidiary has recorded net losses  as consolidated  partially due to certain restructuring efforts undertaken in late and early  and the impact of certain foreign currency transactions 
as a result of these losses  we recorded a  valuation allowance at december  to fully reserve for the net deferred tax asset at this subsidiary 
we have a  valuation allowance related to the realizability of certain net operating losses related to axsia  and another  related to other foreign operations 
based upon the level of historical taxable income and projected future taxable income over the periods to which our deferred tax assets are deductible  we believe it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefits of these deductible differences  net of the existing valuation allowances at december  however  the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable  and thus the amount of these valuation allowances  could change if future taxable income differs from our projections 
acquisitions in november  we acquired all the outstanding common stock of the cynara company cynara  a designer and manufacturer of specialized production equipment utilizing membrane technology to separate bulk carbon dioxide from natural gas streams  for approximately million   shares of our then outstanding class b common stock and the right to receive additional shares of common stock based upon the financial performance of the cynara assets 
ultimately  we issued  additional shares  as class b common stock to former cynara stockholders under this provision 
all class b common stock automatically converted to common stock  on a share for share basis  on january in march  we acquired all the outstanding share capital of axsia holdings limited  a privately held process and design company based in the united kingdom  for approximately million  net of cash acquired 
axsia specializes in the design and supply of equipment for water re injection systems for oil and gas fields  oily water treatment  oil separation  hydrogen production and other oil and gas processing equipment systems 
this acquisition was financed with borrowings under our term loan and revolving credit facility 
we accounted for each of the above transactions using the purchase method of accounting 
industry and business environment as a leading provider of wellhead process equipment  systems and services used in the production of oil and gas  our revenues and results of operations are closely tied to demand for oil and gas products and spending by oil and gas companies for exploration and development of oil and gas reserves 
these companies generally invest more in exploration and development efforts during periods of favorable oil and gas commodity prices  and invest less during periods of unfavorable oil and gas prices 
as supply and demand change  commodity prices fluctuate producing cyclical trends in the industry 
during periods of lower demand  revenues for service providers such as natco generally decline  as existing projects are completed and new projects are postponed 
during periods of recovery  revenues for service providers can lag behind the industry due to the timing of new project awards 
changes in commodity prices have impacted our business over the past several years 
the following table summarizes the price of domestic crude oil per barrel and the wellhead price of natural gas per thousand cubic feet mcf  as published by the us department of energy  and the number of rotary drilling rigs in operation  as published by baker hughes incorporated  for the most recent five years year ended december  average price of crude oil per barrel in the us us average wellhead price of natural gas per mcf in the us us average us rig us   at december   the spot price of west texas intermediate crude oil was per barrel  the price of natural gas was per mcf  and the us rig count was  at february   the spot price of west texas intermediate crude oil was per barrel  the price of henry hub natural gas was per mcf  as per the new york mercantile exchange  and the us rig count was  per baker hughes incorporated 
these spot prices reflect the overall volatility of oil and gas commodity prices in the current and recent years 
historically  we have viewed operating rig counts as a benchmark of spending in the oil and gas industry for exploration and development efforts 
our traditional equipment sales and services business generally correlates to changes in rig activity  but tends to lag behind the north american rig count trend 
from a longer term perspective  the us department of energy estimates that us demand for and consumption of petroleum and natural gas products will increase through  with higher consumption rates expected worldwide  driven by demand for refined products and the use of natural gas to power plants that generate electricity 
as demand grows and reserves in the united states decline  producers and service providers in the oil and gas industry may continue to rely more heavily on global sources of energy and expansion into new markets 
the industry continues to seek more innovative and technologically efficient means to extract hydrocarbons from existing fields  as production profiles change 
as a result  additional and more complex equipment may be required to produce oil and gas from these fields  especially since many new oil and gas fields produce lower quality or contaminated hydrocarbon streams  requiring more complex production equipment 
in general  these trends should increase the demand for our products and services 
our engineered systems business is impacted largely by the awarding and completion of larger  more complex oil and gas projects  primarily for international offshore locations 
these projects typically have a longer bidding  evaluation  awarding and construction period than our traditional equipment and services business and are more subject to our customers long term view of the oil and gas supply and demand outlook for the related region  as well as expected commodity prices and political or governmental situations 
in recent periods  we have experienced the absence of  delays in  or lack of large international projects with favorable economic terms  which has impacted our engineered systems business results as well as our current level of project bookings for this segment 
during the fourth quarter of and throughout  we streamlined certain of our operations to decrease excess capacity and be more responsive to current market trends  including the closure and consolidation of manufacturing facilities in edmonton  alberta  canada  and covington  louisiana 
furthermore  we reallocated certain internal resources  consolidated certain engineered systems operations in the uk  and closed an engineered systems business development office in singapore 
in december  we placed into service an expansion of our gas processing facilities at sacroc 
this expansion will increase our operating capacity at this facility from mmcf per day to mmcf per day 
our operating agreement for this facility provides for daily processing minimums  and we project that this operation will contribute significantly to earnings and cash flows for compared to therefore  we expect a larger percentage of our revenues and margins in  compared to  to be attributable to our co gas processing business  a component of our north american operations segment 
the following discussion of our historical results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
results of operations for the year ended december  in thousands statement of operations data revenues    cost of goods sold    gross profit    selling  general and administrative expense    depreciation and amortization expense    closure and other   interest expense    interest cost on postretirement benefit liability interest income other expense  net  income from continuing operations before income taxes and change in accounting principle    for the year ended december  in thousands provision for income taxes    income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle   cumulative effect of change in accounting principle net of income tax benefit of in net income   preferred stock dividends  net income loss available to common stockholders    year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
revenues for the year ended december  decreased million  or  to million  from million for the year ended december  the overall decline in revenues was primarily attributable to a slower than expected recovery in the oil and gas industry  following a downturn in  and the cyclical nature of the industry 
the following table summarizes revenues by business segment for the years ended december  and  respectively for the year ended december  change revenues dollars percentage in thousands  except percentages north american operations    engineered systems    automation and control systems    corporate and inter segment eliminations   total    revenues from our north american operations segment for the year ended december  decreased million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  this decrease was related primarily to a decline in the number of traditional equipment projects in progress in compared to  and a decline in revenues contributed by our operations in mexico and membrane replacement sales for the respective periods 
these declines were partially offset by higher parts and service sales  as well as an increase in revenues derived from our co gas processing business 
the increase in parts and service sales was directly attributable to an increase in oilfield activity in compared to  as the average us rotary rig count increased from for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  revenues from our canadian operations increased during due to several large projects that were completed during the year 
canadian rotary rig counts increased from an average of for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  inter segment revenues for this business segment were approximately million and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
revenues from our engineered systems segment for the year ended december  decreased million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to a decline in the number of large international production system jobs in relative to  partially due to project delays and increased competition 
engineered systems revenues of million for the year ended december  included inter segment revenues of  compared to million of inter segment revenues for the year ended december  revenues from our automation and control systems segment for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily related to a general increase in the number of jobs in progress during compared to  and the completion of several larger projects in inter segment revenues decreased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the change in revenues for corporate and inter segment eliminations represents the elimination of inter segment revenues discussed above 
gross profit 
gross profit for the year ended december  decreased million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenue  gross margins declined from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december   largely due to the decline in margins associated with our north american operations business and an overall decline in sales for the respective periods 
the following table summarizes gross profit by business segment for the years ended december  and  respectively for the year ended december  change gross profit dollars percentage in thousands  except percentages north american operations    engineered systems   automation and control systems   total    gross profit from our north american operations segment for the year ended december  decreased million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  this decrease in gross profit was primarily due to a decline in sales for the segment for the respective period  including a decline in more favorable margin sales related to our latin american operations and our membrane replacement sales  as several higher margin membrane sales were completed in as a percentage of revenue  gross margins for the segment were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
gross profit from our engineered systems segment for the year ended december  decreased  or  to million from million for the year ended december  this decline in gross profit was primarily related to an decline in sales  partially offset by improved overall performance 
as a percentage of revenue  gross margins for this segment were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
gross profit from our automation and control systems segment for the years ended december  and increased  or  to million from million 
this increase was primarily due to a increase in sales for the segment for the respective period  partially offset by an unfavorable mix of projects in and increased competition for jobs in the gulf of mexico 
as a percentage of revenue  gross margins for this segment were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
selling  general and administrative expense 
selling  general and administrative expense for the year ended december  decreased million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  this decrease was largely due to a decline in variable compensation based on operating results and the impact of restructuring activities in canada during the fourth quarter of and other restructuring efforts in the us and uk during the last six months of these expense decreases were partially offset by higher employee medical costs  workers compensation insurance claim costs  higher professional fees and other corporate insurance policies 
overall headcount declined from  employees at december  to  employees at december  depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended december  increased  or  to million from million for the year ended december  the increase in depreciation expense relates to the sacroc gas processing facility expansions 
amortization expense was approximately  for the years ended december  and  and related primarily to patents and other intangible assets 
closure and other 
closure and other charges for the year ended december  of million related to certain restructuring activities in the third quarter of including the closure of a manufacturing facility in covington  louisiana  the consolidation of operations in the uk  and post employment benefits for terminated employees at these locations and at our corporate office 
in addition  costs were incurred related to the closure of our singapore marketing office in the fourth quarter of  including certain lease termination costs and post employment benefits for terminated employees 
during the year ended december   we incurred costs of  related to the closure of a manufacturing and engineering facility in edmonton  alberta  canada 
costs included the involuntary termination of certain employees  relocation of equipment and certain personnel and the modification of related operating lease arrangements 
at december   our remaining accrued liability related to this canadian restructuring effort was  and we incurred additional relocation and shop moving costs totaling  during interest expense 
interest expense for the year ended december  decreased  or  to million from million for the year ended december  this decrease was due to a decline in outstanding debt from million at december  to million at december  the weighted average interest rate of our outstanding borrowings was approximately for the years ended december  and interest cost on postretirement benefit liability 
interest cost on postretirement benefit liability increased  or  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  this increase in interest cost was due to a decrease in the discount rate used to actuarially determine the present value of our postretirement obligation under this arrangement  consistent with a general decline in interest rates in recent years 
other expense  net 
other expense  net of million for the year ended december   increased  or  compared to the year ended december  the change related primarily to net foreign currency losses incurred through our operations in the united kingdom and canada  due to a significant devaluation of the us dollar relative to these foreign currencies during the year ended december  provision for income taxes 
income tax expense for the year ended december  decreased  or  to million from million for the year ended december  this decline in income tax expense was primarily due to a decrease in income before income taxes  which was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in the effective tax rate from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december   was due primarily to the decline in pre tax income  as permanent tax differences represented a greater portion of total taxable income  and a valuation allowance recorded as of december   to reserve for certain deferred tax assets related to our canadian operations 
preferred stock dividends 
we recorded preferred stock dividends totaling million for the year ended december  related to our series b convertible preferred stock  issued to a private investment fund in march year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues

revenues from our engineered systems segment for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to several large projects  primarily in west africa  that provided revenues of approximately million during  offset by a decline in revenues from our uk based operations and a decline in revenues earned in southeast asia  with the substantial completion of the ctoc project in late engineered systems revenues of million for the year ended december  included inter segment revenues of million  as compared to  of inter segment revenues for the year ended december  revenues from our automation and control systems segment for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  the increase was due to higher demand for our control equipment and field services  partially associated with repair projects in the gulf of mexico following several tropical weather systems in inter segment revenues increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the change in revenues for corporate and inter segment eliminations represents the elimination of inter segment revenues as discussed above 
gross profit 
gross profit for the year ended december  decreased million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenue  gross margins declined from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  the following table summarizes gross profit by business segment for the years ended december  and  respectively for the year ended december  change gross profit dollars percentage in thousands  except percentages north american operations    engineered systems    automation and control systems   total    gross profit from our north american operations segment for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  this increase in margin was primarily due to the contribution of our latin american operations and our co gas processing operations and field services  reflecting increased throughput from the expansion at our sacroc facility 
as a percentage of revenue  gross margins for the segment were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
gross profit from our engineered systems segment for the year ended december  decreased million  or  to million from million for the year ended december   despite an increase in revenues 
this decline was due to the completion of several high margin projects during in southeast asia and within our uk based operations  partially offset by new projects for awarded at more traditional margins 
as a percentage of revenue  gross margins for this segment were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
gross profit from our automation and control systems segment for the years ended december  and remained constant  despite a increase in revenues for the period  primarily due to an increase in labor costs attributable to higher medical benefit costs and an unfavorable mix of labor and materials in compared to as a percentage of revenue  gross margins for this segment were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
selling  general and administrative expense 
selling  general and administrative expense for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  this increase was largely related to the following factors one year of operating expenses at axsia during compared to nine months during fiscal  additional costs associated with the start up of the singapore office in march  costs associated with the start up of the mexico marketing office opened in late  and additional costs associated with employee medical claims 
depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended december  decreased million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  depreciation expense for the year ended december  increased  or  to million from million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to the inclusion of depreciation expense on assets acquired through the purchase of axsia in march  and depreciation on assets placed in service in late and  including a significant upgrade of our drying plant facility in pittsburg  california  and the expansion of our gas processing plant at the sacroc field 
amortization expense for the year ended december  decreased million  or  to  from million for the year ended december  this decrease in amortization expense was attributable to a change in accounting method prescribed by sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
this pronouncement  adopted on january   requires that goodwill no longer be amortized over a prescribed period but rather intangible assets not assigned a useful life be evaluated annually for impairment 
see recent accounting pronouncements 
therefore  no goodwill amortization was recorded for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  in addition  the results for the year ended december  include amortization expense associated with certain employment contracts that were fully amortized as of december  closure and other 
closure and other charges for the year ended december  of  related to the closure of a manufacturing and engineering facility in edmonton  alberta  canada 
costs include the involuntary termination of certain employees  relocation of equipment and certain personnel and the modification of related operating lease arrangements 
at december   our remaining accrued liability related to this restructuring was  and we expect to incur additional relocation and shop moving costs  which will expensed as incurred through the second quarter of during the year ended december   we incurred a charge totaling  related to certain restructuring costs to streamline activities and consolidate offices in connection with the acquisition of axsia in march  and an additional  related to our decision to withdraw a private debt offering 
interest expense 
interest expense for the year ended december  decreased  or  to million from million for the year ended december  this decrease was due to a decline in outstanding debt from million at december  to million at december  the weighted average interest rate of our outstanding borrowings remained constant for the respective periods 
interest cost on postretirement benefit liability 
interest cost on postretirement benefit liability decreased  or  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  this decrease in interest cost was due to an amendment to the plan that provides medical and dental coverage to retirees of a predecessor company 
under the amended plan  retirees will bear more cost for coverages  thereby reducing our projected liability and the related interest cost 
interest income 
interest income decreased  or  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  this change in interest income was primarily due to interest earned on a federal income tax refund paid during by the canadian taxing authorities 
other expense  net 
other expense  net of  for the year ended december   declined  or  compared to the year ended december  the change relates primarily to foreign currency gains and losses incurred through our operations in the united kingdom and canada 
provision for income taxes 
income tax expense for the year ended december  decreased million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  this decline in income tax expense was primarily due to a decrease in income before income taxes  which was million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in the effective tax rate from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december   was due primarily to no longer recognizing non deductible goodwill amortization expense  as per sfas no 
 adopted january  liquidity and capital resources as of january   we had cash and working capital of million and million  respectively 
as of december   we had cash and working capital of million and million  respectively  as compared to million and million at december   respectively 
the decline in working capital is primarily due to the change in current maturities of long term debt related to our term loan and revolving credit facility 
the revolving credit facility portion of this loan was to mature on march  effective march   we replaced this facility with a new term loan and revolving credit facility that matures on march   as described in more detail below 
net cash provided by operating activities for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
the increase in net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal was primarily due to a decline in accounts receivable due to increased collection efforts  and an increase in customer advance payments  partially offset by lower net income and a decline in accrued liabilities 
the timing of accounts receivable billings or collections and the receipt of advance payments depends upon agreed project benchmarks for jobs accounted for under the percentage of completion method of accounting  and tends to fluctuate between reporting periods 
net cash used in investing activities for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
the primary use of funds for the year ended december  was for capital expenditures of million  the majority of which related to the expansion of our sacroc gas processing facility  placed in service in december this cost was partially offset by the proceeds from the sale of a building in the uk the primary use of funds for the year ended december  was for capital expenditures of million  largely related to the expansion at sacroc 
the primary use of funds for the year ended december  was for the acquisition of axsia  which required the use of million  and capital expenditures of million  which included the purchase of a manufacturing facility in magnolia  texas  expansion of and improvement to our facilities in new iberia  louisiana  and improvements to our sacroc plant 
funds for the axsia acquisition were borrowed under a million term loan facility 
capital expenditures for fiscal were financed with borrowings under our revolving credit facility and cash generated from current operations 
net cash provided by used in financing activities for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
the primary use of funds for financing activities for the year ended december  was the repayment of long term debt and revolving credit debt of million and million  respectively  as well as million of net benefit costs under a postretirement benefit plan and million of bank overdraft reductions 
these uses of cash for financing activities were largely offset by gross proceeds of million less issuance costs and fair value allocable to related stock warrants  or a net of million  from the issuance of our series b convertible preferred stock  less dividends paid on those shares of million 
the primary use of funds for the year ended december  was the repayment of long term debt of million and benefit payments under our postretirement benefit plan of million  partially offset by long term borrowings of million and a million increase in bank overdrafts 
proceeds from the issuance of our series b convertible preferred stock were used for working capital needs and to fund expansion of the sacroc facility 
the primary source of funds for financing activities during the year ended december   was borrowings of million under the term loan facility  partially offset by principal repayments of million under the term loan facility  net repayments of  under the revolving credit facilities  payments on postretirement benefit liability of million and repayment of short term notes of million 
we maintain revolving credit and term loan facilities  as well as a working capital facility for export sales 
our prior term loan  in effect during  provided an initial million of borrowings and the revolving credit facilities provide for up to million of borrowings in the united states  up to million of borrowings in canada and up to million of borrowings in the united kingdom  subject to borrowing base limitations 
the term loan was to mature on march   and each of the revolving facilities was to mature on march  these facilities were entered into in  and we refer to these facilities as the facilities 
on march   we replaced our term loan and revolving credit facilities with a term loan and revolving credit arrangement that provides for a term loan of million  a us revolving facility with a borrowing capacity of million  a canadian revolving facility with a borrowing capacity of million  and a uk revolving credit facility with a borrowing capacity of million 
all of the borrowing capacities under the revolving credit facilities are subject to borrowing base limitations 
the term loan and revolving facilities provide for interest at a rate based upon the ratio of funded debt to ebitda  as defined in the credit facility ebitda  and ranging from  at our election  a high of libor plus to a low of libor plus or  a high of a base rate plus to a low of a base rate plus 
natco will pay commitment fees related to this facility  based upon the ratio of funded debt to ebitda  on the undrawn portion of the facility 
the term loan and revolving facilities require quarterly payments of million  beginning in june  and mature on march  we intend to borrow funds under the term loan and revolving credit facilities to retire debt outstanding under the term loan and revolving credit facilities as of march  at december   we had borrowings outstanding under the term loan facility of million and borrowings of million outstanding under the revolving credit facilities and had issued million in outstanding letters of credit under these facilities 
amounts borrowed under the term loan portion of the facility bore interest at a rate of per annum 
amounts borrowed under the revolving portion of the facility bore interest at a rate based upon the ratio of funded debt to ebitda  as defined in the credit facility ebitda  and ranged from  at our election  a high of libor plus to a low of libor plus or a high of a base rate plus to a low of a base rate plus 
under the facilities  we were required to pay commitment fees of to per year  depending upon the ratio of funded debt to ebitda  on the undrawn portion of the facility 
as of december   our commitment fees were calculated at a rate of 
in july  our lenders approved the amendment of various provisions of the term loan and revolving credit facility agreement  effective april  this amendment revised certain restrictive debt covenants  modified certain defined terms  allowed for future capital investment in our sacroc co processing facility in west texas  facilitates the issuance of million of subordinated debt  increased the aggregate amount of operating lease expense allowed during a fiscal year and permitted an increase in borrowings under the export sales credit facility  without further consent  up to a maximum of million 
these modifications resulted in higher commitment fee percentages and interest rates than in the original agreements  based on the funded debt to ebitda ratio  as defined in the underlying agreement  as amended 
in july  our lenders approved an amendment of the term loan and revolving credit facilities  effective april  the amendment modified several restrictive covenant terms  including the fixed charge coverage ratio and funded debt to ebitda ratio  each as defined in the agreement

the company met this threshold requirement as of december   and was in compliance with all covenant requirements  as amended  as of that date 
the weighted average interest rate of our borrowings under the term loan and revolving credit agreement on december  was 
we and our operating subsidiaries guarantee our term loan and revolving credit facilities  which are secured by a first lien or first priority security interest in or pledge of substantially all of the assets of the borrowers  including accounts receivable  inventory  equipment  intangibles  equity interests in us subsidiaries and of the equity interest in active  non us subsidiaries 
our assets and those of our active non us subsidiaries secure the us  canadian and us facilities  assets of our canadian subsidiary also secure the canadian facility and assets of our uk subsidiaries also secure the uk facility 
the uk facility is guaranteed by each of our us subsidiaries  while the canadian and us facilities are guaranteed by us  each of our us subsidiaries and the canadian subsidiary or the uk subsidiaries  as applicable 
the term loan and revolving credit facilities contain restrictive covenants similar to those contained in the facilities  including  among others  those that limit the amount of funded debt to ebitda as defined in the facilities  impose a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  a minimum asset coverage ratio and a minimum net worth requirement 
these facilities also restrict payment of dividends by us  other than those with respect to the series b preferred shares 
the export sales credit facility provides for aggregate borrowings of million  subject to borrowing base limitations  of which  was outstanding as of december  in addition  we had issued letters of credit totaling  under the export facility as of that date 
fees related to these letters of credit at december   were approximately of the outstanding balance 
the export sales credit facility is secured by specific project inventory and receivables and is partially guaranteed by the export import bank of the united states 
the export sales credit facility loans mature in july we borrowed million under a long term promissory note arrangement to finance the purchase of a manufacturing facility in magnolia  texas in the fourth quarter of this note accrues interest at the day libor plus per annum  and requires quarterly payments of principal of approximately  and interest for five years beginning may this promissory note is collateralized by our manufacturing facility in magnolia  texas 
we had unsecured letters of credit and bonds totaling  and performance guarantees totaling million at december  commitments and contingencies the following table summarizes our known contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years in thousands long term obligations     capital finance lease obligations operating lease obligations      purchase obligations   other long term liabilities      total      we have no capital lease arrangements as of december  purchase obligations were pursuant to material and equipment purchase orders placed in  with delivery and billing scheduled in approximately million of this balance related to one purchase order 
no significant purchase commitments extended beyond one year 
other long term liabilities represent our postretirement benefit obligation as of december  benefit payments associated with the obligation were estimated based upon actual experience for the year ended december  changes in actuarial assumptions or medical trend rates in subsequent years could cause our liability under this postretirement benefit plan to change 
we have no special purpose entities or unconsolidated affiliates or partnerships 
on march   we issued  shares of series b convertible preferred stock series b preferred shares and warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock  to lime rock partners ii  lp  a private investment fund  for an aggregate sale price of million 
approximately  of the aggregate sale price was allocated to the warrants 
proceeds from the issuance of these securities  net of related estimated issuance costs of approximately  were used to reduce our outstanding revolving debt balances and for other general corporate purposes 
each of the series b preferred shares has a face value of  and pays a cumulative dividend of per annum of face value  which is payable semi annually on june and december of each year  except the initial dividend payment which was paid on july  each of the series b preferred shares is convertible  at the option of the holder  into i a number of shares of common stock equal to the face value of such series b preferred share divided by the conversion price  which was or an aggregate of  shares at december   and ii a cash payment equal to the amount of dividends on such shares that have accrued since the prior semi annual dividend payment date 
as of december   we had no accrued dividends payable related to the series b preferred shares 
during  we paid dividends of million to the holders of the series b preferred shares 
in the event of a change in control  as defined in the certificate of designations for the preferred shares  each holder of the series b preferred shares has the right to convert the series b preferred shares into common stock or to cause us to redeem for cash some or all of the series b preferred shares at an aggregate redemption price equal to the sum of i  adjusted for stock splits  stock dividends  etc 
multiplied by the number of shares to be redeemed  plus ii an amount not less than zero equal to the product of adjusted for stock splits  stock dividends  etc 
multiplied by the aggregate amount of dividends paid in cash since the issuance date  plus any gain on the related stock warrants 
if the holder of the series b preferred shares converts upon a change in control occurring on or before march   the holder would also be entitled to receive cash in an amount equal to the dividends that would have accrued through march  less the sum of the aggregate amount of dividends paid in cash through the date of conversion  and the aggregate amount of dividends accrued in prior periods but not yet paid 
we have the right to redeem the series b preferred shares for cash on or after march   at a redemption price per share equal to the face value of the series b preferred shares plus the amount of dividends that have been accrued but not paid since the most recent semi annual dividend payment date 
we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for certain instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity  on july  under sfas no 
 the series b preferred shares would be classified as permanent equity 
however  due to the cash redemption features upon a change in control as described above  the series b preferred shares do not qualify for permanent equity treatment in accordance with the emerging issues task force topic d classification and measurement of redeemable securities  which specifically requires that permanent equity treatment be precluded for any security with redemption features that are not solely within the control of the issuer 
therefore  we have accounted for the series b preferred shares as temporary equity in the accompanying balance sheet  and have not assigned any value to its right to redeem the series b preferred shares on or after march  if the series b preferred shares are converted under contingent redemption features  any redemption amount greater than carrying value would be recorded as a reduction of income available to common shareholders when the event becomes probable 
if we fail to pay dividends for two consecutive periods or any redemption price due with respect to the series b preferred shares for a period of days following the payment date  we will be in default under the terms of such shares 
during a default period  the dividend rate on the series b preferred shares would increase to  the holders of the series b preferred shares would have the right to elect or appoint a second director to the board of directors and we would be restricted from paying dividends on  or redeeming or acquiring our common or other outstanding stock  with limited exceptions 
if we fail to set aside or make payments in cash of any redemption price due with respect to the series b preferred shares  and the holders elect  our right to redeem the shares may be terminated 
the warrants issued to lime rock partners ii  lp have an exercise price of per share of common stock and expire on march  we can force exercise of the warrants if our common stock trades above per share for consecutive days 
the warrants contain a provision whereby the holder could require us to make a net cash settlement for the warrants in the case of a change in control 
the warrants were deemed to be derivative instruments and  therefore  the warrants were recorded at fair value as of the issuance date 
fair value  as agreed with the counter party to the agreement  was calculated by applying a pricing model that included subjective assumptions for stock volatility  expected term that the warrants would be outstanding  a dividend rate of zero and an overall liquidity factor 
the resulting liability  originally recorded at  was increased to  as of december   as a result of the change in fair value of the warrants 
similarly  changes in fair value in future periods will be recorded in net income during the period of the change 
at january   available borrowing capacity under the term loan and revolving credit agreement and the export sales credit agreement were million and  respectively 
although no assurances can be given  we believe that our operating cash flow  supported by our borrowing capacity  will be adequate to fund operations for the next twelve months 
should we decide to pursue acquisition opportunities  the determination of our ability to finance these acquisitions will be a critical element of the analysis of the opportunities

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our operations are conducted around the world in a number of different countries 
accordingly  our earnings are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the majority of our foreign currency transactions relate to operations in canada and the uk in canada  most contracts are denominated in canadian dollars  and most of the costs incurred are in canadian dollars  which mitigates risks associated with currency fluctuations 
in the uk  many of our sales contracts and material purchases are denominated in a currency other than british pounds sterling  primarily us dollars and euros  whereas our engineering and overhead costs are principally denominated in british pounds sterling 
we attempt to minimize our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk by requiring settlement in our functional currencies  when possible 
however  we do not enter into forward contracts or other currency related derivative hedge arrangements  and we do not currently intend to enter into such contracts or arrangements as part of our currency risk management strategy 
the warrants issued to the holders of our series b preferred shares provide for a net cash settlement in the event of a change in control  as defined in the warrants 
consequently  we use derivative accounting to record the warrant transaction 
the liability representing the fair value of this derivative arrangement was recorded at  as of march   and was adjusted to  as of december   to reflect the projected change in fair value of the warrants during the period  resulting in a  revaluation loss for the period from inception to december  fair value  as agreed with the counter party to the agreement  was based on a pricing model that included subjective assumptions concerning the volatility of our common stock  the expected term that the warrants would be outstanding  an expected dividend rate of zero and an overall liquidity factor 
at each reporting date  the liability will be adjusted to current fair value with any changes in fair value reported in earnings during the period of change 
as such  we may be exposed to certain income fluctuations based upon changes in the fair market value of this liability due to changes in the price of our common stock  as well as other factors 
our financial instruments are subject to changes in interest rates  including our revolving credit and term loan facilities  our working capital facility for export sales and our long term facility secured by our magnolia manufacturing plant 
at december   we had borrowings of million outstanding under the term loan portion of the revolving credit and term loan facilities  at an interest rate of 
borrowings  which bear interest at floating rates  outstanding under the revolving credit agreement at december   totaled million 
as of december   the weighted average interest rate of our borrowings under the revolving credit facilities was 
borrowings of  were outstanding under the working capital facility for export sales at december   and accrue interest at 
borrowings under the long term arrangement secured by our magnolia manufacturing facility totaled million and accrued interest at 
based on past market movements and possible near term market movements  we do not believe that potential near term losses in future earnings  fair values or cash flows from changes in interest rates are likely to be material 
assuming our current level of borrowings  as of december   a basis point increase in interest rates under our variable interest rate facilities would decrease net income and cash flow from operations by  and  respectively 
in the event of an adverse change in interest rates  we could take action to mitigate our exposure 
however  due to the uncertainty of actions that could be taken and the possible effects  this calculation assumes no such actions 
furthermore  this calculation does not consider the effects of a possible change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment
