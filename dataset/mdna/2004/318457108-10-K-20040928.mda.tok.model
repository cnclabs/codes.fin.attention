item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those discussed below and elsewhere in this report  particularly under the caption business risk factors 
general prior to our april  acquisition of usauto holdings  inc  we were engaged in pursuing opportunities to acquire one or more operating companies in order to increase value to existing stockholders and provide us with a new focus and direction 
in addition  we marketed for sale a portfolio of foreclosed real estate 
we will continue to market the remaining real estate held six tracts of land in san antonio  texas and will attempt to sell it on a basis that provides us with the best economic return 
new investments in real estate are not anticipated 
in addition  our acquisition opportunities will most likely be limited to those that would be related to the insurance operations 
as a result of the usauto acquisition  we are now principally a retailer  servicer and underwriter of non standard personal automobile insurance  based in nashville  tennessee 
non standard personal automobile insurance is made available to individuals who are categorized as non standard because of their inability or unwillingness to obtain standard insurance coverage due to various factors  including payment history  payment preference  failure in the past to maintain continuous insurance coverage  driving record and or vehicle type  and in most instances who are required by law to buy a minimum amount of automobile insurance 
as of september   we owned and operated retail locations  staffed by employee agents 
our employee agents exclusively sell insurance products either underwritten or serviced by us 
we currently write non standard personal automobile insurance in seven states georgia  tennessee  alabama  mississippi  ohio  missouri and indiana 
we are also licensed as an insurer in additional states 
our consolidated financial statements now vary in important respects from our historical consolidated financial statements due to the acquisition of usauto 
for the year ended june   the recorded financial results reflect twelve months of our previous operations  but only the two months of results of the insurance operations since the april  acquisition date 
our future operating results will be more reflective of those of a fully integrated retailer  servicer and underwriter of non standard personal automobile insurance 
the acquisition of usauto was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
the consideration consisted of million in cash   shares of our common stock issued at closing and up to an additional  shares that may be issued at a later date if certain financial targets are reached at the end of calendar year the aggregate purchase price of million was allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values as of the date of the acquisition 
total goodwill and identifiable intangible assets recorded from the acquisition were million  which was net of a million reduction in our deferred tax allowance based upon our projections of usauto s future taxable income 
of the purchase price  million was allocated to an identifiable intangible asset relating to future policy renewals existing as of april  this asset is amortizable and resulted in amortization expense of million for the year ended june  amortization expense for the years ended june  and will be million and a million  respectively 
our results for the year ended june  included expenses that will be discontinued as a result of the acquisition of usauto 
these principally include compensation to employees who were terminated in connection with the acquisition 
future periods will also include the cost of the advisory services agreement with an entity controlled by donald j 
edwards  our former chief executive officer  as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
these items have been incorporated into the presentation of pro forma operating results for the years ended june  and  which assume that the acquisition of usauto occurred on july  see note to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents consolidated results of operations overview for the year ended june   the consolidated financial statements include the results of our acquisition activities and the real estate operations for the full year  and the results of our insurance operations for the two months since the date of the usauto acquisition 
in addition to the actual results  we will also discuss pro forma operating results that assume that the usauto acquisition occurred on july  we will also separately discuss both the results of the real estate and corporate activities and the insurance operations 
such segment information is summarized below on both an actual and pro forma basis for the periods presented 
actual pro forma year ended june  year ended june  insurance revenues premiums earned commissions and fees ceding commissions from reinsurer investment income other total revenues expenses losses and loss adjustment expenses operating expenses depreciation and amortization total expenses income before income taxes actual pro forma year ended june  year ended june  real estate and corporate revenues gains on sales of foreclosed real estate investment income other total revenues expenses operating expenses stock based compensation depreciation interest expense total expenses loss income before income taxes our insurance operation derives its revenues from selling  servicing and underwriting non standard personal automobile insurance policies in seven states 
we conduct our underwriting operations through two insurance company subsidiaries  usauto insurance company  inc and village auto insurance company  inc our insurance operations revenues are primarily derived from premiums earned from sales of policies issued by the insurance company subsidiaries  net of the portion of those premiums that are ceded to reinsurers  fee income  which includes policy and installment billing fees on policies written as well as fees for other ancillary services principally a motor club product  
table of contents commission income paid by our reinsurer to us for ceded premiums  and investment income earned on the invested assets of the insurance company subsidiaries 
to a lesser extent  we are also winding down operations in which our managing general agency subsidiaries mga subsidiaries received commissions for selling and servicing policies sold on behalf of third party insurance companies 
the following table presents gross premiums earned by state for the insurance operations separately for policies written by the insurance company subsidiaries and for policies issued by the mga subsidiaries on behalf of other insurance companies  on both an actual and a pro forma basis for the periods presented 
this table is therefore reflective of the total gross premiums serviced by us and under our control 
actual pro forma year ended june  year ended june  insurance company subsidiaries georgia tennessee mississippi ohio missouri indiana total gross premiums earned mga subsidiaries georgia tennessee alabama total gross premiums earned the following table presents net premiums earned by state for the insurance operations on both an actual and a pro forma basis for the periods presented 
this table is reflective of the net underwriting risk retained by us after considering the effects of reinsurance 
note that alabama premiums are assumed by us through a quota share reinsurance contract which was increased from to effective february  actual pro forma year ended june  year ended june  georgia tennessee alabama ohio missouri mississippi indiana total net premiums earned insurance companies present a combined ratio as a measure of their overall underwriting profitability 
the components of the combined ratio are as follows loss ratio loss ratio is the ratio expressed as a percentage of losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred to premiums earned and is a basic element of underwriting profitability 
we calculate this ratio based on all direct and assumed premiums earned  net of ceded reinsurance 
expense ratio expense ratio is the ratio expressed as a percentage of operating expenses to premiums earned 
this is a measurement which illustrates relative management efficiency in administering our operations 
we calculate this ratio on a net basis as a percentage of net premiums earned 
insurance operating expenses are 
table of contents reduced by fee income from insureds and ceding commissions received from our reinsurer as compensation for the costs we incur in servicing this business on their behalf 
combined ratio combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio 
if the combined ratio is at or above  an insurance company cannot be profitable without sufficient investment income 
the following table presents the combined ratios for the insurance operations on both an actual and a pro forma basis for the periods presented 
actual pro forma year ended june  year ended june  loss and loss adjustment expense expense the invested assets of the insurance operations are generally highly liquid and consist substantially of readily marketable  investment grade  tax free  municipal bonds 
at june   approximately of our fixed maturities portfolio was tax exempt 
most securities held are issued by political subdivisions in the states of georgia and tennessee  which enables our insurance company subsidiaries to obtain premium tax credits 
investment income is primarily composed of interest earned on these securities  net of related investment expenses 
realized gains and losses on our investment portfolio may occur from time to time as changes are made to our holdings based upon changes in interest rates and changes in the credit quality of securities held 
the non standard personal automobile insurance industry is cyclical in nature 
in the past  the industry has been characterized by periods of price competition and excess capacity followed by periods of high premium rates and shortages of underwriting capacity 
if new competitors enter this market  existing competitors may attempt to increase market share by lowering rates 
such conditions could lead to reduced prices  which would negatively impact usauto s revenues and profitability 
however  we believe that during and  the underwriting results in the personal automobile insurance industry improved as a result of favorable pricing and competitive conditions that allowed for broad increases in rate levels by insurers 
rates and premium levels for non standard automobile insurance have stabilized during fiscal year ended june  compared with fiscal year ended june  actual consolidated results net loss for the year ended june  was million  as compared to a net loss of million for the year ended june  the prior year s results reflect only real estate operations and the costs associated with acquisition opportunities 
the current year s results are significantly impacted by the inclusion of two months of insurance operating results as well as the severance cost to our former employees 
total severance costs were million 
in addition  we recognized million of expenses in the current year related to stock based compensation  most of which related to stock options which became fully vested upon the termination of employees as a result of the usauto acquisition 
for the year ended june   we also recognized gains on the sale of foreclosed real estate of million versus gains of million in the prior year 
loss per share on a fully diluted basis for the year ended june  was  as compared to a loss of for the year ended june  the net loss for the year ended june  was net of an income tax benefit of million  while no tax benefit was recognized in the prior year as a result of the uncertainty of its utilization 
pro forma consolidated results on a pro forma basis  net income for the year ended june  was million  versus million for the year ended june  pro forma income per share on a fully diluted based for the year ended june  was  as compared to for the year ended june  
table of contents actual results real estate and corporate loss before income taxes for the year ended june  was million versus a loss before income taxes of million for the year ended june  investment income related to cash equivalents decreased to million for the year ended june  versus million for the same period last year 
this decrease is due to lower interest rates and a decrease in the amount of available cash equivalents as a result of the effects of the usauto acquisition 
gains on sales of foreclosed real estate for the year ended june  were million resulting from the sale of a total of ten parcels  as compared to million for the same period last year 
gains on sales of real estate represents proceeds received from the sale of foreclosed real estate in excess of carrying value  less selling costs 
stock based compensation for the year ended june  was million compared to million for the same period last year 
this increase was primarily the result of recognizing the expense for the immediate vesting  upon his termination  of nonqualified stock options granted to our former president and chief executive officer  donald j 
edwards  for an option to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
additionally  this expense also includes the cost associated with an option to purchase  shares granted to mr 
edwards as a result of the rights offering in accordance with the anti dilution terms of his employment agreement  and options to purchase  shares granted to other former employees 
other operating expenses increased for the year ended june  primarily as a result of the million in severance cost to former employees who were terminated as a result of the usauto acquisition 
pro forma results real estate and corporate on a pro forma basis  income before taxes for the year ended june  was million versus a loss before taxes of million for the year ended june  these results exclude compensation of terminated employees and reflect only the real estate operations and costs related to acquisition opportunities 
actual results insurance operations for the two months included in the operating results for the year ended june   the insurance operations recorded income before taxes of million 
the combined ratio for this period was which was comprised of a loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of and an expense ratio of pro forma results insurance operations on a pro forma basis  income before taxes for the year ended june  was million versus million for the year ended june  these results assume that the acquisition had occurred on july  and therefore these results include twelve months of insurance operations 
net premiums earned increased to million for the year ended june  from million for the same period last year 
this increase is primarily related to the fact that more of our insurance business was written through our insurance company subsidiaries than for other insurance companies through our managing general agency operations 
in addition  effective february   we increased our assumed reinsurance percentage from to for our alabama business  which is written through another insurance company since we are not licensed there 
likewise  as a result of shifting the insurance underwriting to our insurance subsidiaries  commissions and fees declined over the same period and ceding commissions from our reinsurer increased 
during the year ended june   the number of sales offices or stores expanded by  increasing from at june  to at june  during the fiscal year ended june   we opened stores 
the stores opened during the fiscal year were profit neutral  but are expected to be profit accretive during the fiscal year 
there were a total of offices open as of september  
table of contents investment income increased as the increase in invested assets more than offset the reduction in yield 
the weighted average investment yield for the portfolio was at june  with a duration of years 
the yield for the comparable lehman brothers municipal bond indices at june  was 
the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio improved from for the year ended june  to for the year ended june  insurance operating expenses increased from million for the year ended june  to million for the year ended june  such increase is primarily due to the increase in net premiums earned 
insurance operating expenses for the year ended june  did include million in costs incurred by usauto as result of its acquisition by us 
fiscal year ended june  compared with fiscal year ended june  actual consolidated results prior to april   our operations consisted solely of acquisition activities and real estate operations 
net loss for the year ended june  was million  as compared to net income of million for the year ended june  investment income on cash equivalents decreased to million for the year ended june  from million for the year ended june  this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in interest rates 
unrestricted cash increased from million at june  to million at june  primarily due to interest earned on unrestricted cash accounts  proceeds from the sale of foreclosed real estate and proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock 
gains on sales of foreclosed real estate were million for the year ended june  as compared to million for the year ended june  the gains on sales of real estate represent proceeds received from the sale of foreclosed real estate in excess of carrying value 
the gains recognized for the years ended june  and were from the sale of acres and acres  respectively  in san antonio  texas 
other operating expenses included compensation expense of million for the year ended june  as compared to million for the year ended june  the increased expense included the addition of salary expense for our president and chief executive officer and two other new employees 
the expense also includes million in stock based compensation resulting from the issuance of common stock to mr 
edwards at a price less than the then current market value  as well as the grant of in the money stock options to mr 
edwards and one other employee 
there was a loss on the write down of foreclosed real estate of million for the year ended june  we recorded a write down on the book values of certain parcels of land in san antonio  texas to adjust for decreased market values on the properties due to a softening of the local real estate market as well as the continued general economic downturn 
no losses on write downs of real estate were recognized in the same period in liquidity and capital resources prior to the usauto acquisition  our historical funding requirements have been operating expenses  including legal  audit  and consulting expenses incurred in connection with evaluation of potential acquisition candidates and other strategic opportunities 
our historical primary sources of funding for operating expenses have been proceeds from the sales of foreclosed real estate  investment income on cash and cash equivalents  and cash on hand 
since the completion of the usauto acquisition  our liquidity and capital resources have become more reflective of those of a fully integrated retailer  servicer  and underwriter of non standard personal automobile insurance 
primary sources of funds are from premiums received  commission and fee income and investment 
table of contents income 
funds are used to pay claims and operating expenses  pay interest and principal repayments under the terms of our loan agreement  and purchase investments 
operating activities for the year ended june  used million of cash compared to million used in the same period last year 
in each of the periods  cash was used for operating expenses  partially offset by investment income and proceeds from the sales of foreclosed real estate 
during the year ended june   cash was also used for the severance costs related to the acquisition of usauto 
however  this period also included the results of insurance company operations since the april  acquisition 
net cash used by investing activities for the year ended june  was million compared to million provided in the same period last year 
during the year ended june   million was used in the acquisition of usauto net of cash received and million was provided from the proceeds of sales of foreclosed real estate versus only million provided in the same period last year 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended june  was million versus million in the same period last year 
during the year ended june   we received net proceeds of million through the issuance of stock in the rights offering on april  the acquisition of usauto  including acquisition expenses  required total cash of million  which came from our cash on hand  as well as a portion of the million net proceeds received from the rights offering 
at closing  we also paid million to extinguish a portion of usauto s debt 
in addition  we used million to increase the statutory capital and surplus of the insurance company subsidiaries 
at june   we had million available in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents outside of the insurance company subsidiaries 
the remaining note payable to a financial institution at june  consisted of a term loan with an unpaid balance of million  that bears interest at libor plus basis points 
the note is payable in scheduled quarterly installments through june  and is secured by the common stock and certain assets of usauto s direct wholly owned subsidiaries 
the term loan contains certain financial covenants and requires usauto to maintain certain financial ratios 
at june   usauto was in compliance with all provisions of the loan agreement  including the financial covenants and ratios  except for a risk based capital ratio and a debt service coverage ratio for which waivers had been obtained 
as a result of the usauto acquisition  we are now part of an insurance holding company system with substantially all of our operations being conducted by our insurance company subsidiaries 
accordingly  the holding company will only receive cash from operating activities as a result of investment income and the ultimate liquidation of our foreclosed real estate held for sale 
cash could be made available through loans from financial institutions  the sale of common stock  and dividends from insurance company subsidiaries 
in addition  as a result of our tax net operating loss carryforwards  taxable income generated by the insurance company subsidiaries will provide cash to the holding company through an intercompany tax allocation agreement through which the insurance company subsidiaries will reimburse the holding company for current tax benefits utilized through recognition of the net operating loss carryforwards 
state insurance laws limit the amount of dividends that may be paid from the insurance company subsidiaries 
these limitations relate to statutory capital and surplus and net income 
in addition  the national association of insurance commissioners model act for risk based capital rbc provides formulas to determine the amount of statutory capital and surplus that an insurance company needs to ensure that it has an acceptable expectation of not becoming financially impaired 
a low rbc ratio would prevent an insurance company from paying dividends 
statutory guidelines suggest that the insurance company subsidiaries should not exceed a ratio of net premiums written to statutory capital and surplus of to we believe that the insurance company subsidiaries have sufficient financial resources available to support their net premium writings in both the short term and the reasonably foreseeable future 
there was a loss for the write down of foreclosed real estate of  for the year ended june  as a result of a write down on the book values of certain parcels of land in san antonio  texas to adjust for 
table of contents decreased market values on the properties due to a softening of the local real estate market 
no losses for write downs of real estate were recognized in the same period in there are six remaining parcels of land remaining to be sold in the san antonio area  totaling acres 
as of august   we have received conditional contracts or letters of intent on properties totaling more than million in book value 
no assurance can be provided  however  that any of these contracts or expressions of interest ultimately will culminate in a successful sale 
we believe that existing cash and investment balances  when combined with anticipated cash flows generated from operations  will be adequate to meet our expected liquidity needs in both the short term and the reasonably foreseeable future 
non renewal of quota share reinsurance as a result of the additional available liquidity to increase the statutory capital and surplus of the insurance company subsidiaries  effective september   we have elected to not renew our quota share reinsurance treaty 
this non renewal will have the effect of eliminating quota share reinsurance on all premiums earned after the non renewal date 
this non renewal will have the effect of recapturing the portion of our net underwriting profit that was ceded to the quota share reinsurer 
in addition  we expect our invested assets to increase which will allow us to earn additional investment income 
likewise  in the future  our consolidated balance sheet will no longer reflect prepaid reinsurance premiums and the reinsurance recoverables and amounts due to reinsurance will decrease significantly 
on a pro forma basis for the year ended june   ceded premiums earned by the reinsurer were million 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes all of our contractual obligations by period as of june  in thousands payments due by period less than more than total year years years years note payable to financial institution operating leases total contractual cash obligations off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements other than operating leases or financing activities with special purpose entities 
critical accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements 
as more information becomes known  these estimates and assumptions could change  thus having an impact on the amounts reported in the future 
the following are considered to be our critical accounting policies valuation of deferred tax asset 
income taxes are maintained in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  whereby deferred income tax assets and liabilities result from temporary differences 
temporary differences are differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and their reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years 
valuation of the deferred tax asset is considered a critical accounting policy because the determination of our ability to utilize the asset involves a number of management assumptions relating to future operations that could materially affect the determination of the ultimate value and  therefore  the carrying amount of our deferred tax asset 

table of contents based on business activity prior to the usauto acquisition  management believed it was more likely than not that we would not realize the benefits of the loss carryforwards 
therefore  a full valuation allowance had been established 
based upon our estimates of our future taxable income after the usauto acquisition  we have reduced our deferred tax valuation allowance by million 
at june   our total gross deferred tax asset is million  and we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately million 
on a net basis  the deferred tax asset is million after an allowance of million 
realization of this deferred tax asset is dependent upon our generation of sufficient taxable income in the future 
if future taxable income is not sufficient to recover the deferred tax assets  the maximum charge to the provision for income taxes will be million 
if we generate sufficient future taxable income to fully utilize the deferred tax assets as of june   the maximum benefit for income taxes will be million 
losses and loss adjustment expense reserves 
months and sometimes years may elapse between the occurrence of an automobile accident covered by one of our insurance policies  the reporting of the accident and the payment of the claim 
we record a liability for estimates of losses that will be paid for accidents that have been reported  which is referred to as case reserves 
in addition  since accidents are not always reported when they occur  we estimate liabilities for accidents that have occurred but have not been reported  which are referred to herein as incurred but not reported  or ibnr reserves 
we are directly liable for loss and loss adjustment expenses under the terms of the insurance policies that the insurance company subsidiaries underwrite 
each of the insurance company subsidiaries establishes a reserve for all of its unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses  including case and ibnr reserves  and estimates for the cost to settle the claims 
we rely primarily on historical loss experience in determining reserve levels  on the assumption that historical loss experience provides a good indication of future loss experience 
we also consider various other factors  such as inflation  claims settlement patterns  legislative activity and litigation trends 
we continually monitor these estimates and as experience develops or new information becomes known  increase or decrease the level of its reserves in the period in which changes to the estimates are determined 
accordingly  the actual losses and loss adjustment expenses may differ materially from the estimates we have recorded 
goodwill and identifiable intangible assets 
the usauto acquisition resulted in goodwill of million  subject to increase in the event additional shares are issued pursuant to the terms of the acquisition 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets of usauto 
the acquisition also resulted in other identifiable intangible assets of million 
as required by sfas no 
 we will perform an annual impairment test of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets 
if impairment indicators exist between the annual testing periods  management will perform an interim impairment test 
should either an annual or interim impairment test determine that the fair value of usauto is below the carrying value  a write down of these assets for usauto will be required 
in evaluating whether impairment exists  management also considers the fair value in excess of the carrying value for certain assets 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard  sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  sfas no 
amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition to the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation 
in addition  sfas no 
amends the disclosure provisions of statement to require disclosure in the summary of significant accounting policies of the effects of an entity s accounting policy with respect to stock based employee compensation on reported net income loss and income loss per share in annual and interim financial statements 
effective july   the company adopted the prospective method provisions of sfas no 
eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  addresses certain aspects of accounting for arrangements in which a vendor performs multiple revenue generating activities 
eitf specifies certain criteria to determine whether multiple revenue generating activities represent one or more units of accounting and how the arrangement consideration should be allocated to the separate units of accounting 
eitf is applicable to revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  management has determined that the adoption of the provisions of eitf did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have an exposure to interest rate risk relating to fixed maturity investments 
changes in market interest rates directly impact the market value of the fixed maturity securities 
some fixed income securities have call or prepayment options 
this subjects us to reinvestment risk as issuers may call their securities  which could result in us reinvesting the proceeds at lower interest rates 
we manage exposure to interest rate risks by adhering to specific guidelines in connection with its investment portfolio 
we exclusively invest in municipal bonds that have been rated a or better by standard poors 
at june   of the portfolio was invested in securities rated aa or better by standard poors and in securities rated a or better by standard poors 
we have not recognized any other than temporary losses on the investment portfolio 
we also utilize the services of a professional fixed income investment manager 
as of june   the impact of an immediate basis point increase in market interest rates on our fixed maturities portfolio would have resulted in an estimated decrease in fair value of  or approximately million 
as of the same date  the impact of an immediate basis point decrease in market interest rates on our fixed maturities portfolio would have resulted in an estimated increase in fair value of  or approximately million
