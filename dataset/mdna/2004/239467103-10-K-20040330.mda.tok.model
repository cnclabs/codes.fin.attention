 in liquidity and capital resources the company s management has pursued a policy of maintaining sufficient liquidity and capital resources in order to assure continued availability of necessary funds for the viability and projected growth of all ongoing projects 
the company maintains its diversified securities portfolio comprised primarily of electric utilities preferred and common stocks 
the income derived from these investments has helped to offset the operating and marketing expenses of developing the blood volume analyzer 
the company has followed a conservative policy of assuring adequate liquidity so that it can expand its marketing  and research development without the necessity of raising additional capital 
the securities in the company s portfolio were selected to provide stability of both income and capital 
at december   the company had  in short term debt vs

in  the company purchased the assets of wellport manufacturing company in rochester  new york 
they had previously manufactured the max tm portion of the injection and collection kit 
the company now manufactures its own collection kit 
the final filling and shipping of the kit is performed by an fda licensed radiopharmaceutical manufacturer 
in  the company leased space in oak ridge  tennessee to manufacture its own bva tm blood volume analyzers 
in  the company anticipated to sell more bva tm s  and therefore contracted for additional space in oak ridge to manufacture the collection kits  as well as have capacity for final assembly and shipping of the bva tm system 
the company has a separate contract with an original equipment manufacturer to manufacture additional blood volume analyzers 
the company is reviewing options to purchase some of the original equipment manufacturers who provide various parts of the bva tm blood volume analyzer system 
the company experimented on a limited basis with independent medical distributors in these marketing attempts did not produce successful results and it motivated the company to employ its own dedicated staff for marketing and sales 
the company believes that as wider acceptance is achieved and blood volume measurement becomes a standard of care for various surgical and medical conditions  independent medical distributors may be effective 
this will initially increase expenses faster than revenues  but it is expected to ultimately result in a more rapid acceptance of the bva tm technology 
the company sells  as well as offers to lease  or rent its blood volume analyzer bva tm as part of an overall marketing plan 
the company  also as part of its marketing program  will loan an instrument for a limited time period  however  facilities evaluating the instrument must pay for the kits 
the company established daxor capital with a relationship through de lage landen 
based in the netherlands  it is one of the largest private banks in the world 
de lage landen has extensive experience in capital equipment leasing through its existing relationships with premier corporations such as toshiba and abbott 
the significance of this relationship is as sales through leases increases  daxor will not have to diminish its capital outlay for equipment as dll will fund the net present value of the lease upon installation of the equipment 
in an effort to obtain the best rates for our clients  the company will also work with other independent leasing firms 
the company is also developing a blood volume laboratory staffing program with one of its clients 
under such program  the company may provide management services as well as equipment services 
with respect to blood banking  recent technological advances have significant potential in proving the safety of blood banking 
a major handicap for the use of frozen blood was the fact that after it was thawed  the blood had to be used within hours 
new technology approved by the fda and utilized by the us military  enables blood to be used for up to weeks after it has been thawed 
the company  in addition to its regular frozen blood banking services  intends to implement this type of program 
this type of program will initially produce a net loss  but the company believes that there is sufficient potential demand that such a program will be self sustaining 
year end finds the company in a satisfactory financial position with adequate funds available for its immediate and anticipated needs 
the company plans its budgetary outlays on the assumption that the raising of additional financial capital may be difficult in the next to years 
the company believes that its present liquidity and assets are more than adequate to sustain the additional expenses associated with an expanding sales and marketing program
