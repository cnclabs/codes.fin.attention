item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations certain factors that may affect future results discussions of certain matters in this annual report on form k may constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities and exchange act of  as amended the exchange act  and as such  may involve risks and uncertainties 
forward looking statements  which are based on certain assumptions and describe future plans  strategies  and expectations  are generally identifiable by the use of words or phrases such as believe  plan  expect  intend  anticipate  estimate  project  forecast  may increase  may fluctuate  may improve and similar expressions or future or conditional verbs such as will  should  would  and could 
in particular  statements contained in this document which are not historical facts including  but not limited to  statements concerning anticipated revenues  anticipated operating expense levels  potential new products and orders  and such expense levels relative to our total revenues constitute forward looking statements and are made under the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of our actual results of operations and financial condition have varied and may in the future vary significantly from those stated in any forward looking statements 
factors that may cause such differences include  without limitation  the availability of capital to fund our future cash needs  reliance on major customers  history of operating losses  market acceptance of our products  technological obsolescence  competition  component supply problems and protection of proprietary information  as well as the accuracy of our internal estimates of revenue and operating expense levels 
for a discussion of these factors and some of the factors that might cause such a difference see also risks factors 
these factors should be considered in evaluating the forward looking statements  and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements 
we do not undertake  and specifically disclaim any obligation  to update any forward looking statements to reflect occurrences or unanticipated events or circumstances after the date of such statements 
critical accounting policies the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to contract revenues  customer programs and incentives  product returns  accounts receivable allowances  inventory valuation allowances  deferred tax asset valuation allowances  recoverability of capitalized software development costs  the value of equity instruments issued for services  the recoverability of goodwill and other intangibles related to acquisitions  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we record estimated reductions to revenue for product returns based primarily on historical return rates  return policies and price protection arrangements 
in addition  we sometimes accept returns for stock balancing and negotiate accommodations to customers  which includes price discounts  credits and returns when demand for specific products fall below expectations 
if market conditions were to decline  we could experience an increase in the volume of returns 
beginning in we recognized contract revenue and profit as work progressed on a long term  fixed price contract using the percentage of completion method  which relies on estimates of total expected contract revenue and costs 
we followed this method since reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and costs applicable to various stages of the contract could be made 
recognized revenues and profit are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion 
revisions in profit estimates are charged to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we assess collectibility based on a number of factors  including credit worthiness and past transaction history with the customer 
although collateral is generally not requested  the company  in certain situations  will require confirmed letters of credit or cash in advance of shipping to its customers 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while we engage in product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates 
should actual product failure rates differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than our projections  additional inventory write downs may be required 
our policy on capitalized software costs determines the timing of our recognition of certain development costs 
in addition  this policy determines whether the cost is classified as development expense or cost of revenues 
we use professional judgment in determining whether development costs meet the criteria for immediate expense or capitalization 
our business acquisitions have resulted in goodwill and other intangible assets  which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment expense that we will incur 
in assessing the recoverability of our goodwill and other intangibles we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded 
we performed our annual impairment assessment of goodwill in the fourth quarter of we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made

these factors indicate that the company may potentially be unable to continue as a going concern 
the consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the company be unable to continue as a going concern 
the company s continuation as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet its obligations on a timely basis  to obtain additional financing as may be required  and ultimately to return to profitability and significant positive cash flows

the loss of this customer will have a material adverse effect on the company s revenues  operating profit and liquidity  especially when compared to the third and fourth quarter of  as the company began its initial shipments to the customer in the third quarter of and continued sales through the fourth quarter for the customer s seasonal holiday sales 
however  as the product was manufactured by one of our contract manufacturers  we were able to meet the customer s requirements without an increase in our staffing and operations

many of these new products are expected to take hold in their respective markets and provide additional revenue to the company in additionally  although no assurances can be given  the company expects to release three more new products in there can be no assurances as to the amount of revenue these new products will produce 
even if the company s new products are introduced as planned and are modestly successful  the company anticipates that its continued significant investment in research and development  primarily in the area of ultra wideband will require the company to find a partner to fund a portion of the continued development and or raise additional funds to support its working capital needs and meet existing debt obligations 
there is no assurance that management s plans will be successful or if successful  that they will result in the company continuing as a going concern 
during the year ended december   focus raised a significant amount of its working capital through the issuance of its common stock 
in july  focus sold  shares of its common stock in a private placement to two independent third parties  receiving net proceeds of approximately  the shares were sold at a discount to the day average closing bid prices of our common stock prior to closing 
in connection with the private placement  focus also issued warrants to purchase  shares of its common stock at an exercise price of per share 
ultimate future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including cash flow from operations  continued progress in research and development programs  competing technological and market developments  and our ability to market our products successfully 
additionally  subsequent to december   the company has announced the acquisition of como and its intent to acquire visual circuits 
the costs associated with these acquisitions  including legal  accounting and associated finder s fees  are expected to exceed  the company believes that it is likely that additional financings will be required in as the company continues to implement its business plan 
as of december   the company had no commitments from any other sources to provide additional equity or debt financing 
as such  there can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be raised

the conversion is expected to occur in march stock issuances although we have been successful in the past in raising sufficient capital to fund our operations  there can be no assurance that we will achieve sustained profitability or obtain sufficient financing in the future to provide the liquidity necessary for us to continue operations 
on july   we completed the sale of  shares of our common stock in a private placement to two independent third party accredited investors  receiving proceeds of approximately  net of offering costs of  the shares were sold at an approximate discount to the day average closing bid prices of our common stock prior to closing 
in connection with the private placement  we issued warrants to the two investors and a placement agent to purchase a total of  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
no compensation expense was recorded given that the warrants were issued in connection with the issuance of common stock 
the securities issued in connection with this transaction were subsequently registered on a form s  deemed effective on september  such proceeds were used for general corporate purposes 
effects of inflation and seasonality we believe that inflation has not had a significant impact on our sales or operating results 
our business generally has a modestly stronger second and third quarter seasonality

under eitf  a liability for an exit cost was recognized at the date of the company s commitment to an exit plan 
the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 
for restructuring activities initiated after december  accordingly  sfas no

 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
fin requires that upon issuance of a guarantee  the guarantor must recognize a liability for the fair value of the obligation it assumes under that guarantee 
the company adopted the disclosure requirements of fin in the current year 
the recognition and measurement provisions will be applied to guarantees issued or modified after december  the adoption did not have a material effect on the company operating results or financial condition 
the fasb issued fin  consolidation of variable interest entities in january  and a revised interpretation of fin fin r in december fin  as modified by fin r  requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
the company has not invested in any entities it believes are variable interest entities for which the company is the primary beneficiary 
as such  the company does not expect the adoption of fin  as modified by fin r to have an impact on its financial position or results of operations

in december  the securities exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab  which codifies  revises and rescinds certain sections of sab  revenue recognition in financial statements  in order to make this interpretive guidance consistent with current authoritative accounting and auditing guidance and sec rules and regulations 
the adoption did not have a material effect on the company s operating results or financial condition 
risk factors you should carefully consider the following risks relating to our business and our common stock  together with the other information described elsewhere in this prospectus 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially affected  the trading price of our common stock could decline  and you might lose all or part of your investment 
risks related to our business we have a long history of operating losses 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of  we incurred net losses of   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
there can be no assurance that we will become profitable 
additionally  our auditors have included an explanatory paragraph in their report on our financial statements for the year ended december  that recurring losses from operations and our accumulated deficit raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
the financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of that uncertainty 
a significant portion of our revenues are from products that are designed for consumer goods that have seasonal sales 
a significant portion of our revenues are subject to risks associated with the sales of certain end products at retail that are seasonal  with a majority of retail sales occurring during the period of september through december 
as a result  our annual operating results with respect to sales of semiconductor chips designed into newly introduced products  including microsoft s xbox depend  in large part  on sales during the relatively brief holiday season 
in january  we announced that we did not expect further orders from microsoft with respect to xbox 
see we depend on a few customers for a high percentage of our revenues and the loss or failure to pay of any one of these customers could result in a substantial decline in our revenues and profits for further information 
we may need to raise additional capital  which will result in further dilution of existing and future stockholders 
historically  we have met our short and long term extra cash needs through debt and the sale of common stock in private placements because cash flow from operations has been insufficient to fund our operations 
set forth below is information regarding net proceeds received recently private offerings of issuance of exercise of stock common stock debt options and warrants fiscal   fiscal   fiscal   future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including cash flow from operations  continued progress in research and development programs  competing technological and market developments  and our ability to market our products successfully 
if we require additional equity or debt financing in the future  there can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be raised 
moreover  any equity financing or convertible debt would result in dilution to our then existing stockholders and could have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock 
furthermore  any additional debt financing may result in higher interest expense 
we anticipate costs associated pending and recently announced acquisitions  including legal  accounting and associated finder s fees to exceed  furthermore  because these businesses are not currently profitable  additional cash may be needed to fund operations 
therefore  we believe additional financings will be required in as of december   we did not have any commitments from any other sources to provide additional equity or debt financing 
in the event we are unable to raise additional capital  we may not be able to fund our operations  which could result in the inability to execute our current business plan 
we are dependent upon a significant stockholder to meet our interim financing needs 
we have relied upon the ability of carl berg  a director and significant owner of the company s common stock for interim financing needs 
as of december   we had an aggregate of approximately million in debt and accrued interest outstanding to mr 
berg 
additionally  mr 
berg has provided samsung semiconductor inc  our contracted asic manufacturer  with a personal guarantee to secure our working capital requirements for asic purchase order fulfillment 
there can be no assurances that mr 
berg will continue to provide such interim financing or personal guarantees  should we need additional funds or increased credit facilities with its vendors 
we have a significant amount of convertible securities that will dilute existing stockholders upon conversion 
at december   we had  and  shares of common and preferred shares issued and outstanding  respectively  and  warrants and  options that are exercisable into shares of common stock 
the  shares of preferred stock are convertible into  shares of the company s voting common stock 
furthermore  we may grant  additional stock options to our employees  officers  directors and consultants under our current stock option plans 
we also may issue additional shares in acquisitions 
any additional grant of options under existing or future plans or issuance of shares in connection with an acquisition will further dilute existing stockholders 
in addition  in september  mr 
berg agreed to convert his approximate million of debt and accrued interest into preferred and common stock on conversion terms agreed to more than two years ago 
as of december   the conversion would result in the issuance of approximately  shares of common stock and  shares of preferred stock convertible into an additional  shares of common stock 
due to a recently negotiated sale of a portion of mr 
berg s position in focus to an institutional investor  the conversion is expected to be completed as soon as practical  but in no event sooner than march   which is six months from the date of the recent sale  the earliest date permitted by sec section b and appropriate securities laws 
any acquisitions of companies or technologies by us  including our proposed acquisition of visual circuits assets  and recently announced acquisition of como computer and motion gmbh may result in distraction of our management and disruptions to our business 
we may acquire or make investments in complementary businesses  technologies  services or products if appropriate opportunities arise  as was the case in january when we announced that we had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire substantially all the assets of visual circuits corporation  and in march when we announced that we had acquired the stock of como computer motion gmbh 
from time to time  we may engage in discussions and negotiations with companies regarding the possibility of its acquiring or investing in their businesses  products  services or technologies 
we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition or investment candidates in the future  or if we do identify suitable candidates  we may not be able to make such acquisitions or investments on commercially acceptable terms or at all 
if we acquire or invest in another company  we could have difficulty assimilating that company s personnel  operations  technology or products and service offerings 
in addition  the key personnel of the acquired company may decide not to work for us 
these difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business  distract our management and employees  increase our expenses and adversely affect the results of operations 
furthermore  we may incur indebtedness or issue equity securities to pay for any future acquisitions and or pay for the legal  accounting or finders fees  typically associated with an acquisition 
the issuance of equity securities could be dilutive to our existing stockholders 
in addition  the accounting treatment for any acquisition transaction may result in significant goodwill  which  if impaired  will negatively affect our consolidated results of operations 
we rely on certain vendors for a significant portion of our manufacturing 
approximately of the components for our products are manufactured on a turnkey basis by three vendors  furthertech company ltd  samsung semiconductor inc  and asemtec corporation 
in addition  certain of our products are assembled by a single vendor in mexico 
if these vendors experience production or shipping problems for any reason  we in turn could experience delays in the production and shipping of the company s products  which would have an adverse effect on its results of operations 
we are dependent on our suppliers 
we purchase all of the company s parts from outside suppliers and from time to time experience delays in obtaining some components or peripheral devices 
additionally  we are dependent on sole source suppliers for certain components 
there can be no assurance that labor problems  supply shortages or product discontinuations will not occur in the future which could significantly increase the cost  or delay shipment  of our products  which in turn could adversely affect our results of operations 
we depend on a few customers for a high percentage of our revenues and the loss or failure to pay of any one of these customers could result in a substantial decline in our revenues and profits 
for the year ended december   one customer represented of our total revenues and of our accounts receivable as of december  we presently have no reason to believe that this customer lacks the financial resources to pay 
we do not have long term contracts requiring any customer to purchase any minimum amount of products 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to receive orders of the same magnitude as in the past from existing customers or will be able to market our current or proposed products to new customers 
however  the loss of any major customers  the failure of any such identified customer to pay us  or to discontinue issuance of additional purchase orders would have a material adverse effect on our revenues  results of operation  and business as a whole absent the timely replacement of the associated revenues and profit margins associated with such business 
furthermore  many of our products are dependent upon the overall success of our customers products  over which we often have no control 
to that point  in january  we were informed that we should not expect further fs chip orders from microsoft for the xbox 
fs orders  which were primarily to microsoft  represented of our revenues for the year ended december  and and of our revenues for the third and fourth quarters of  respectively 
the loss of microsoft orders for the fs will have a material adverse effect on our revenues and operating profit  especially when compared to the third and fourth quarter of  as we began our initial shipments to the customer in the third quarters of and continued sales through the fourth quarter for the customer s seasonal holiday sales 
however  as the product was manufactured by one of our contract manufacturers  we were able to meet the customer s requirements without an increase in our staffing and operations 
although there can be no assurances  we do not anticipate any significant adjustments to our staffing or operations or significant adjustments to the carrying value of our fs inventory  as a result of this loss 
backlog should not be construed as indicative of future revenue or performance 
in the past we have experienced quarterly fluctuations in operating results due to the contractual nature of our business and the consequent timing of product orders 
in addition  we have historically operated with a small amount of backlog and accordingly its revenues in any quarter have been substantially dependent upon orders booked in that quarter 
however  as of december   our total backlog was approximately  compared to  at december  there can be no assurance that the rate of growth in backlog will continue 
for example  on january   we announced that we did not expect further orders from microsoft with respect to xbox 
this will significantly decrease backlog in the near term 
furthermore  only a small portion of our backlog is fully funded and many of its customers have the ability to delay delivery or cancel contracts  therefore  there can be no assurance that orders comprising the backlog will be realized as revenue 
in any event  quarterly sales and operating results will continue to be affected by the volume and timing of contracts received and performed within the quarter  which are difficult to forecast 
any significant deferral or cancellation of a contract could have a material adverse effect on our operating results in any particular period 
because of these factors  the period to period comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily indicative of future performances 
our quarterly financial results are subject to significant fluctuations 
we have been unable in the past to accurately forecast its operating expenses or revenues 
revenues currently depend heavily on volatile customer purchasing patterns 
if actual revenues are less than projected revenues  we may be unable to reduce expenses proportionately  and its operating results  cash flows and liquidity would likely be adversely affected 
our products may become obsolete very quickly 
the computer peripheral markets are characterized by extensive research and development and rapid technological change resulting in short product life cycles 
development by others of new or improved products  processes or technologies may make our products or proposed products obsolete or less competitive 
we must devote substantial efforts and financial resources to enhance our existing products and to develop new products 
there can be no assurance that we will succeed with these efforts 
we may not be able to protect our proprietary information 
as of december   we held four patents and one pending application combining five previous provisional patent applications in the united states 
certain of these patents have also been filed and issued in countries outside the united states 
we treat our technical data as confidential and rely on internal non disclosure safeguards  including confidentiality agreements with employees  and on laws protecting trade secrets  to protect its proprietary information 
there can be no assurance that these measures will adequately protect the confidentiality of our proprietary information or prove valuable in light of future technological developments 
delays in product development could adversely affect our market position or customer relationships 
we have experienced delays in product development in the past and may experience similar delays in the future 
given the short product life cycles in the markets for our products  any delay or unanticipated difficulty associated with new product introductions or product enhancements could cause us to lose customers and damage its competitive position 
prior delays have resulted from numerous factors  such as o changing product specifications  o difficulties in hiring and retaining necessary personnel  o difficulties in reallocating engineering resources and other resource limitations  o difficulties with independent contractors  o changing market or competitive product requirements  o unanticipated engineering complexity  o undetected errors or failures in software and hardware  and o delays in the acceptance or shipment of products by customers 
if we are unable to respond to rapid technological change in a timely manner  then we may lose customers to our competitors 
to remain competitive  we must continue to enhance and improve the responsiveness  functionality and features of our products 
our industry is characterized by rapid technological change  changes in user and customer requirements and preferences and frequent new product and service introductions 
if competitors introduce products and services embodying new technologies  or if new industry standards and practices emerge  then our existing proprietary technology and systems may become obsolete 
future success will depend on our ability to do the following o both license and internally develop leading technologies useful in its business  o enhance existing technologies  o develop new services and technology that address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of prospective customers  and o respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a cost effective and timely basis 
developing proprietary technology entails significant technical and business risks 
we may use new technologies ineffectively  or we may fail to adapt proprietary technology and transaction processing systems to customer requirements or emerging industry standards 
if we face material delays in introducing new services  products and enhancements  then our customers may forego the use of our services and use those of our competitors 
during much of the first half of  our common stock did not meet the minimum bid price requirement to remain listed on the nasdaq smallcap market 
if we were to be delisted  it could make trading in our stock more difficult 
our voting common stock is traded on the nasdaq smallcap market 
there are various quantitative listing requirements for a company to remain listed on the nasdaq smallcap market 
we are required to maintain a minimum bid price of per share for our common stock 
between january  and december   focus voting common stock closed below a share on of trading days 
on march   we were notified by the nasdaq that our common stock did not meet the minimum bid price requirement to remain listed on the nasdaq smallcap market 
however  on may   we received notification from nasdaq that we had regained compliance and the matter was closed 
we must maintain stockholders equity of  at december   we had total stockholders equity of  to the extent we incur net losses and do not raise additional capital  our stockholders equity will be reduced 
if we fail to meet these nasdaq smallcap requirements  our common stock could be delisted  eliminating the only established trading market for our shares 
any sales of our voting common stock at a discount to market may reduce the trading price of its common stock to a level below the nasdaq minimum bid price requirement 
in the event we are delisted from nasdaq  we would be forced to list our shares on the otc electronic bulletin board or some other quotation medium  such as pink sheets  depending on our ability to meet the specific listing requirements of those quotation systems 
as a result an investor might find it more difficult to dispose of  or to obtain accurate price quotations for  such shares 
delisting might also reduce the visibility  liquidity  and price of our voting common stock 
our common stock price is volatile 
the market price for our voting common stock is volatile and has fluctuated significantly to date 
for example  between january  and december   the per share price has fluctuated between and per share  closing at at march  the trading price of our voting common stock is likely to continue to be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors including the following o actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results  o announcements of technological innovations  new sales formats or new products or services by focus or its competitors  o cyclical nature of consumer products using our technology  o changes in financial estimates by us or securities analysts  o changes in the economic performance and or market valuations of other multi media  video scan companies  o announcements by us of significant acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments  o additions or departures of key personnel  o additions or losses of significant customers  and o sales of common stock or issuance of other dilutive securities 
in addition  the securities markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations  and the market prices of the securities of technology companies have been especially volatile 
these broad market and industry factors may adversely affect the market price of common stock  regardless of actual operating performance 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of stock  many companies have been the object of securities class action litigation  including us 
if we are sued in a securities class action  then it could result in additional substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources 
risks related to our industry international sales are subject to significant risk 
our revenues from outside the united states are subject to inherent risks related thereto  including currency rate fluctuations  the general economic and political conditions in each country 
there can be no assurance that the economic crisis and currency issues currently being experienced in certain parts of the world will not reduce demand for our products and therefore have a material adverse effect on our revenue or operating results 
our business is very competitive 
the computer peripheral markets are extremely competitive and are characterized by significant price erosion over the life of a product 
we currently compete with other developers of video conversion products and with video graphic integrated circuit developers 
many of our competitors have greater market recognition and greater financial  technical  marketing and human resources 
although we are not currently aware of any announcements by our competitors that would have a material impact on its operations  there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against existing companies or new entrants to the marketplace 
the video production equipment market is highly competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change  new product development and obsolescence  evolving industry standards and significant price erosion over the life of a product 
competition is fragmented with several hundred manufacturers supplying a variety of products to this market 
we anticipate increased competition in the video post production equipment market from both existing manufacturers and new market entrants 
increased competition could result in price reductions  reduced margins and loss of market share  any of which could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors in this market 
often our competitors have greater financial  technical  marketing  sales and customer support resources  greater name recognition and larger installed customer bases than we possess 
in addition  some of our competitors also offer a wide variety of video equipment  including professional video tape recorders  video cameras and other related equipment 
in some cases  these competitors may have a competitive advantage based upon their ability to bundle their equipment in certain large system sales 
we are exposed to general economic conditions that have resulted in significantly reduced sales levels 
if such adverse economic conditions were to continue or worsen  our business  financial condition and operating results could be adversely impacted 
if the adverse economic conditions in the state of california  the united states and throughout the world economy continue or worsen  we may continue to experience a material adverse impact on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
we continue to take actions and charges to reduce our cost of sales and operating expenses in order to address these adverse conditions 
a prolonged continuation or worsening of sales trends may require additional actions and charges to reduce cost of sales and operating expenses in subsequent quarters 
we may be unable to reduce cost of sales and operating expenses at a rate and to a level consistent with such a future adverse sales environment 
if we must undertake further expense reductions  we may incur significant incremental special charges associated with such expense reductions that are disproportionate to sales  thereby adversely affecting our business  financial condition and operating results 
continuing weakness in the economy could decrease demand for our products  increase delinquencies in payments and otherwise have an adverse impact on our business 
recent corporate bankruptcies  accounting irregularities  and alleged insider wrong doings have negatively affected general confidence in the stock markets and the economy  further depressing the stock market and causing the us congress to enact sweeping legislation 
in an effort to address these growing investor concerns  the us congress passed  and on july   president bush signed into law  the sarbanes oxley act of this sweeping legislation primarily impacts investors  the public accounting profession  public companies  including corporate duties and responsibilities  and securities analysts 
some highlights include establishment of a new independent oversight board for public accounting firms  enhanced disclosure and internal control requirements for public companies and their insiders  required certification by ceo s and cfo s of sec financial filings  prohibitions on certain loans to offices and directors  efforts to curb potential securities analysts conflicts of interest  forfeiture of profits by certain insiders in the event financial statements are restated  enhanced board audit committee requirements  whistleblower protections  and enhanced civil and criminal penalties for violations of securities laws 
such legislation and subsequent regulations will increase the costs of securities law compliance for publicly traded companies such as us 
continued terrorism threats and hostilities in the middle east have had a negative impact on the us economy 
the adverse consequences of war and the effects of terrorism have had a negative affect on the us economy 
further conflicts in the middle east could negatively impact our ability to raise additional funds if needed and our revenues will be adversely affected if consumers and businesses continue to cut back spending 
the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome or other viruses may have a negative impact on our business and results of operations 
the recent outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome  or sars  which has had particular impact in china  hong kong  and singapore  could continue to have a negative effect on our operations 
our operations may be impacted by a number of world health related factors  including  among other things  disrupting operations at our turnkey manufacturer and certain of our distributors and customers located in those areas 
if sars or other viral strains re emerge in the future  our international and domestic sales and operations could be harmed 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our deposits in money market funds  included within cash and cash equivalents on our consolidated balance sheets  and our long term debt 
we place our deposits in money market funds with high credit quality commercial banks 
at december   we had three promissory notes payable to carl berg  a company director and shareholder  totaling  bearing interest at prime plus 
if short term interest rates were to increase basis points basis points equals  the increased interest expense associated with these promissory notes would not have a material impact on our net loss and cash flows 
the table below presents the carrying value  market value and related weighted average interest rates for our cash equivalents and long term debt as of december  in thousands except for average interest rates carrying market average value value interest rate cash and cash equivalents variable rate   promissory notes payable prime plus   foreign currency risk at december   cash and cash equivalents included approximately  on deposit at a commercial bank in germany 
our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to currency fluctuations is depended upon the currency exchange rates 
gains or losses related to foreign exchange currency transactions were not material for the years ended december   and
