item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the st 
joe company is one of florida s largest real estate operating companies 
we have one of the largest inventories of private land suitable for development in the state of florida  with very low cost basis 
the majority of our land is located in northwest florida 
in order to optimize the value of our core real estate assets in northwest florida  our strategic plan calls for us to reposition our timberland holdings for higher and better uses 
we increase the value of our raw land assets  most of which are currently managed as timberland  through the development and subsequent sale of parcels  home sites  and homes  or through the direct sale of unimproved land 
in addition  we reinvest qualifying asset sales proceeds into like kind properties under our tax deferral strategy which has enabled us to create a significant portfolio of commercial rental properties 
we also provide commercial real estate services  including brokerage  property management and construction management 
we have four operating segments community development  commercial real estate development and services  land sales  and forestry 
our community development segment generates revenues from the sale of housing units built by us  the sale of developed home sites  rental income  club operations  investments in limited partnerships and joint ventures  brokerage fees  and management fees 
our commercial real estate development and services segment generates revenues from the rental of properties owned by us  the sale of developed and undeveloped land and in service buildings  realty revenues  consisting of property and asset management fees  construction management fees and lease and sales brokerage commissions  development fees  and investments in limited partnerships and joint ventures 
our land sales segment generates revenues from the sale of parcels of undeveloped land  and the sale of a limited amount of developed rural home sites 
our forestry segment generates revenues from the sale of pulpwood and timber  and the sale of bulk land 
our ability to generate revenues  cash flows and profitability is directly related to the real estate market  primarily in florida  and the economy in general 
considerable economic and political uncertainties exist that could have adverse effects on consumer buying behavior  construction costs  availability of labor and materials and other factors affecting us and the real estate industry in general 
additionally  increases in interest rates could reduce the demand for homes we build  particularly primary housing  commercial properties we develop or sell  and lots we develop 
however  we believe our secondary resort housing markets are less sensitive to changes in interest rates 
we have the ability to mitigate these risks by building to contract as well as building in phases 
management periodically conducts market research in the early stages of a project s development to ensure our product meets expected customer demand 
we also continuously and actively monitor local competitors product offerings to evaluate the competitive position of our products 
real estate market conditions in our regions of development  particularly for residential and resort property in northwest florida  have been exceptionally strong 
these current market conditions place us in an unusually favorable position which may not continue in the future 
however  we believe that long term prospects of job growth  coupled with strong in migration population expansion in florida  indicate that demand levels may remain favorable over at least the next two to five years 
our commercial real estate development and services segment continues to build on strong market interest in northwest florida s retail  office  multi family and other mixed use products caused by historical constraints on supply in the area as well as high interest by developers 
although the timing of transactions in this business is hard to predict  we expect results to be the same as or better than results 
forward looking statements management s discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements  including statements about our beliefs  plans  objectives  goals  expectations  estimates and intentions  as well as trends and uncertainties that could affect our results 
these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based on various factors  many of which are beyond our control 
for additional information concerning these factors and related matters  see risk factors in item of this report 
critical accounting estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances 
additionally  we evaluate the results of these estimates on an on going basis 
management s estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements investment in real estate and cost of real estate sales 
costs associated with a specific real estate project are capitalized once we determine that the project is economically viable 
we capitalize costs directly associated with development and construction of identified real estate projects 
indirect costs that clearly relate to a specific project under development  such as internal costs of a regional project field office  are also capitalized 
we capitalize interest based on the amount of underlying expenditures up to total interest expense  and real estate taxes on real estate projects under development 
if we determine not to complete a project  any previously capitalized costs are expensed 
real estate inventory costs include land and common development costs such as roads  sewers  and amenities  home construction costs  property taxes  capitalized interest  and certain indirect costs 
a portion of real estate inventory and estimates for costs to complete are allocated to each unit based on the relative sales value of each unit as compared to the estimated sales value of the total project 
these estimates are reevaluated at least annually  with any adjustments being allocated prospectively to the remaining units available for sale 
the accounting estimate related to inventory valuation is susceptible to change due to the use of assumptions about future sales proceeds and related real estate expenditures 
management s assumptions about future housing and home site sales prices  sales volume and sales velocity require significant judgment because the real estate market is cyclical and highly sensitive to changes in economic conditions 
in addition  actual results could differ from management s estimates due to changes in anticipated development  construction and overhead costs 
although we have not made significant adjustments affecting real estate gross profit margins in the past  there can be no assurances that estimates used to generate future real estate gross profit margins will not differ from our current estimates 
revenue recognition percentage of completion 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for sales of real estate  revenue for multi family residences under construction is recognized on the percentage of completion method when construction is beyond a preliminary stage  the buyer is committed to the extent of being unable to require a refund except for nondelivery of the unit  sufficient units have already been sold to assure that the entire property will not revert to rental property  sales price is assured  and aggregate sales proceeds and costs can be reasonably estimated 
revenue is recognized in proportion to the percentage of total costs incurred in relation to estimated total costs 
impairment of long lived assets and goodwill 
our long lived assets  primarily real estate held for investment  are carried at cost unless circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate such an evaluation is warranted 
this review involves a number of assumptions and estimates used in determining whether impairment exists  including estimation of undiscounted cash flows 
depending on the asset  we use varying methods to determine fair value  such as i discounting of expected future cash flows  ii determining resale values by market  or iii applying a capitalization rate to net operating income using prevailing rates in a given market 
these methods of determining fair value can fluctuate up or down significantly as a result of a number of factors  including changes in the general economy of our markets and demand for real estate 
if we determine that impairment exists due to the inability to recover an asset s carrying value  a provision for loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value 
goodwill is carried at the lower of cost or fair value and is tested for impairment at least annually  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate such an evaluation is warranted  by comparing the carrying amount of the net assets of each reporting unit with goodwill to the fair value of the reporting unit taken as a whole 
the impairment review involves a number of assumptions and estimates including estimating discounted future cash flows  net operating income  future economic conditions  fair value of assets held and discount rates 
if this comparison indicates that the goodwill of a particular reporting unit is impaired  the aggregate of the fair value of each of the individual assets and liabilities of the reporting unit are compared to the fair value of the reporting unit to determine the amount of goodwill impairment  if any 
intangibles 
we allocate the purchase price of acquired properties to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired based on their respective fair values  using customary estimates of fair value  including data from appraisals  comparable sales  discounted cash flow analysis and other methods 
these fair values can fluctuate up or down significantly as a result of a number of factors and estimates  including changes in the general economy of our markets  demand for real estate  and fair market values assigned to leases as well as fair value assigned to customer relationships 
pension plan 
the company sponsors a defined benefit pension plan covering a majority of our employees 
currently  our pension plan is over funded and contributes income to the company 
the accounting for pension benefits is determined by standardized accounting and actuarial methods using numerous estimates  including discount rates  expected long term investment returns on plan assets  employee turnover  mortality and retirement ages  and future salary increases 
changes in these key assumptions can have a significant impact on the income contributed by the pension plan 
we engage the services of an independent actuary and investment consultant to assist us in determining these assumptions and in the calculation of pension income 
for example  in  a increase in the assumed long term rate of return on pension assets would have resulted in a million increase in pre tax income million net of tax 
a decrease in the assumed long term rate of return would have caused an equivalent decrease in income 
a increase in the assumed discount rate on pension obligations would have resulted in a million decrease in pre tax income million net of tax 
a decrease in the assumed discount rate would have resulted in a million increase in pre tax income million net of tax 
income taxes 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements  significant management judgment is required to estimate our income taxes 
our estimates are based on our interpretation of federal and state tax laws 
we estimate our actual current tax due and assess temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
the temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
adjustments may be required by a change in assessment of our deferred tax assets and liabilities  changes due to audit adjustments by federal and state tax authorities  and changes in tax laws 
to the extent adjustments are required in any given period we would include the adjustments in the tax provision in the statement of operations and or balance sheet 
these adjustments could materially impact our financial position and results of operation 
results of operations net income for was million  or per diluted share  compared with million  or per diluted share  in and million  or per diluted share  in the results for included a non cash asset impairment charge  net of tax  relating to advantis  our commercial real estate services unit  of million  or per diluted share 
the results for included a net gain on the sale of arvida realty services ars  our former residential real estate services segment  of million  or per diluted share  and a gain on the forward sale of securities of million  or per diluted share 
results for included earnings from the discontinued operations of ars of million  or per diluted share and million  or per diluted share in we report revenues from our four operating segments community development  commercial real estate development and services  land sales  and forestry 
real estate sales are generated from sales of housing units and developed home sites in our community development segment  developed and undeveloped land and in service buildings in our commercial real estate development and services segment  parcels of undeveloped land and developed rural sites in our land sales segment and occasionally sales of bulk land from our forestry segment 
realty revenues  consisting of property and asset management fees  construction management fees  and lease and sales commissions  are generated from the commercial real estate development and services segment 
timber sales are generated from the forestry segment 
rental revenue is generated primarily from lease income related to our portfolio of investment and development properties as a component of the commercial real estate development and services segment 
other revenues are primarily club operations and management fees from the community development segment and development fees from the commercial real estate development and services segment

the increase in cost of realty revenues was due to increases in the costs of brokerage  property management  and construction revenues

management does not expect the over funded position of the pension plan to continue to decline 
we do not expect to have to fund the pension plan in the foreseeable future  unless market conditions deteriorate significantly 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased million  or  to million in  compared to million in the increase was due to a million increase in depreciation resulting primarily from additional investments in commercial and residential operating property and property  plant and equipment and a million increase in amortization primarily resulting from an increase in intangible assets 
depreciation and amortization increased million  or  to million in  compared to million in the increase was due to a million increase in depreciation resulting primarily from expenditures for commercial and residential operating property and property  plant and equipment

 goodwill and other intangible assets fas  which resulted in the cessation of goodwill amortization as of january  goodwill amortization was million in  excluding million included in discontinued operations

other income expense 
other income expense was million in  million in and million in other income expense was made up of investment income  interest expense  gains on sales and dispositions of assets and other income and  in and  gains and losses on the valuation and settlement of forward sale contracts 
in october  we entered into a forward sale transaction with a major financial institution that  in effect  provided for the monetization of our long held portfolio of equity investments which  at december   had a cost of approximately million and a fair value of approximately million 
under the forward sale agreement  we received approximately million in cash and were required to settle the forward transaction by october   by delivering either the securities or the equivalent value of the securities in cash to the financial institution 
the agreement permitted us to retain that amount of the securities representing appreciation up to of their value on october  should the value of the securities increase 
the securities were recorded at fair value on the balance sheet and the related unrealized gain  net of tax  was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income 
at the time of entering into the forward sale contracts  we recorded a liability in long term debt for approximately million  subject to increase as interest expense was imputed at an annual rate of 
the liability was also subject to increase by the amount  if any  that the fair value of the securities increased beyond the retained 
on february  and october   in two separate transactions  we settled our forward sale contracts by delivering equity securities to the financial institution for an aggregate pre tax gain of million 
the liability related to the contracts settled in february was million at the time of settlement and the resulting gain recognized in the first quarter of was million pre tax 
the liability related to the contracts settled in october was million at the time of settlement and the resulting gain recognized in the fourth quarter of was approximately million pre tax 
investment income decreased to million in from million in  primarily due to lower dividend income resulting from the disposition of securities 
interest expense decreased million to million in compared to million in  due to the settlement of the debt related to the forward sale contracts  which was partially offset by interest expense attributable to medium term notes we issued in  and interest attributable to debt secured by commercial buildings

equity in loss income of unconsolidated affiliates totaled million in  million in and million in the community development segment s unconsolidated affiliates include our limited partnership interest in arvida jmb partners  lp arvida jmb 
arvida jmb completed its operations in and is currently winding up its affairs 
as a result  the contribution to pre tax income from arvida jmb substantially ended at the end of arvida jmb has finalized its current estimates of future costs and future cash distributions associated with the completion of operations  and  as a result  we adjusted our investment in the partnership by a million pre tax charge in arvida jmb s contribution to equity in loss income of unconsolidated affiliates was million in and million in based on current expectations  we do not anticipate any material future income or losses from our investment in arvida jmb

item a 
market risk our primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk related to our long term debt 
as of december   million was outstanding under our million credit facility  which matures on march  this debt accrues interest at different rates based on timing of the loan and our preferences  but generally will be either the one  two  three or six month london interbank offered rate libor plus a libor margin in effect at the time of the loan 
this loan potentially subjects us to interest rate risk relating to the change in the libor rates 
we manage our interest rate exposure by monitoring the effects of market changes in interest rates 
if libor had been basis points higher or lower  the effect on net income with respect to interest expense on the million credit facility would have been a respective decrease or increase in the amount of million pre tax million net of tax
