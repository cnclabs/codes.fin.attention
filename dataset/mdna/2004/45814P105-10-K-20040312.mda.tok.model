for a more complete understanding of trends  events  commitments  uncertainties  liquidity  capital resources  and critical accounting estimates  you should carefully read this entire document 
these have an impact on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
summary results  goals  and objectives net income was million  million  and million and diluted earnings per diluted common share was   and for the years ended december     respectively 
the diminished performance in was primarily the result an unsuccessful leverage strategy implemented in and an asset sensitive balance sheet while interest rates fell through and the first half of returns on average assets were   and and returns on average equity were   and for the years ended   and  respectively 
management has set a number of goals intended to facilitate the company s transition from a decentralized group of community banks to a growth company 
first  the company wants to drive earnings through focused sales and service initiatives 
successful execution of this goal would lead to growth in key elements of the balance sheet 
second  the company wants to extend the improvements of its credit risk management culture 
successful execution of this goal would include additional credit quality improvements throughout the year 
finally  integra wants to enhance its financial management capabilities and use those capabilities to improve results and more effectively manage risk 
successful execution of this goal would lead to stabilization and improvement in net interest income  net interest margin trends and acceptable levels of interest rate and liquidity risk 
on the first goal  new sales and service initiatives led to growth in consumer and mortgage loans and  to a lesser extent  commercial lending 
management believes that  over the long term  the company should work toward an equal balance between commercial and retail lending 
commercial loans represented of total loans at the end of  down from overall loan balance growth averaged in  primarily in the consumer and mortgage lending  with the average balances for consumer loans growing by and mortgage loans by 
commercial loans grew by  on average  in on the deposit side of the balance sheet  the company s sales efforts were focused on growing demand deposit  money market and savings account balances valuable core deposits 
valuable core deposit average balances grew  or million during with stronger growth trends observed in the second half of the year 
valuable core deposits grew million  or  in when comparing the average balance of the fourth quarter of with the fourth quarter of integra s second goal was to extend the credit quality improvements achieved in credit quality remained satisfactory during the year 
non performing assets fell by million to million and the ratio of non performing loans to total loans fell by basis points to 
net charge offs for were basis points  in line with management s expectations for the year 
the ratio of allowance for loan losses to total loans was basis points at year end the third goal was to enhance and effectively use the company s financial management capabilities 
a new chief financial officer was hired in late and a new treasurer  a new controller  a new quantitative risk manager and a new strategic initiatives manager were added in this new team contributed significantly to the improvement in net interest income and the net interest margin 
the net interest margin in the fourth quarter of was basis points higher than the net interest margin for the same quarter of the stability in net interest margin experienced during the year was attributable in part to several restructuring transactions during that were implemented on an opportunistic basis  building on similar efforts in first  the investment portfolio was restructured to reduce the concentration of high premium  long term  fixed rate mortgage backed securities 
sales proceeds from these securities were reinvested in low premium or discount  shorter term  collateralized mortgage obligations cmos or to year hybrid adjustable rate mortgages arms 
second  in june  the company called million of fixed rate trust preferred securities  using the proceeds of a new million issue of floating rate trust preferred securities 
finally  the company prepaid million in fixed rate high coupon federal home loan bank fhlb advances 
management believes there are further opportunities for restructuring of the balance sheet  primarily centered on the million in fhlb advances which have an average coupon rate of 
these advances are described in more detail in the long term borrowings section of this analysis and the notes to financial statements 
management is weighing three basic alternative courses of action 
first  the company can let the fhlb advances mature as scheduled from through this strategy would preserve capital  but limit further improvement in the net interest margin 
second  the company can continue to reduce the fhlb advances on an opportunistic basis 
as was seen in and  this strategy balances the incremental impact on capital while potentially improving the net interest margin on an incremental basis 
third  the company can prepay a significant portion or all of the fhlb advances 
this strategy would likely result in a significant prepayment charge  reducing capital in the short term  but greatly enhance the potential for earnings improvement 
based on estimates from fhlb  management estimates the pre tax impact of prepaying all of the fhlb advances as of december  at approximately million 
management will evaluate these alternatives against their impact on current and future capital levels  the ability of such a transaction to further contain interest rate risk  improve the company s liquidity  enhance future earnings  and other considerations 
integra reaffirmed its policy of providing an attractive dividend for shareholders in the dividend yield was in a range between to percent for most of the year 
integra s divided payout ratio was percent in other objectives the company continually evaluates and refines its retail distribution network 
one of the company s objectives is to reach an approximately equal balance between banking centers located in community and metropolitan markets over the next to years 
the company currently has approximately percent of its banking centers located in community markets 
integra initiated plans to build four new banking centers in in metropolitan markets 
additionally  in may  integra sold its owingsville  kentucky banking center with approximately million in loans and million in deposits for a gain of approximately million 
in the second half of  the company extended its commercial lending activities by adding an experienced team of commercial lenders with a focus on commercial real estate 
the team had a past working relationship with several members of the company s executive team at another financial institution in the area 
offices were opened in metro cincinnati and cleveland  ohio and louisville  kentucky 
the team s emphasis will be on loans to borrowers with stronger credit ratings than the company s current average commercial real estate borrower 
by year end this group had originated approximately million in loans 
most of these loans are located within the areas they serve 
subject to limits  loans may be occasionally made on projects outside the markets the company serves to borrowers located within the company s broader market area 
the company will also continue to look at opportunities to further optimize their banking center network and loan portfolios 
this strategy may involve selling or purchasing  banking centers  loan portfolios  or specific lines of business 
financial overview net income for was million compared to million for the same period in the company generated successive quarterly improvements in net income throughout lower net interest income  greater loan loss provision expense  and lower non interest income offset lower non interest and tax expense 
specifically  net interest income was million lower million lower on a tax equivalent basis 
there was an additional million provision for loan loss expense and non interest income was million lower while non interest expense was million lower and income tax expense declined million 
net interest income nii  on a tax equivalent basis te  was million in compared with million in though both average loan and deposit balances were higher in  net interest income was lower in part  due to the effect of the company s asset sensitive interest rate risk position 
though reduced early in  the asset sensitive interest rate risk position was in place in as interest rates fell to basis points 
the full effect of this lower interest rate environment was felt throughout net interest income trends were favorable through as nii grew in of the quarters in  and was unchanged in the other quarter 
compared to the fourth quarter of  net interest income te grew percent  or million 
the net interest margin te improved by basis points  from to  despite lower interest rates for much of the improvement resulted from balance sheet growth  more disciplined pricing and a more balanced interest rate risk posture 
non interest income was million in compared with million in a decline of million 
this was primarily the result of a million decrease in securities gains from million in to million in  partially offset by the million gain recognized from the banking center sale 
for additional detail  see table on page the remaining components of non interest income were approximately million greater in than  with the majority of the improvement attributable to mortgage related revenue  higher deposit and other service revenue and insurance commissions

personnel related expenses were million higher in than  making up most of the increase 
of the increase in personnel related expenses  performance based incentives and higher benefits costs primarily health care costs made up approximately of the increase 
overall  salary expenses were million in compared with million in  representing a increase 
part of the increase in salary expense in is attributable to insourcing the company s internal audit and loan review functions 
net income for was million compared to million earned in earnings in were negatively impacted by the million writedown of loan values in prior to a loan sale in specifically  at december   million of identified loans were written down by million to the lower of cost or market value prior to being reclassified from the loan portfolio into loans held for sale 
during  the company sold approximately million of the loans held for sale and transferred million of performing loans back into the loan portfolio  as the company no longer had the intent to sell these loans 
the company completed the loan sale during net interest income decreased by million  or  in the decrease in net interest income was precipitated by a million decline in average earning assets and an asset sensitive interest rate risk position  partially offset with a more favorable mix of loan and deposit products 
the provision for loan losses decreased million to million in non interest income was million in compared with million in  which included million and million of securities gains in and  respectively 
non interest expenses increased million in  which included debt prepayment fees of million and loans held for sale expenses of million 
earnings per share  on a diluted basis were for compared to in and in returns on average assets and equity for were and  respectively  compared with and in effective january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
in accordance with the transition provisions of sfas no 
 the company recorded a cumulative effect type transaction loss  net of tax  of million  or 
per diluted share  to recognize the excess of carrying value over the market value of all interest rate caps 
the company began a leverage program in in which medium and long term mortgage backed securities and agency and trust preferred securities were acquired with long term federal home loan bank advances and long term national market repurchase agreements 
during  the company terminated the leverage program  reducing its dependency on non core funding sources and taking other steps to reduce its sensitivity to changes in interest rates 
these steps included selling fixed rate  longer maturity  mortgage backed securities and reinvesting the proceeds in shorter maturity securities with a more stable and predictable cash flow 
gains from securities sales were used to cover the costs associated with prepaying million in long term debt and expenses incurred from the loan sale in and an additional million in critical accounting policies the accounting and reporting policies of the company conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and general practices within the financial services industry 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates  assumptions  and judgements are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements  accordingly  as this information changes  the financial statements could reflect different estimates  assumptions  and judgements 
certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates  assumptions  and judgements and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
the company considers its critical accounting policies to include the following allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents management s best estimate of probable losses inherent in the existing loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is increased by the provision for losses  and reduced by loans charged off  net of recoveries 
the provision for loan losses is determined based on management s assessment of several factors actual loss experience  changes in composition of the loan portfolio  evaluation of specific borrowers and collateral  current economic conditions  trends in past due and non accrual loan balances  and the results of recent regulatory examinations 
loans are considered impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable the company will not be able to collect all amounts due in accordance with the contractual terms 
the measurement of impaired loans is generally based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the historical effective interest rate stipulated in the loan agreement  except that all collateral dependent loans are measured for impairment based on the market value of the collateral  less estimated cost to liquidate 
in measuring the market value of the collateral  management uses assumptions and methodologies consistent with those that would be utilized by unrelated third parties 
changes in the financial condition of individual borrowers  in economic conditions  in historical loss experience and in the conditions of the various markets in which the collateral may be liquidated may all affect the required level of the allowance for loan losses and the associated provision for loan losses 
estimation of market value the estimation of market value is significant to several of the company s assets  including loans held for sale  investment securities available for sale  mortgage servicing rights  other real estate owned  as well as market values associated with derivative financial instruments and goodwill and other intangibles 
these are all recorded at either market value or the lower of cost or market value 
market values are determined based on third party sources  when available 
furthermore  accounting principles generally accepted in the united states require disclosure of the market value of financial instruments as a part of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
market values are volatile and may be influenced by a number of factors  including market interest rates  prepayment speeds  discount rates and the shape of yield curves 
market values for securities available for sale are based on quoted market prices 
if a quoted market price is not available  market values are estimated using quoted market prices for similar securities 
the market values for loans held for sale are based upon quoted market values while the market values of mortgage servicing rights are based on discounted cash flow analysis utilizing dealer consensus prepayment speeds and market discount rates 
the market values of other real estate owned are typically determined based on appraisals by third parties  less estimated costs to sell 
the market values of derivative financial instruments are estimated based on current market quotes 
goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired 
the company assesses goodwill for impairment annually on a segment level by applying a fair value based test using net present value of estimated net cash flows 
impairment exists when the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
other intangible assets represent purchased assets that also lack physical substance but can be distinguished from goodwill because of contractual or other legal rights or because the asset is capable of being sold or exchanged either on its own or in combination with an asset or liability 
on january   the company adopted sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
under the provisions of sfas  goodwill is no longer ratably amortized into the income statement over an estimated life  but rather is tested at least annually for impairment 
intangible assets which have finite lives continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives and also continue to be subject to impairment testing 
all other intangible assets have finite lives and are amortized on a straight line basis over varying periods not exceeding years 
note of the notes to consolidated financial statements includes a summary of goodwill and other intangible assets 
net interest income net interest income is the difference between interest income on earning assets  such as loans and investments  and interest expense paid on liabilities such as deposits and borrowings 
net interest income is affected by the general level of interest rates  changes in interest rates  and by changes in the amount and composition of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
changes in net interest income for the last two years are presented in the following schedule 
the change in net interest income not solely due to changes in volume or rates has been allocated in proportion to the absolute dollar amounts of the change in each 
in addition to this schedule  at the end of management s discussion and analysis  there is a three year balance sheet analysis on an average basis and an analysis of net interest income 
changes in net interest income interest on a federal tax equivalent basis compared to compared to change due to change due to increase decrease a change in a change in total total interest income volume rate change volume rate change loans       securities      loans held for sale     other short term investments     total interest income       interest expense deposits      short term borrowings      long term borrowings      total interest expense       net interest income       the following discussion of results of operations is on a tax equivalent basis 
tax exempt income  such as interest on loans and securities of state and political subdivisions  has been increased to an amount that would have been earned had such income been taxable 
net interest income was million or lower in than in the decrease was primarily due to an asset sensitive balance sheet for most of in a lower rate environment 
pricing discipline on both loan and deposits was stressed and monitored in the securities portfolio was restructured and and year fixed rate high premium mortgaged backed securities were replaced primarily with two to three year duration low premium or discount collateralized mortgage obligations with significant prepayment protection of the cashflow and to year hybrid arms 
in  net interest income was million  million or less than that earned in earning assets averaged  million in compared to  million in average interest bearing liabilities were  million and  million in and  respectively 
the net interest margin for the twelve months ended december  was compared to for the same period one year prior 
the lower net interest income in was the result of the decline in average earning assets partially offset by the eleven basis point improvement in net interest margin 
though the balance sheet remained asset sensitive in  the margin improvement resulted from a higher proportion of higher spread loans and fewer time deposits in than during and  the federal reserve lowered the targeted federal funds interest rates and basis points  respectively 
the significant drop in rates over the past two years increased prepayments in both the mortgage backed investment securities and fixed rate loan portfolios  including a significant impact on residential mortgages 
when prepaid  these funds were generally reinvested at lower rates 
average earning assets increased million during to  million 
the company made a decision to hold fewer short term investments in  finding other alternatives to provide liquidity 
average federal funds sold and other short term investments decreased million compared to average loans held for sale decreased million  in due primarily to the loan sale conducted during during average loans increased million  or  and average investment securities increased million  or 
the mix of earning assets shows average loans to average earning assets increased from in to in average loans increased million  or  during  compared to a decrease of million  or  during most of the increase occurred in integra s consumer and mortgage loan portfolios 
loan income decreased in as a result of a basis point decline in loan yields 
loan income decreased in as a result of a basis point decline in loan yields accompanied with a decrease in average balances 
the average yield on loans was in versus in average investment securities increased million or in partially offsetting the reduction in short term investments 
the yield on securities declined from in to in security income decreased in as a result of a basis point decline in security yields partially offset by the increase in average balances 
overall  average deposit balances rose by million  or  in this reflects a million increase in valuable core deposits  partially offset by a million reduction in time deposits 
during the current low interest rate environment  customer preferences have shifted to shorter term  liquid deposit products and to deposit alternatives  including annuities 
during  average short term borrowings increased million and average long term borrowings decreased million 
the decrease in long term borrowings was primarily due to the prepayment of long term  higher rate debt 
non interest income non interest income totaled million for the twelve months ended december  compared to million for and million for adjusted non interest income totaled million in  million in and million in adjusted non interest income continues to be an increasingly significant portion of revenue for the company and has grown to represent of net federal tax equivalent revenues in as compared to in and in the table below illustrates several non interest income items incurred outside the traditional core bank operations and reconciles non interest income and adjusted non interest income 
management feels excluding these items presents a clearer picture of its core operating non interest income 
in thousands  non interest income as reported    less gain on banking center sale  less securities gains    adjusted non interest income    service charges on deposit accounts increased million  or  in growth in these fees resulted from new fee sources  including an enhanced overdraft protection service  greater product and service usage and improved efforts to collect a greater percentage of assessed fees 
service charge income totaled million in  million in  and million in other service charges and fees increased million from million in to million in card related fees totaled million in compared to million in and million in due to increased sales efforts of debit cards and the increasing preference of these cards over checks 
as a result of the national mastercard visa settlement with wal mart stores inc  debit card interchange fees decreased in the second half of the company is making an effort to increase the number of debit cards outstanding and the number of customer transactions 
a successful campaign would lessen the impact on future debit card revenue 
mortgage servicing income in was million compared to million in due to the continuing high demand for new and refinanced residential mortgages 
the company sold the majority of its current year s fixed rate mortgage loan production to generate fee income and reduce interest rate exposure 
the company continues to service most of these loans 
at december   the company was servicing million of sold residential mortgage loans compared to million at december  management anticipates a slower mortgage origination environment in due to a higher interest rate environment as compared to the company has implemented programs with wholesale mortgage brokers and lendingtree as new sources of mortgage production 
these loans or customers are in the company s lending area 
arm loans originated through the wholesale brokers are retained in the company s portfolio and fixed rate mortgages are sold servicing retained 
the lendingtree mortgages are expected to be sold within days with servicing released

non interest expense non interest expense for totaled million  a decrease of million  or compared to the prior year 
adjusted non interest expense was million for  or higher than the table below illustrates several expenses incurred outside the traditional core bank operations and reconciles non interest expense and adjusted non interest expense 
management feels excluding these items presents a clearer picture of its core operating expense 
in thousands  non interest expense as reported    less debt prepayment expenses   less loan held for sale expense  less low income housing project losses  less accelerated trust preferred amortization  adjusted non interest expense    salaries and employee benefits accounted for of non interest expense in compared to in and in salaries and employee benefits totaled million in compared to million in the increase was attributable to three items salaries increased million  or  medical insurance increased million  and commissions and incentives increased million 
part of the increase in salary expense in is attributable to insourcing the company s internal audit and loan review functions 
the company has reviewed the costs of medical insurance and has begun offering an alternative choice to employees that incents employees to more actively manage their health care consumption and could help control the increase in these expenses in the future 
the commissions and incentives increases in and were mainly due to the increase in performance based awards tied to loan originations and sales of fee based services and deposit products

the company incurred debt prepayment expenses of million in and million in as a result of prepaying million in long term fhlb advances and million in term repurchase agreements in and  respectively 
the company restructured a portion of its balance sheet each year by selling certain mortgaged backed investment securities  using the proceeds to retire the debt and reinvest in shorter maturity securities with more predictable cash flows 
the company recorded expenses of million in and no comparable expense for related to the loan sale project 
the writedown in was precipitated primarily by the rapid deterioration in one commercial loan and lower than anticipated prices were realized on the remaining loans held for sale 
the loan sale project was completed in amortization of intangible assets was million in compared to million and million in and  respectively 
the decrease in  resulted from the company adopting sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill and certain other intangible assets having indefinite lives are no longer amortized to earnings  but rather are subject to testing for impairment 
the company completed this testing in and found no impairment 
the purchase of webster bancorp  inc in january and the full year effect of the banking center purchase completed in november accounted for the increase in during the fourth quarter of  the company adopted sfas no 
 acquisitions of certain financial institutions  and  as required  reversed approximately million of pre tax amortization expense incurred during the first nine months of other non interest expenses were million in  increasing million  or  from the prior year 
pre tax operating losses related to the company s investment in low income housing projects lihp increased million in this increase is mainly attributable to the lihp entered into in late expenses related to trust preferred amortization also increased million  caused mainly from the redemption of million of fixed rate trust preferred securities in the second quarter of upon adoption of fas  accounting for derivatives instruments and hedging activities  on january   the company recorded a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of million  net of tax

in late  the company invested in a lihp which generated million more tax credits in than in these credits are a direct offset to tax expense and a large component of lowering the tax expense in and the tax benefit was primarily the result of lower taxable income as a result of the additional provision for loan losses recorded in the fourth quarter 
income from tax exempt or tax preferred sources  including bank owned life insurance  low income housing projects and dividends on tax preferred securities  including municipals and tax preferred agencies  increased in compared to one year prior

securities increased million to  million at december  from one year prior 
the portfolio has continued to shift toward investments in year low premium or discount cmos and to year hybrid arms and out of high premium and year fixed rate passthrough mortgage backed securities 
inherent in mortgage backed securities is prepayment risk  which occurs when borrowers prepay their obligations due to market fluctuations and rates 
prepayment rates generally can be expected to increase during periods of lower interest rates as underlying mortgages are refinanced at lower rates  which occurred in and mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations represented of the investment portfolio at december  as compared to and at december  and  respectively 
management repositioned a portion of the portfolio late in and early in order to reduce the exposure to accelerating prepayments and unanticipated premium write downs going forward 
the company s present investment strategy focuses on shorter duration securities with more predictable cash flows in a variety of interest rate scenarios

in the second half of  the company expanded its commercial lending activities by adding a team of commercial lenders with a particular focus on commercial real estate 
the team had a past working relationship with several members of the company s executive team at another financial institution in the area 
offices were opened in metro cincinnati and cleveland  ohio and louisville  kentucky 
by year end this group had originated approximately million in loans 
most of these loans are located within the areas they serve 
loans are occasionally made on projects outside the markets the company serves to borrowers located within the company s defined lending area 
residential mortgage loans grew million  or to million at december  compared to million at the same time in home equity loans increased to million at december  an increase of million as homeowners refinanced in the low rate environment 
home equity loans are generally lines of credit collateralized by a mortgage on the customer s primary residence

as of december   the company identified million of performing and non performing loans which it intended to sell 
this portfolio consisted of million of commercial loans  million of residential mortgage loans and million of consumer loans 
the loans identified for sales in were written down to market value  resulting in charge offs totaling million  prior to being reclassified from the loan portfolio into loans held for sale 
during  the company sold approximately million of the loans held for sale and transferred million of performing loans back into the loan portfolio  as the company no longer had the intent to sell these loans 
in addition  during the same period the company wrote down the held for sale portfolio by a total of million 
this additional writedown was necessitated due to the rapid deterioration of a significant commercial credit in the portfolio  lower realization on the loans sold and lower estimated realization on the remaining loans held for sale 
net activity  including payments and disbursements  on these loans totaled million in the loan sale was completed in loan portfolio at year end in thousands commercial  industrial and agricultural loans      economic development loans and other obligations of state and political subdivisions      lease financing      commercial real estate   construction and development   real estate loans    residential mortgages   home equity   consumer loans      total loans      less unearned income loans  net of unearned income      in  the company changed its methodology for classifying the types of loans in its portfolio 
the principal effect of this change was to reduce the number of loans reported prior to as real estate or real estate mortgage loans 
the company determined that it was not practical to apply the new methodology to earlier years 
as a result  information for years prior to is shown as previously reported and is not comparable to the information for and comparable amounts that would be included in the real estate loans line for and would be  and  respectively 
different types of loans are subject to varying levels of risk 
management mitigates this risk through portfolio diversification as well as geographic diversification 
the company concentrates its lending activity in the geographic market areas that it serves  primarily indiana  illinois  kentucky and ohio 
the loan portfolio is also diversified by type of loan and industry 
the company lends to customers in various industries including real estate  agricultural  health and other related services  and manufacturing 
there is no concentration of loans in any single industry exceeding of the portfolio nor does the portfolio contain any loans to finance speculative transactions or loans to foreign entities

nonaccrual loans are loans on which interest recognition has been suspended because of doubts as to the borrower s ability to repay principal or interest according to the terms of the contract 
loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status after becoming days past due if the ultimate collectability of the loan is in question 
loans which are current  but as to which serious doubt exists about repayment ability  may also be placed on nonaccrual status 
restructured loans are loans for which the terms have been renegotiated to provide a reduction or deferral of principal or interest because of the borrower s financial position 
loans days or more past due are loans that are continuing to accrue interest  but which are contractually past due days or more as to interest or principal payments 
other real estate owned represents properties obtained for debts previously contracted 
management is not aware of any loans which have not been disclosed as non performing assets that represent or result from unfavorable trends or uncertainties which management reasonably believes will materially adversely affect future operating results  liquidity or capital resources  or represent material credits as to which management has serious doubt as to the ability of such borrower to comply with loan repayment terms 
included in the non performing assets is a defaulted utility bond anticipation note issue  with a face value of million 
the refinancing of these securities was delayed pending resolution of an appeal by rate payers of the rate increases necessary to support the refinancing 
on january   the indiana supreme court denied the petition to transfer  effectively settling the rate case 
it is our expectation that the securities can now be refinanced

the improvement in the non performing loan to total loan ratio is due to aggressive management of non performing loans 
the interest recognized on nonaccrual loans was approximately thousand  thousand and thousand  in  and  respectively 
the amount of interest that would have been earned had these nonaccrual loans remained in accruing status was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the company monitors watch list assets 
for the most part  assets are designated as watch list to ensure more frequent monitoring 
the assets are reviewed to insure proper earning status and security perfection 
if it is determined that there is serious doubt as to performance in accordance with the original terms of the contract then the loan is placed on nonaccrual 
these loans are reviewed on an ongoing basis 
credit management the company s credit management procedures include board oversight of the lending function by the board s credit and risk management committee  which meets at least quarterly 
the committee monitors credit quality through its review of information such as delinquencies  non performing loans and assets  problem and watch list loans and charge offs 
the lending policies address risks associated with each type of lending  including collateralization  loan to value ratios  loan concentrations  insider lending and other pertinent matters and are regularly reviewed to ensure that they remain appropriate for the current lending environment 
in addition  a sample of loans is reviewed by an independent loan review department  compliance as well as regulatory agencies 
consumer  mortgage and small business loans are centrally underwritten and approved while commercial loans are approved through a combination of low individual lending authorities  independent senior credit officers and an executive loan committee 
the executive loan committee approves or ratifies all loans in excess of million 
the allowance for loan losses is that amount which  in management s opinion  is adequate to absorb probable inherent loan losses as determined by management s ongoing evaluation of the loan portfolio 
the evaluation by management is based upon consideration of various factors including growth of the portfolio  an analysis of individual credits  adverse situations that could affect a borrower s ability to repay  prior and current loss experience  the results of recent regulatory examinations and economic conditions 
loans that are deemed to be uncollectible are charged to the allowance  while recoveries of previously charged off amounts are credited to the allowance 
the provision for loan losses is the amount charged to operations to provide assurance that the allowance for loan losses is sufficient to absorb probable losses 
the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is based on ongoing quarterly assessments of the probable losses inherent in the credit portfolios 
the methodology for assessing the adequacy of the allowance establishes both an allocated and unallocated component 
the allocated component of the allowance for commercial loans is based on a review of specific loans as well as delinquency  classification levels and historic charge offs for pools of non reviewed loans 
for consumer loans  the allocated component is based on loan payment status and historical loss rates 
a review of selected loans based on risk rating and size is conducted to identify loans with heightened risk or probable losses 
the primary responsibility for this review rests with management assigned accountability for the credit relationship 
this review is supplemented with reviews by the credit review function and regulatory agencies 
these reviews provide information which assist in the timely identification of problems and potential problems and in deciding whether the credit represents a probable loss or risk which should be recognized 
where appropriate  an allocation is made to the allowance for individual loans based on management s estimate of the borrower s ability to repay the loan given the availability of collateral  other sources of cash flow and legal options available to the company 
included in the review of individual loans are those that are impaired as provided in sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
loans are considered impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable the company will not be able to collect all amounts due in accordance with the contractual terms 
the allowance established for impaired loans is generally based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the historical effective interest rate stipulated in the loan agreement  except that all collateral dependent loans are measured for impairment based on the market value of the collateral  less estimated cost to liquidate 
homogeneous pools of loans  such as consumer installment and residential real estate loans  are not individually reviewed 
an allowance is established for each pool of loans based upon historical loss ratios  based on the net charge off history by loan category 
in addition  the allowance reflects other risks affecting the loan portfolio  such as economic conditions in the company s geographic areas  specific industry financial conditions and other factors 
the unallocated portion of the allowance covers general economic uncertainties as well as the imprecision inherent in any loan and lease loss forecasting methodology 
it will vary over time depending on economic  industry  organization and portfolio conditions 
the factors used to evaluate homogenous loans in accordance with the sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies are reviewed at least quarterly and are updated as conditions warrant  resulting in improved allocation of specific reserves 
the provision for loan losses is the amount necessary to adjust the allowance for loan losses to an amount that is adequate to absorb estimated loan losses as determined by management s periodic evaluations of the loan portfolio 
this evaluation by management is based upon consideration of actual loss experience  changes in composition of the loan portfolio  evaluation of specific borrowers and collateral  current economic conditions  trends in past due and non accrual loan balances and the results of recent regulatory examinations 
the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is reviewed on a quarterly basis and presented to the audit committee of the board of directors for approval 
the accounting policies related to the allowance for loan losses are significant policies that involve the use of estimates and a high degree of subjectivity 
management believes that they have developed appropriate policies and procedures for assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses that reflect the assessment of credit risk after careful consideration of known relevant facts 
in developing this assessment  management must rely on estimates and exercise judgement regarding matters where the ultimate outcome is unknown such as economic factors  developments affecting companies in specific industries or issues with respect to single borrowers 
depending on changes in circumstances  future assessments of credit risk may yield different results  which may require an increase or decrease in the allowance for loan losses 
the company continues to invest in its loan portfolio monitoring system to enhance its risk management capabilities

the company opened two new banking centers in early and has plans to open one each in the second and fourth quarters of the two planned banking centers are estimated to cost between million to million  in total 
the florence banking center will also serve as a regional office for the cincinnati metro area 
the company and the banking industry are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can elicit certain mandatory actions by regulators that  if undertaken  could have a direct material effect on the company s financial statements 
capital adequacy in the banking industry is evaluated primarily by the use of ratios that measure capital against assets and certain off balance sheet items 
certain ratios weight these assets based on risk characteristics according to regulatory accounting practices 
at december   the company and integra bank exceeded the regulatory minimums and integra bank met the regulatory definition of well capitalized 
the capital securities held by the trusts currently qualify as tier capital for the company under federal reserve board guidelines 
as a result of the issuance of fin  the federal reserve board is currently evaluating whether deconsolidation of the trusts will affect the qualification of the capital securities as tier capital 
liquidity liquidity of a banking institution reflects the ability to provide funds to meet loan requests  to accommodate possible outflows in deposits and other borrowings  and to take advantage of interest rate market opportunities 
funding loan requests  providing for deposit out flows  and managing interest rate fluctuations require monitoring and continuous analysis in order to match maturities of specific categories of short term and long term loans and investments with specific types of deposits and borrowings 
bank liquidity is normally considered in terms of the nature of mix of the banking institution s sources and uses of funds 
for the bank  the primary sources of short term asset liquidity have been federal funds sold  commercial paper  interest bearing deposits with other financial institutions  and securities available for sale 
in addition to these sources  short term asset liquidity is provided by scheduled principal paydowns and maturing loans and securities 
the balance between these sources and needs to fund loan demand and deposit withdrawals is monitored under the company s asset liability management program 
when these sources are not adequate  the company may use fed fund purchases  brokered deposits  repurchase agreements  sale of investment securities or utilize its borrowing capacity with fhlb indianapolis  as alternative sources of liquidity 
additionally  the company s underwriting standards for its mortgage loan portfolio comply with standards established by government housing agencies  as a result  a portion of the mortgage loan portfolio could be sold to provide additional liquidity 
at december  and  respectively  federal funds sold and other short term investments were  and additionally  at december   the company had million available from unused federal funds lines and in excess of million in unencumbered securities available for repurchase agreements 
the bank also has a borrower in custody bic line with the federal reserve bank totaling over million as part of its liquidity contingency 
for the company  liquidity is provided by dividends from the bank  cash balances  credit line availability  liquid assets  and proceeds from capital market transactions 
federal banking law limits the amount of capital distributions that national banks can make to their holding companies without obtaining prior regulatory approval 
a national bank s dividend paying capacity is affected by several factors  including the amount of its net profits as defined by statute for the two previous calendar years and net profits for the current year up to the date of dividend declaration 
the company has an unsecured line of credit available which permits it to borrow up to million 
at december  the company had million available for future use 
management believes that the company has adequate liquidity to meet its foreseeable needs 
liquidity for the company is required to support operational expenses of the company  pay taxes  meet the outstanding debt and trust preferred securities obligations of the company  provide dividends to common shareholders and other general corporate purposes 
management believes that funds to fulfill these obligations for will be available from currently available cash and marketable securities  accessing the company s line of credit  dividends to the company  or other sources that management expects to be available during the year 
while management believes that maintaining the current dividend level is important to the company s shareholders  the board of directors will determine on a quarterly basis whether to pay dividends and the amount of the dividend after taking into account the availability of funds  the results of current operations and prospects for future operations  and the need to maintain prudent capital levels at the company and integra bank

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk is the exposure of earnings and capital to changes in interest rates 
fluctuations in rates affect earnings by changing net interest income and other interest sensitive income and expense levels 
interest rate changes affect the market value of capital by altering the underlying value of assets  liabilities and off balance sheet instruments 
the interest rate risk management program for the company is comprised of several components 
the components include board of directors oversight  senior management oversight  risk limits and control  risk identification and measurement  risk monitoring and reporting and independent review 
it is the objective of the company s interest rate risk management processes to manage the impact of interest rate volatility on bank earnings and capital 
at the company  interest rate risk is managed through the corporate asset and liability committee corporate alco with oversight through the alco and finance committee of the board of directors board alco 
the board alco meets at least twice a quarter and is responsible for the establishment of policies  risk limits and authorization levels 
the corporate alco meets at least monthly and is responsible for implementing policies and procedures  overseeing the entire interest rate risk management process and establishing internal controls 
interest rate risk is measured and monitored on a proactive basis by utilizing a simulation model 
the company uses the following key methodologies to measure interest rate risk 
earnings at risk ear 
ear is considered management s best source of managing short term interest rate risk one year time frame 
this measure reflects the dollar amount of net interest income that will be impacted by changes in interest rates 
the company uses a simulation model to run immediate and parallel changes in interest rates from a base scenario using implied forward rates 
the standard simulation analysis assesses the impact on net interest income over a month horizon by shocking the implied forward yield curve up and down   and basis points 
additional yield curve scenarios are tested from time to time to assess the risk to changes in the slope of the yield curve and changes in basis relationships 
these interest rate scenarios are executed against a balance sheet utilizing projected growth and composition 
additional simulations are run from time to time to assess the risk to earnings and liquidity from balance sheet growth occurring faster or slower than anticipated as well as the impact of faster or slower prepayments in the loan and securities portfolio 
this simulation model projects the net interest income forecasted under each scenario and calculates the percentage change from the base interest rate scenario 
the board alco has approved policy limits for changes in one year ear from the base interest rate scenario of minus percent to a basis point rate shock in either direction 
at december   the company would experience a negative change in ear  if interest rates moved downward basis points 
if interest rates moved upward basis points  the company would experience a negative change in net interest income 
both simulation results are within the policy limits established by the board alco 
two major changes factored into the variance in risk at basis points from december to december in  a more conservative approach was employed to measure the pricing behavior risk of money market accounts in a rising rate environment 
this had the effect of reducing the calculated level of asset sensitivity 
though not restated  management believes that the ear benefit in a rising rate scenario was overstated at december  also in  million in fixed rate trust preferred securities were retired and refinanced with lower coupon  floating rate trust preferred securities 
prior to december  the company used the simulation model to calculate these changes assuming that rates and balance sheet composition remain unchanged 
the changes in ear using the unchanged rate and balance sheet composition assumptions produced risk measures that were materially the same as the risk measures produced by the current assumptions 
estimated change in ear from the flat interest rate scenario basis points basis points december  december  economic value of equity eve 
management considers eve to be its best analytical tool for measuring long term interest rate risk 
this measure reflects the dollar amount of net equity that will be impacted by changes in interest rates 
the company uses a simulation model to evaluate the impact of immediate and parallel changes in interest rates from a base scenario using implied forward rates 
the standard simulation analysis assesses the impact on eve by shocking the implied forward yield curve up and down   and basis points 
this simulation model projects the estimated economic value of assets and liabilities under each scenario 
the difference between the economic value of total assets and the economic value of total liabilities is referred to as the economic value of equity 
the simulation model calculates the percentage change from the base interest rate scenario 
the board alco has approved policy limits for changes in eve 
the variance limit for eve is measured in an environment when the base interest rate scenario is shocked up or down basis points 
effective january   the board of directors updated and approved a policy that allows corporate alco to manage eve risk to a basis point rate shock within a range of plus or minus 
the discretionary limit prior to january  had been 
at december   the company would experience a positive change in eve if interest rates moved downward basis points 
if interest rates moved upward basis points  the company would experience a negative change in eve 
both of these measures are within board approved policy limits 
prior to december  the company used the simulation model to calculate these changes assuming that rates remain unchanged 
for eve calculations  future balance sheet composition is not a factor 
the changes in eve using unchanged rates and balance sheet composition assumptions produced risk measures that were materially the same as the risk measures produced by the current assumptions 
estimated change in eve from the flat interest rate scenario basis points basis points december  december  the assumptions in any of these simulation runs are inherently uncertain 
any simulation cannot precisely estimate net interest income or economic value of the assets and liabilities or predict the impact of higher or lower interest rates on net interest income or on the economic value of the assets and liabilities 
actual results will differ from simulated results due to the timing  magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes  the difference between actual experience and the characteristics assumed  as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies
