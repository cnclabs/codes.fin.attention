home respiratory care products 
home respiratory care products represent one of allied s potential growth areas 
allied s broad line of home respiratory care products include aluminum oxygen cylinders  oxygen regulators  pneumatic nebulizers  portable suction equipment and the full line of respiratory disposable products 
medical gas equipment market 
the market for medical gas equipment consists of hospitals  alternate care settings and surgery centers 
the medical gas equipment group is broken down into three separate categories construction products  regulation devices and suction equipment  and disposable cylinders 
construction products 
allied s medical gas system construction products consist of in wall medical system components  central station pumps and compressors  and headwalls 
these products are typically installed during construction or renovation of a health care facility and are built in as an integral part of the facility s physical plant 
typically  the contractor for the facility s construction or renovation purchases medical gas system components from manufacturers and ensures that the design specifications of the health care facility are met 
allied s in wall components  including outlets  manifolds  alarms  ceiling columns and zone valves  serve a fundamental role in medical gas delivery systems 
central station pumps and compressors are individually engineered systems consisting of compressors  reservoirs  valves and controls designed to drive a hospital s medical gas and suction systems 
each system is designed specifically for a given hospital or facility  which purchases pumps and compressors from suppliers 
the company s sales of pumps and compressors are driven  in large part  by its share of the in wall components market 
the company s construction products are sold primarily to hospitals  alternate care settings and hospital construction contractors 
the company believes that it holds a major share of the us market for its construction products  that these products are installed in more than three thousand hospitals in the united states and that its installed base of equipment in this market will continue to generate follow on sales 
the company believes that most hospitals and sub acute care facility construction spending is for expansion or renovation of existing facilities 
many hospital systems and individual hospitals undertake major renovations to upgrade their operations to improve the quality of care they provide  reduce costs and attract patients and personnel 
regulation devices and suction equipment 
the company s medical gas system regulation products include flowmeters  vacuum regulators and pressure regulators  as well as related adapters  fittings and hoses which measure  regulate  monitor and help transfer medical gases from walled piping or equipment to patients in hospital rooms  operating theaters or intensive care areas 
the company s leadership position in the in wall components market provides a competitive advantage in marketing medical gas system regulation devices that are compatible with those components 
portable suction equipment is typically used when in wall suction is not available or when medical protocol specifically requires portable suction 
the company also manufactures disposable suction canisters  which are clear containers used to collect the fluids suctioned by in wall or portable suction systems 
the containers have volume calibrations  which allow the medical practitioner to measure the volume of fluids suctioned 
the market for regulation devices and suction equipment includes hospital and sub acute care facilities 
sales of these products are made through the same distribution channel as our respiratory care products 
the company believes that it holds a significant share of the us market in both regulation devices and suction equipment 
disposable cylinders 
disposable oxygen cylinders are designed to provide oxygen for short periods of time in emergency situations 
since they are not subjected to the same pressurization as standard containers  they are much lighter and less expensive than standard gas cylinders 
the company markets filled disposable oxygen cylinders through industrial safety distributors and similar customers  principally to first aid providers  restaurants  industrial plants and other customers that require oxygen for infrequent emergencies 
emergency medical products market 
emergency medical products are used in the treatment of trauma induced injuries 
the company s emergency medical products provide patient resuscitation or ventilation during cardiopulmonary resuscitation or respiratory distress as well as immobilization and treatment for burns 
the company believes that the trauma care venue for health care services is positioned for growth in light of the continuing trend towards providing health care outside the traditional hospital setting 
the company also expects that other countries will develop trauma care systems in the future  although no assurance can be given that such systems will develop or that they will have a favorable impact on the company 
sales of emergency medical products are made through specialized emergency medical products distributors to ambulance companies  fire departments and emergency medical systems volunteer organizations 
the emergency medical products are broken down into two categories respiratory resuscitator products and trauma patient handling products 
respiratory resuscitation products 
the company s respiratory resuscitation products include demand resuscitation valves  portable resuscitation systems  bag masks and related products  emergency transport ventilators  precision oxygen regulators  minilators  multilators and humidifiers 
demand resuscitation valves are designed to provide oxygen to breathing or non breathing patients 
in an emergency situation  they can be used with a mask or tracheotomy tubes and operate from a standard regulated oxygen system 
the company s portable resuscitation systems provide fast  simple and effective means of ventilating a non breathing patient during cardiopulmonary resuscitation and oxygen to breathing patients on demand with minimal inspiratory effort 
the company also markets a full line of disposable and reusable bag mask resuscitators  which are available in a variety of adult and child size configurations 
disposable mouth to mask resuscitation systems have the added advantage of reducing the risk of transmission of communicable diseases 
the company s autovent transport ventilator can meet a variety of needs in different applications ranging from typical emergency medical situations to more sophisticated air and ground transport 
each autovent is accompanied by a patient valve  which provides effective ventilation during cardiopulmonary resuscitation or respiratory distress 
when administration of oxygen is required at the scene of a disaster  in military field hospitals or in a multiple victim incident  allied s minilators and multilators are capable of providing oxygen to one or a large number of patients 
to complement the family of respiratory resuscitation products  the company offers a full line of oxygen product accessories 
this line of accessory products includes reusable aspirators  tru fit masks  disposable cuffed masks and related accessories 
trauma and patient handling products 
the company s trauma and patient handling products include spine immobilization products  pneumatic anti shock garments and trauma burn kits 
spine immobilization products include a backboard that is designed for safe immobilization of injury victims and provides a durable and cost effective means of emergency patient transportation and extrication 
the infant pediatric immobilization board is durable and scaled for children 
the half back extractor rescue vest is useful for both suspected cervical spinal injuries and for mountain and air rescues 
the company s pneumatic anti shock garments are used to treat victims experiencing hypovolemic shock 
allied s trauma burn kits contain a comprehensive line of products for the treatment of trauma and burns 
sales and marketing allied sells its products primarily to respiratory care anesthesia product distributors  hospital construction contractors  emergency medical equipment dealers and directly to hospitals 
the company maintains a sales force of sales professionals  all of whom are full time employees of the company 
the sales force includes medical gas specialists  emergency specialists and international sales representatives 
two product managers are responsible for the marketing activities of our product lines 
the medical gas specialists are responsible for sales of all allied products with the exception of emergency products within their territory 
sales of products are accomplished through respiratory care anesthesia distributors for the regulation devices  suction equipment  respiratory care anesthesia products and disposable cylinders 
the homecare products are sold primarily through our own in house telemarketing 
construction products are sold direct to hospital construction contractors and through distributors 
emergency medical specialists are responsible for sales of respiratory resuscitation products  trauma and patient handling products 
these products are principally sold to ambulance companies  fire departments and emergency medical systems volunteer organizations through specialized emergency medical products distributors 
allied s international business represents a potential growth area that the company has been pursuing 
allied s net sales to foreign markets totaled of the company s net sales in fiscal  of the company s net sales in fiscal  and of the company s net sales in fiscal international sales are made through a network of dealers  agents and us exporters who distribute the company s products throughout the world 
allied has market presence in canada  mexico  central and south america  europe  the middle east and the far east 
manufacturing allied s manufacturing processes include fabrication  electro mechanical assembly operations and plastics manufacturing 
a significant part of allied s manufacturing operations involves electro mechanical assembly of proprietary products and the company is vertically integrated in most elements of metal machining and fabrication 
most of allied s hourly employees are involved in machining  metal fabrication  plastics manufacturing and product assembly 
allied manufactures small metal components from bar stock in a machine shop  which includes automatic screw machines  horizontal lathes and drill presses and computer controlled machining centers 
the company makes larger metal components from sheet metal using computerized punch presses  brake presses and shears 
in its plastics manufacturing processes  the company utilizes both extrusion and injection molding 
the company believes that its production facilities and equipment are in good condition and sufficient to meet planned increases in volume over the next few years and that the conditions in local labor markets should permit the implementation of additional shifts and days operated 
research and development allied s research and development group is responsible for the development of new products 
this group is staffed with mechanical and electrical engineers 
during fiscal year the research and development group completed the design and released to manufacturing a new suction pump for the emergency market and a cost reduced regulator design 
the new suction pump provides the ems market with a rugged suction pump that is battery operated 
this suction pump also includes a docking station for mounting in an emergency vehicle 
the docking station is capable of recharging the battery or running the unit if the battery is low 
the research and development group has also completed the design of an additional product 
manufacturing is in the process of preparing to produce this product 
this product is expected to be released for sale during the second quarter of fiscal year as part of the agreement relating to the withdrawal of the baralyme r product  abbott has agreed to pay to allied up to  in product development costs to pursue development of a new carbon dioxide absorption product for use in connection with inhalation anesthetics that does not contain potassium hydroxide and does not produce a significant exothermic reaction with currently available inhalation agents 
it is allied s intention to pursue development of a new carbon dioxide absorption product 
more detailed information concerning this agreement is included in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
government regulation the company s products and its manufacturing activities are subject to extensive and rigorous government regulation by federal and state authorities in the united states and other countries 
in the united states  medical devices for human use are subject to comprehensive review by the united states food and drug administration the fda 
the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act fdc act  and other federal statutes and regulations  govern or influence the research  testing  manufacture  safety  labeling  storage  record keeping  approval  advertising and promotion of such products 
noncompliance with applicable requirements can result in warning letters  fines  recall or seizure of products  injunction  refusal to permit products to be imported into or exported out of the united states  refusal of the government to clear or approve marketing applications or to allow the company to enter into government supply contracts  or withdrawal of previously approved marketing applications and criminal prosecution 
the company is required to file a premarket notification in the form of a premarket approval pma with the fda before it begins marketing a new medical device that offers new technology that is currently not on the market 
the company also must file a premarket notification in the form of a k with the fda before it begins marketing a new medical device that utilizes existing technology for devices that are currently on the market 
the k submission process is also required when the company makes a change or modifies an existing device in a manner that could significantly affect the device s safety or effectiveness 
compliance with the regulatory approval process in order to market a new or modified medical device can be uncertain  lengthy and  in some cases  expensive 
there can be no assurance that necessary regulatory approvals will be obtained on a timely basis  or at all 
delays in receipt or failure to receive such approvals  the loss of previously received approvals  or failure to comply with existing or future regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company manufactures and distributes a broad spectrum of respiratory therapy equipment  emergency medical equipment and medical gas equipment 
to date  all of the company s fda clearances have been obtained through the k clearance process 
these determinations are very fact specific and the fda has stated that  initially  the manufacturer is best qualified to make these determinations  which should be based on adequate supporting data and documentation 
the fda however  may disagree with a manufacturer s determination not to file a k and require the submission of a new k notification for the changed or modified device 
where the fda believes that the change or modification raises significant new questions of safety or effectiveness  the agency may require a manufacturer to cease distribution of the device pending clearance of a new k notification 
certain of the company s medical devices have been changed or modified subsequent to k marketing clearance of the original device by the fda 
certain of the company s medical devices  which were first marketed prior to may   and therefore  grandfathered and exempt from the k notification process  also have been subsequently changed or modified 
the company believes that these changes or modifications do not significantly affect the devices safety or effectiveness  or make a major change or modification in the devices intended uses and  accordingly  submission of new k notification to the fda is not required 
there can be no assurance  however  that the fda would agree with the company s determinations 
in addition  commercial distribution in certain foreign countries is subject to additional regulatory requirements and receipt of approvals that vary widely from country to country 
the company believes it is in compliance with regulatory requirements of the countries in which it sells its products 
the medical device reporting regulation requires that the company provide information to the fda on deaths or serious injuries alleged to have been associated with the use of its devices  as well as product malfunctions that would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur 
the medical device tracking regulation requires the company to adopt a method of device tracking of certain devices  such as ventilators  which are life supporting or life sustaining devices used outside of a device user facility  some of which are permanently implantable devices 
the regulation requires that the method adopted by the company will ensure that the tracked device can be traced from the device manufacturer to the person for whom the device is indicated ie  the patient 
in addition  the fda prohibits a company from promoting an approved device for unapproved applications and reviews a company s labeling for accuracy 
labeling and promotional activities also are in certain instances  subject to scrutiny by the federal trade commission 
the company s medical device manufacturing facilities are registered with the fda  and have received iso certification for the st 
louis facility and certification per the medical device directive mdd european for certain products in as such  the company will be audited by the fda  iso  and european auditors for compliance with the good manufacturing practices gmp  the iso and mdd regulations for medical devices 
these regulations require the company to manufacture its products and maintain its products and documentation in a prescribed manner with respect to design  manufacturing  testing and control activities 
the company also is subject to the registration and inspection requirements of state regulatory agencies 
there can be no assurance that any required fda or other governmental approval will be granted  or  if granted  will not be withdrawn 
governmental regulation may prevent or substantially delay the marketing of the company s proposed products and cause the company to undertake costly procedures 
in addition  the extent of potentially adverse government regulation that might arise from future administrative action or legislation cannot be predicted 
any failure to obtain  or delay in obtaining  such approvals could adversely affect the company s ability to market its proposed products 
sales of medical devices outside the united states are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country 
medical products shipped to the european community require ce certification 
whether or not fda approval has been obtained  approval of a device by a comparable regulatory authority of a foreign country generally must be obtained prior to the commencement of marketing in those countries 
the time required to obtain such approvals may be longer or shorter than that required for fda approval 
in addition  fda approval may be required under certain circumstances to export certain medical devices 
the company is also subject to numerous federal  state and local laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions  manufacturing practices  environmental protections  fire hazard control and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances 
third party reimbursement the cost of a majority of medical care in the united states is funded by the us government through the medicare and medicaid programs and by private insurance programs  such as corporate health insurance plans 
although the company does not receive payments for its products directly from these programs  home respiratory care providers and durable medical equipment suppliers  who are the primary customers for several of the company s products  depend heavily on payments from medicare  medicaid and private insurers as a major source of revenues 
in addition  sales of certain of the company s products are affected by the extent of hospital and health care facility construction and renovation at any given time 
the federal government indirectly funds a significant percentage of such construction and renovation costs through medicare and medicaid reimbursements 
in recent years  governmentally imposed limits on reimbursement to hospitals and other health care providers have impacted spending for services  consumables and capital goods 
a material decrease from current reimbursement levels or a material change in the method or basis of reimbursing health care providers is likely to adversely affect future sales of the company s products 
patents  trademarks and proprietary technology the company owns and maintains patents on several products it believes are useful to the business and provides the company with an advantage over its competitors 
during fiscal the company was granted a patent on the surgex post valve and continues to pursue several more on the surgex product 
the company also applied for a patent on the xtra backboard design 
the company owns and maintains us trademark registrations for chemetron  gomco  oxequip  lif o gen  life support products  timeter  vacutron and schuco  its principal trademarks 
registrations for these trademarks are also owned and maintained in countries where such products are sold and such registrations are considered necessary to preserve the company s proprietary rights therein 
competition the company has different competitors within each of its product lines 
many of the company s principal competitors are larger than allied and the company believes that most of these competitors have greater financial and other resources 
the company competes primarily on the basis of price  quality and service 
the company believes that it is well positioned with respect to product cost  brand recognition  product reliability  and customer service to compete effectively in each of its markets 
employees at june   the company had approximately full time employees

louis  missouri  are covered by a collective bargaining agreement that will expire on may  approximately employees at the company s facility in stuyvesant falls  new york are also covered by a collective bargaining agreement scheduled to expire on april  on august   allied healthcare products  inc allied entered into an agreement with abbott laboratories abbott pursuant to which allied will cease production of its product baralyme r  will  within sixty days  effect the withdrawal of baralyme r product held by distributors and will pursue the development of a new carbon dioxide absorbent product 
baralyme r  a carbon dioxide absorbent product  has been used safely and effectively in connection with inhalation anesthetics since its introduction in the s 
in recent years  the number of inhalation anesthetics has increased  giving rise to concerns regarding the use of baralyme r in conjunction with these newer inhalation anesthetics when baralyme r has been allowed  contrary to recommended practice  to become desiccated 
the agreement also provides that  for a period of eight years  allied will not manufacture  distribute  promote  market  sell  commercialize or donate any baralyme r product or similar product based upon potassium hydroxide and will not develop or license any new carbon dioxide absorbent product containing potassium hydroxide 
more detailed information concerning this agreement is included in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations certain statements contained herein are forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those anticipated as a result of various factors  including cyclical and other industry downturns  the effects of federal and state legislation on health care reform  including medicare and medicaid financing  the inability to realize the full benefit of recent capital expenditures or consolidation and rationalization activities  difficulties or delays in the introduction of new products or disruptions in selling  manufacturing and or shipping efforts the following discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting the consolidated operating results and financial condition of the company for the three fiscal years ended june  this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  notes to the consolidated financial statements and selected consolidated financial data included elsewhere herein 
critical accounting policies in preparing financial statements  management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the company evaluates estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis  including those related to bad debts  inventory valuations  property  plant and equipment  intangible assets  income taxes  and contingencies and litigation 
estimates and judgments are based on historical experience and on various other factors that may be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
the following areas are considered to be the company s most significant accounting policies revenue recognition revenue is recognized for all sales  including sales to agents and distributors  at the time products are shipped and title has transferred to the customer  provided that a purchase order has been received or a contract has been executed  there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance  the sales price has been fixed and determinable and collectibility is deemed probable 
the company s standard shipping terms are fob shipping point 
sales discounts  returns and allowances are included in net sales  and the provision for doubtful accounts is included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
additionally  it is the company s practice to include revenues generated from freight billed to customers in net sales with corresponding freight expense included in cost of sales in the consolidated statement of operations 
inventory reserve for obsolete and excess inventory inventory is recorded net of a reserve for obsolete and excess inventory which is determined based on an analysis of inventory items with no usage in the preceding year and for inventory items for which there is greater than two year s usage on hand 
this analysis considers those identified inventory items to determine  in management s best estimate  if parts can be used beyond one year  if there are alternate uses or at what values such parts may be disposed for 
during the fiscal year ended june   the company implemented this detailed analysis of inventory in conjunction with its long term product planning process 
this review indicated that due to changes in product mix  other manufacturing changes to the company s products  and declines in sales  a large number of component parts were deemed to be obsolete  resulting in a million charge to increase the company s reserve for obsolete and excess inventory 
at june  and  inventory is recorded net of a reserve for obsolete and excess inventory of million and million  respectively 
accounts receivable allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable are recorded net of an allowance for doubtful accounts which is determined based on an analysis of past due accounts and accounts placed with collection agencies 
at june  and  accounts receivable is recorded net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of million 
goodwill at june  and  the company has goodwill of  resulting from the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations 
during fiscal  the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which establishes new accounting and reporting standards for purchase business combinations and goodwill 
as provided by sfas no 
 the company ceased amortizing goodwill on july  during the first half of fiscal  the company performed the transitional impairment analysis of its goodwill as of the implementation date  following which the company concluded that there was no impairment of goodwill at july  the company completed the required initial annual impairment review of its goodwill at june   which due to declining sales and profitability  resulted in a goodwill impairment loss of  the company conducts a formal impairment test of goodwill on an annual basis and between its annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the company below its carrying value 
the annual impairment test did not indicate a further impairment of goodwill at june  or june  the results of these annual impairment reviews are highly dependent on management s projection of future results of the company and there can be no assurance that at the time such reviews are completed a material impairment charge will not be recorded 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional disclosure 
significant factors affecting past and future operating results the results of operations for fiscal were affected by several unusual items  which are discussed further below 
during the first half of fiscal the company transferred production of its b f line of disposable homecare products to its st 
louis manufacturing facility 
inefficiencies associated with the transfer significantly reduced gross margins 
as a result of the company s annual impairment analysis of goodwill  the company recorded a million goodwill impairment charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal the goodwill impairment charge was primarily attributable to the declining results in the disposable home care products line 
in addition  during the fourth quarter the company recorded a pre tax charge of million to increase its reserve for slow moving and obsolete inventory 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  a detailed review of inventory was performed 
this review indicated that due to changes in product mix  other manufacturing changes to the company s products  and declines in sales levels  a large number of component parts were deemed to be obsolete 
on august   allied healthcare products  inc allied entered into an agreement with abbott laboratories abbott pursuant to which allied will cease production of its product baralyme r  will  within sixty days  effect the withdrawal of baralyme r product held by distributors and will pursue the development of a new carbon dioxide absorbent product 
baralyme r  a carbon dioxide absorbent product  has been used safely and effectively in connection with inhalation anesthetics since its introduction in the s 
in recent years  the number of inhalation anesthetics has increased  giving rise to concerns regarding the use of baralyme r in conjunction with these newer inhalation anesthetics when baralyme r has been allowed  contrary to recommended practice  to become desiccated 
the agreement also provides that  for a period of eight years  allied will not manufacture  distribute  promote  market  sell  commercialize or donate any baralyme r product or similar product based upon potassium hydroxide and will not develop or license any new carbon dioxide absorbent product containing potassium hydroxide 
in consideration of the foregoing  abbott has agreed to pay allied an aggregate of  of which  is currently due and the remainder payable in equal annual installments of  due on july  through july  allied has agreed with abbott that in the event that it receives approval from the us food drug administration for the commercial sale of a new carbon dioxide absorbent product not based upon potassium hydroxide prior to january   that abbott will be relieved of any obligation to fund the  installment due july  allied expects to suspend manufacturing operations at its stuyvesant falls  new york  facility and anticipates that costs associated with the withdrawal and suspension of operations at that location  including severance and benefit payments due union employees  will be approximately  in addition to the provisions of the agreement relating to the withdrawal of the baralyme r product  abbott has agreed to pay to allied up to  in product development costs to pursue development of a new carbon dioxide absorption product for use in connection with inhalation anesthetics that does not contain potassium hydroxide and does not produce a significant exothermic reaction with currently available inhalation agents 
in  allied s sales of baralyme r were approximately million and contributed approximately  in pre tax earnings and cash flow from operations 
the majority of the  allied is to receive from abbott will be recognized into income over the eight year term of the agreement 
the net cash flow expected to be realized by allied under the agreement with abbott is projected be substantially equivalent to the net cash flow allied would have expected to realize from continued manufacture and sales of baralyme r during the initial five years of the period 
results of operations allied manufactures and markets respiratory products  including respiratory care products  medical gas equipment and emergency medical products 
set forth below is certain information with respect to amounts and percentages of net sales attributable to respiratory care products  medical gas equipment and emergency medical products for the fiscal years ended june    and year ended june  net of total sales net sales dollars in thousands respiratory care products  medical gas equipment  emergency medical products  total  year ended june  net of total sales net sales respiratory care products  medical gas equipment  emergency medical products  total  year ended june  net of total sales net sales respiratory care products  medical gas equipment  emergency medical products  total  the following table sets forth  for the fiscal periods indicated  the percentage of net sales represented by the various income and expense categories reflected in the company s consolidated statement of operations

domestically  sales increased in all regions of the country except in the company s eastern region 
the company has reorganized its sales organization to better serve that market 
internationally  sales decreased by million dollars 
international business is dependent upon hospital construction projects  and the development of medical facilities in those regions in which the company operates 
the million dollar decrease in international shipments includes a million dollar decrease in sales to latin america  where economic progress has been uneven over the last several years 
respiratory care products sales in fiscal of million were million  or less than sales of million in the prior year 
this decrease is attributable to a decline in the sales of the company s b f line of homecare products 
the company has not been able to regain market share lost from delivery problems in prior years 
these delivery problems are now rectified  and the company continues to pursue this market 
medical gas equipment sales of million in fiscal were million  or less than prior year levels of million 
of this decrease million came from a decrease in international business 
as discussed above  international business is dependent upon hospital construction projects and the development of medical facilities in those regions in which the company operates 
domestic sales of medical gas equipment decreased by million  or emergency medical product sales in fiscal of million were million or less than fiscal sales of million 
international sales of emergency medical products declined by million  while domestic sales increased by million 
international sales  which are included in the product lines discussed above  decreased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to sales of million in fiscal as discussed above  the company s international shipments are dependent on hospital construction projects and the expansion of medical care in those regions 
in fiscal  international shipments of medical gas equipment decreased by million dollars 
in addition  sales of respiratory care products decreased by million dollars  and emergency medical products decreased by million dollars 
gross profit in fiscal was million  or of sales  compared to a gross profit of million  or of sales in fiscal in fiscal the company continued to improve production efficiency and automation 
the company invested million in capital expenditures during fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal for manufacturing equipment  which continues to decrease production costs and improve efficiencies for several product lines 
in addition  gross profit improved million as a result of a distribution representing the company s membership interest in the liquidation of the general american mutual holding company  the company s health care benefit provider 
these savings were partially offset by an approximately million increase in worker s compensation insurance  and the decreases to gross margins attributable to lower sales volumes 
selling  general  and administrative sg a expenses for fiscal were million  a decrease of million over sg a expenses of million in fiscal this decrease is the result of two main factors 
on july th  the company announced an immediate workforce reduction of positions from its managerial and administrative staff 
sg a expenses decreased million during fiscal primarily from this staff reduction 
the company s sg a expenses decreased by million as a result of a decrease in the cost of property and casualty insurance
