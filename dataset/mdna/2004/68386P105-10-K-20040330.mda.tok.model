item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which are included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
see index to financial statements beginning at page f overview 
we are an integrated eye care services company focused on vision benefits management managed vision  retail optical sales and eye care services to patients and the distribution of products and software services to eye care professionals 
on february   we acquired substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of the contact lens distribution business of wise optical vision group  inc wise optical  a new york corporation 
the results of operations of wise optical are included in the consolidated financial statements from february   the deemed effective date of the acquisition for accounting purposes 
we have experienced substantial losses at wise optical in these losses were largely attributable to significant expenses incurred by wise optical  including integration costs primarily severance and stay bonuses  legal and professional fees  weakness in gross margins and an operating structure built to support a higher sales volume 
in september  we began implementing strategies and operational changes designed to improve the operations of wise optical 
these efforts include developing our sales force  improving customer service  enhancing productivity  eliminating positions and streamlining our warehouse and distribution processes 
in addition  effective september   gordon bishop  president of our consumer vision division  replaced the former president of the distribution division 
mr 
bishop brings industry expertise and a strong optical background to wise  along with a focus on operating expenses 
we believe these changes will lead to increased sales  improved gross margins and reduced operating costs in  however if the losses at wise optical continue it could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and or liquidity 
on may   palisade concentrated equity partnership  lp  our majority shareholder  and linda yimoyines  wife of dean j 
yimoyines  md  our chairman of the board and chief executive officer  each exchanged the entire amount of principal and interest due to them under our senior subordinated secured notes payable  totaling an aggregate of million  for a total of  shares of series c preferred stock 
in the third and fourth quarters of we failed to comply with the minimum fixed charge ratio covenant under our revolving credit facility with capitalsource finance  llc  for which we received a waiver 
due to our covenant failure in the third quarter of and anticipated cash constraints in december through february  both of which are mainly due to operating losses at wise optical and seasonality in our business  on november   we amended our term loan and revolving credit facility 
as part of the amendment  we received i an additional million term loan  ii an extension of the maturity dates of our term loan and revolving credit facility to january   iii a waiver for non compliance with the minimum fixed charge ratio covenant through march  and iv a million temporary over advance on our revolving credit facility  which was fully repaid by march  management believes it will comply with its future financial covenants beyond the date of the current waiver  however  if operating losses continue and we fail to comply with financial covenants in the future or otherwise default on our debt  our creditors could foreclose on our assets 
our business is comprised of three reportable operating segments managed vision  consumer vision  and distribution technology 
our managed vision division contracts with insurers  managed care plans and other third party payers to manage claims payment administration of eye health benefits for contracting parties 
our consumer vision division sells retail optical products to consumers and operates integrated eye health centers and surgical facilities in connecticut where comprehensive eye care services are provided to patients 
our distribution technology division provides products and services to eye care professionals ophthalmologists  optometrists and opticians through i wise optical  a distributor of contact and ophthalmic lenses and other eye care accessories and supplies  ii a buying group program  which provides group purchasing arrangements for optical and ophthalmic goods and supplies and iii cc systems  which provides systems and software solutions to eye care professionals 
in addition to these segments  we receive income from other non core operations and transactions  including our health service organization hso operation which receives fee income for providing certain support services to individual ophthalmology and optometry practices 
while we continue to provide the required services to these practices  we are in the process of generally disengaging from a number of these operations 
see legal proceedings health services organization lawsuits critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
estimates are adjusted as new information becomes available 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
services revenue through our affiliated professional corporation  opticare pc  our consumer vision division provides to consumers comprehensive eye care services  including medical and surgical treatment of eye diseases and disorders by ophthalmologists  and vision measuring and non surgical treatments and correction services by optometrists 
we charge a fee for providing the use of our ambulatory surgery center to professionals for surgical procedures 
our ophthalmic  optometric and ambulatory surgery center services are recorded at established rates  reduced by an estimate for contractual allowances and doubtful accounts 
contractual allowances arise due to the terms of certain reimbursement contracts with third party payers that provide for payments to us at amounts different from our established rates 
the contractual allowance represents the difference between the charges at established rates and estimated recoverable amounts and is recognized in the period the services are rendered 
the contractual allowance recorded is estimated based on an analysis of historical collection experience in relation to amounts billed and other relevant information 
any differences between estimated contractual adjustments and actual final settlements under reimbursement contracts are recognized as adjustments to revenue in the period of final settlements 
historically  we have not had significant adjustments to this estimate 
medical claims expense claims expense is recorded as provider services are rendered and includes an estimate for claims incurred but not reported 
reserves for estimated insurance losses are determined on a case by case basis for reported claims  and on estimates based on our experience for loss adjustment expenses and incurred but not reported claims 
these liabilities give effect to trends in claims severity and other factors which may vary as the losses are ultimately settled 
we believe that our estimates of the reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses are reasonable  however  there is considerable variability inherent in the reserve estimates 
these estimates are continually reviewed and  as adjustments to these liabilities become necessary  such adjustments are reflected in current operations in the period of the adjustment 
historically  we have not had significant adjustments to this estimate 
goodwill goodwill  which arises from the purchase price exceeding the assigned value of net assets of acquired businesses  represents the value attributable to unidentifiable intangible elements being acquired 
of the total goodwill included on our consolidated balance sheet  approximately is recorded in our managed vision segment  in our consumer vision segment and in our distribution technology segment 
on an annual basis  or as circumstances dictate  management reviews goodwill and evaluates events or other developments that may indicate impairment in the carrying value 
the evaluation methodology for potential impairment is inherently complex  and involves significant management judgment in the use of estimates and assumptions 
we use multiples of revenue and earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization of comparable entities to value the reporting unit being evaluated for goodwill impairment 
we evaluate impairment using a two step process 
first  we compare the aggregate fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying amount  no impairment exists 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value  then we compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with its carrying amount 
the implied fair value is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all the assets and liabilities of that unit  as if the unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the unit was the purchase price 
if the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value  then goodwill impairment is recognized by writing the goodwill down to the implied fair value 
in the third and fourth quarters of  we recorded an impairment charge to goodwill as a result of a loss of a major customer in our buying group and poor operating performance in our wise optical reporting unit 
adverse changes in our business climate  revenues or profitability could require further reductions to the carrying value of our goodwill in future periods 
events that may indicate goodwill impairment include significant or adverse changes in business or economic climate  an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  unanticipated competition  loss of key personnel  and the sale or expected sale disposal of a reporting unit 
due to uncertain market conditions it is possible that that the financial information used to support our goodwill may change in the future  which could result in non cash charges that would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
see note to consolidated financial statements 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes which requires an asset and liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes 
under the asset and liability method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years the temporary differences are expected to reverse 
our determination of the likelihood that deferred tax assets can be realized is based on our examination of available evidence  which involves estimates and assumptions 
we consider future market growth  forecasted earnings  future taxable income and known future events in determining the need for a valuation allowance 
in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made 
in the third quarter of  we recorded a valuation reserve against our entire deferred tax assets due to historical operating losses 
as we experience future profitability  we expect to reduce or eliminate the valuation reserve 
see note to consolidated financial statements 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  managed vision revenue 
managed vision revenue represents fees received under our managed care contracts 
managed vision revenue decreased to approximately million for the year ended december   from approximately million for the year ended december   a decrease of approximately million or 
during the second quarter of the texas state legislature made changes to its medicaid program and as a result hmo blue  with whom we maintained a medicaid contract  withdrew from texas medicaid program effective september  therefore  our contract with hmo blue terminated on september  this contract generated revenue of approximately million in compared to approximately million in in addition and also effective september   the texas state legislature decided to no longer fund a vision benefit in its children s health insurance program or provide vision hardware benefits to those over the age of we maintained a number of contracts through this program that reduced benefits and or terminated on september  and these contracts generated revenues of approximately million in and approximately million in while this could become a trend in other states  we do not expect it to have a material impact on future revenue since we do not have a significant number of similar contracts in other states 
other decreased revenue of approximately million was primarily from contracts not renewed in  and was partially offset by increased revenue of approximately million from new contracts and growth in existing contracts 
cigna experienced a decline in membership in january  which translates into an approximate million decline in our annual revenue  however  a new contract with a different payor became effective march   which will offset this decrease in revenue 
we expect future revenue to increase due to new contracts related to our to direct to employer initiative 
product sales revenue 
product sales primarily include the sale of optical products through wise optical  our buying group and our consumer vision segment 
product sales revenue increased to approximately million for the year ended december   from approximately million for the year ended december   an increase of approximately million or 
this increase is primarily due to our acquisition of wise optical on february   which generated product sales revenue of approximately million and an approximate million increase in consumer vision product sales  primarily from an increase in purchasing volume as a result of sales incentives 
this increase in revenue is partially offset by an approximate million decrease in buying group revenue  due to a decrease in sales volume 
the decrease in buying group sales volume is primarily due to the loss of the business of optometric eye care centers  pa and its franchise affiliates and  to a lesser extent  consolidation in the eye care industry whereby smaller independent eye care businesses are being replaced by larger eye care chains that purchase directly from vendors 
we expect consolidation in this market to continue and potentially further reduce the buying group s market share revenue  however  we do not expect this trend to have a material impact on our overall profitability due to the low margins inherent in this business 
we expect wise optical revenue to increase based on an increase in sales volume as a result of initiatives we began in september other services revenue 
other services revenue includes revenue earned from providing eye care services in our consumer vision segment  software services in our distribution technology segment and hso services 
services revenue increased to approximately million for the year ended december   from approximately million for the year ended december   an increase of approximately million or 
this increase includes an approximate million increase in consumer vision services revenue due to increased services volume in the optometry and surgical areas due to increased doctor coverage and an approximate million increase in software services revenue due to an increase in sales volume due to improved management focus 
these increases were offset by an approximate million decrease in fees collected under our hso agreements primarily due to disputes with certain physician practices  which are parties to these agreements  and due to hso settlements which cancelled these agreements for the future 
we continue to be in litigation with several of these practices and intend to continue to pursue settlement of these matters in the future 
while we expect future hso revenue to decline  we believe this will be more than off set by growth in consumer vision 
other income 
other income represents non recurring settlements on health service organization contracts 
other income increased to approximately million for the year ended december  from approximately million for the year ended december  medical claims expense 
medical claims expense decreased to million for the year ended december   from approximately million for the year ended december   a decrease of approximately million 
the medical claims expense loss ratio mlr representing medical claims expense as a percentage of managed vision revenue increased to in from in the mlr was lower in primarily due to a favorable adjustment to the reserve of approximately million in from a contract settlement 
excluding this adjustment  mlr for would have been compared to in in addition  the mlr in was negatively impacted by the recent change in the texas state legislature  which no longer funds a vision benefit in its children s health insurance program and vision hardware to medicaid recipients over the age of as a result  we experienced an increase in claims as utilization increased prior to the elimination of the benefit 
cost of product sales 
cost of product sales increased to approximately million for the year ended december   from approximately million for the year ended december   an increase of approximately million or 
this increase is primarily due to a million increase in product costs related to the increase in sales from the acquisition of wise optical in february the increase in product costs is partially offset by an approximate million decrease in product costs associated with our buying group due to a decrease in sales volume and an approximate million decrease in product costs in our consumer vision business primarily as a result of a shift in product mix to higher margin products as a result of sales incentives  a shift that we expect will continue into the future 
cost of services 
cost of services increased to approximately million for the year ended december   compared to approximately million for the year ended december   an increase of approximately million or 
of this increase approximately million is due to the increase in software sales volume and million is due to the increase in consumer vision services 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to approximately million for the year ended december   from approximately million for the year ended december   an increase of approximately million 
of this increase  approximately million represents operating expenses of wise optical and includes approximately million of wise optical integration related costs consisting primarily of severance  stay bonuses  legal  consulting and other professional fees 
the remaining increase is primarily attributed to costs we incurred as part of our direct to employer initiative in the managed vision segment  including legal  consulting  compensation costs for a new sales force and other professional fees 
while we expect most of these cost to continue into the future  they will be offset by direct to employer sales revenue 
goodwill impairment charge 
for the year ended december   we recorded a non cash goodwill impairment loss of approximately million in our distribution and technology segment  due to decreases in buying group sales and significant operating losses at wise optical 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased to approximately million for the year ended december  from approximately million for the year ended december   a decrease of million 
this decrease in interest expense is primarily due to the decrease in the average outstanding debt balance  primarily due to the conversion of debt to preferred stock in may gain loss from early extinguishment of debt 
the approximate million loss from early extinguishment of debt for the year ended december   primarily represents the write off of deferred debt issuance costs and debt discount associated with the exchange of approximately million of debt for series c preferred stock  which occurred on may  and the amendment of our term loan with capitalsource on november  the approximate million gain on extinguishment of debt for the year ended december  was the result of our capital restructuring in january the gain is comprised of approximately million of forgiveness of principal and interest by bank austria  our former senior secured lender  and was partially offset by the write off of million of related unamortized deferred financing fees and debt discount 
income tax expense benefit 
for the year ended december   we recorded approximately million of income tax expense  which includes approximately million of tax expense to establish a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets and is partially offset by an approximate million income tax benefit on our loss from continuing operations 
the valuation allowance was established based on the weight of historic available evidence  that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the tax expense for the year ended december  of approximately million was primarily due to approximately million of tax expense associated with the approximate million gain on extinguishment of debt  partially offset by an approximate million of tax benefit on other operating losses 
discontinued operations 
in may  our board of directors approved our plan to dispose of the net assets used in the retail optical and optometry practice locations we operated in north carolina 
on august   we consummated the sale of those assets  which resulted in a million loss on disposal in  including income tax expense of million 
we reported million of income from discontinued operations  net of tax  for the year ended december   representing income from this operation prior to disposal 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  managed vision revenue 
managed vision revenue represents fees received under our managed care contracts 
managed vision revenue increased to approximately million for the year ended december   from approximately million for the year ended december   an increase of approximately million or 
managed vision revenue increased due to new contracts and growth within existing contracts  partially offset by a decrease in revenue largely due to the non renewal of three contracts 
product sales revenue 
product sales primarily include the retail sale of optical products in our consumer vision segment and the sale of optical products through our buying group 
product sales revenue decreased to approximately million for the year ended december   from approximately million for the year ended december   a decrease of approximately million or 
of this decrease  approximately million represents a decrease in buying group revenue and approximately million represents a decrease in retail optical revenue resulting from a decrease in purchasing volume 
the decrease in buying group volume is primarily due to consolidation in the eye care industry whereby smaller independent eye care businesses are being replaced by larger eye care chains that purchase directly from vendors 
other services revenue 
other services revenue includes revenue earned from providing eye care services in our consumer vision segment  software services in our distribution technology segment and hso services 
services revenue decreased to approximately million for the year ended december   from approximately million for the year ended december   a decrease of approximately million or 
this decrease includes an approximate million decrease in health service organization revenue  which was offset by an approximate million increase in consumer vision services revenue and a million increase in software services revenue 
the approximate million increase in consumer vision services was due to increased services volume in the optometry and ophthalmology areas 
the million increase in software services revenue was primarily due to an increase in sales volume 
other income 
other income for the year ended december  of approximately million represents non recurring settlements on health service organization contracts 
we had no other income in medical claims expense 
medical claims expense decreased to approximately million for the year ended december   from approximately million for the year ended december   a decrease of approximately million 
this decrease was primarily due to an approximate million favorable adjustment to the reserve in the medical claims expense loss ratio mlr representing medical claims expense as a percentage of managed vision revenue improved to in  from in  primarily due to the favorable adjustment of approximately million in excluding this adjustment  mlr for would have been compared to for cost of product sales 
cost of product sales decreased to approximately million for the year ended december   from approximately million for the year ended december   a decrease of approximately million or 
this decrease in cost of sales is due to decreases in sales volume in our buying group and retail optometry operations 
cost of services 
cost of services decreased to approximately million for the year ended december   compared to approximately million for the year ended december   a decrease of approximately million or 
this decrease was comprised of an approximate million decrease in cost of services associated with consumer vision services as a result of cost containment initiatives  partially offset by an approximate million increase in technology services expense associated with an increase in sales

amortization expense decreased to approximately million for the year ended december  from approximately million for the year ended december  due to the discontinuation of the amortization of goodwill effective january  in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
interest expense 
interest expense remained unchanged at approximately million for each of the years ended december  and although we reduced our outstanding indebtedness during  interest expense associated with the decrease in debt was offset by an increase in the interest rate charged on our restructured debt 
income tax benefit 
we reported income tax expense of million for the year ended december  and approximately million for the year ended december  the tax expense was primarily due to approximately million of tax expense associated with the approximately million gain on extinguishment of debt  partially offset by approximately million of tax benefit on other operating losses 
the tax benefit in was primarily due to the reversal of the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets based on our expected ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards in the future 
discontinued operations 
in may  our board of directors approved our plan to dispose of the net assets used in the retail optical and optometry practice locations we operated in north carolina 
on august   we consummated the sale of those assets  which resulted in an approximate million loss on disposal in  including income tax expense of approximately million 
we reported approximately million of income from discontinued operations  net of tax  for each of the years ended december  and  representing income from this operation prior to disposal 
liquidity and capital resources uses of liquidity 
the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations in thousands at december  that impact our liquidity 
contractual obligations thereafter total long term debt    operating leases        capital leases total        our long term debt is explained in detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
operating leases and capital leases are explained in detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
throughout  we plan to continue making substantial investments in our business 
in that regard  we foresee the following as significant uses of liquidity in personnel costs  interest and principal expense of approximately million related to payments to be made our principal lender  capitalsource finance  llc  and capital expenditures of approximately million 
we also may make investments in future acquisitions of complementary businesses or technologies 
the amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will depend upon numerous factors  including our investments in technology  the amount of cash generated by our operations and the amount and extent of our acquisitions 
actual expenditures may vary substantially from our estimates 
sources of liquidity 
our primary sources of liquidity have been cash flows generated from operations in our managed vision and consumer vision segments and borrowings under our credit facility 
the following table sets forth a year over year comparison of the components of our liquidity and capital resources for the years ended december  and in millions change cash and cash equivalents cash used in provided by operating activities investing activities financing activities net cash used in operating activities in included a net loss from continuing operations of approximately million  which was offset by approximately million of non cash charges 
the remaining million of cash used in operating activities was a net decrease in working capital  primarily due to a reduction in accounts payable 
net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  primarily included income from continuing operations and cash provided by discontinued operations  which were offset by a reduction in accounts payable and accrued expenses as a result of our improved liquidity after our debt restructuring in january net cash used in investing activities was approximately million for the year ended december  and included approximately million of cash used to purchase the assets of wise optical in february and approximately million of capital expenditures 
net cash provided by investing activities in consisted principally of approximately million in net cash received from the sale of discontinued operations and approximately million received from notes receivable payments  which were partially offset by approximately million paid to reacquire certain notes receivable and contractual rights as part of our debt restructuring in and approximately million paid for the purchase of fixed assets 
net cash provided by financing activities was approximately million for the year ended december  and was primarily the result of an approximate million net increase in borrowings under our revolving credit facility  which was primarily used to fund the purchase of wise optical and offset wise optical s operating losses during the year 
net cash used in financing activities in of approximately million resulted primarily from our debt and equity restructure in january and included principal payments on long term debt of approximately million  a net decrease in our revolving credit facility of approximately million and financing costs of approximately million  which were partially offset by approximately million from the issuance of debt and preferred stock and approximately million in proceeds from the exercise of stock warrants 
the capitalsource loan and security agreement as of december   we had borrowings of million outstanding under our term loan with capitalsource finance  llc  million of advances outstanding under our revolving credit facility including a million temporary over advance with capitalsource and million of additional availability under our revolving credit facility 
as of february   we had repaid the million over advance and had million of advances outstanding under our revolving credit facility with capitalsource and million of additional availability 
in january  as part of a debt and equity restructuring  we entered into a credit facility with capitalsource consisting of a million term loan and a million revolving credit facility 
in february  in connection with our acquisition of wise optical  the revolving credit facility was amended to million 
although we may borrow up to million under the revolving credit facility  the maximum amount that may be advanced is limited to the value derived from applying advance rates to eligible accounts receivable and inventory 
the term loan and revolving credit facility with capitalsource are subject to a loan and security agreement 
the loan and security agreement contains certain restrictions on the conduct of our business  including  among other things  restrictions on incurring debt  purchasing or investing in the securities of  or acquiring any other interest in  all or substantially all of the assets of any person or joint venture  declaring or paying any cash dividends or making any other payment or distribution on our capital stock  and creating or suffering liens on our assets 
we are required to maintain certain financial covenants  including a minimum fixed charge ratio and to maintain a minimum net worth 
upon the occurrence of certain events or conditions described in the loan and security agreement subject to grace periods in certain cases  including our failure to meet the financial covenants  the entire outstanding balance of principal and interest would become immediately due and payable 
we did not meet our minimum fixed charge ratio covenant in the third and fourth quarter of  primarily due to operating losses incurred at wise optical 
however  on november  we entered into an amendment of the terms of our term loan and credit facility with capitalsource which  among other things  i increased our term loan by million and extend the maturity date of the term loan from january  to january   ii extended the maturity date of our revolving credit facility from january  to january   iii permanently increased the advance rate on eligible receivables of wise optical from to  iv temporarily increased the advance rate on eligible inventory of wise optical from to through march   v provided access to a million temporary over advance bearing interest at prime plus  which was repaid by march   and was guaranteed by palisade concentrated equity partnership  lp  vi through march   waived our non compliance with the minimum fixed charge ratio covenant  and vii changed our net worth covenant from million to tangible net worth of million 
in connection with the foregoing amendment  we agreed to pay capitalsource  in financing fees 
the amendment also included an additional  termination fee if we terminate the revolving credit facility prior to december  additionally  if we terminate the revolving credit facility pursuant to a refinancing with another commercial financial institution  we must pay capitalsource  in lieu of the termination fee  a yield maintenance amount equal to the difference between i the all in effective yield which could be earned on the revolving balance through january   and ii the total interest and fees actually paid to capitalsource on the revolving credit facility prior to the termination date or date of prepayment 
we did not meet our fixed charge ratio covenant in january and february  however we expect to meet all covenants in march accordingly  on march  we entered into the second amended and restated credit facility which incorporates all of the changes embodied in the above amendments and i confirmed that the temporary over advance was repaid as of february  ii changed the expiration date of the waiver of our fixed ratio covenant from march  to february  and iii reduced the tangible net worth covenant from million to million 
in connection with the third amendment  we agreed to pay  to capitalsource in financing fees 
as of march   the advance rate under our revolving credit facility was of all eligible accounts receivable and of all eligible inventory 
we are required to make monthly principal payments of  on the term loan with the balance due at maturity 
the interest rate applicable to the term loan equals the prime rate plus but not less than and the interest rate applicable to the revolving credit facility is prime rate plus but not less than 
our subsidiaries guarantee payments and other obligations under the revolving credit facility and we including certain subsidiaries have granted a first priority security interest in substantially all our assets to capitalsource 
we also pledged the capital stock of certain of our subsidiaries to capitalsource 
in september  we began implementing strategies and operational changes designed to improve the operations of wise optical 
these efforts include developing our sales force  improving customer service  enhancing productivity  eliminating positions and streamlining our warehouse and distribution processes 
we expect these changes will lead to increased sales  improved gross margins and reduced operating costs at wise optical 
in addition  in in our managed vision segment  we began shifting away from the lower margin and long sales cycle of our third party administrator tpa style business to the higher margin and shortened sales cycle of a direct to employer business 
this new direct to employer business also removes some of the volatility that is often experienced in our tpa type accounts 
during we developed the sales force and infrastructure necessary to build our direct to employer business and expect increased and profitability as a result of this product shift 
we experienced significant improvements in revenue and profitability in our consumer vision segment during  largely from growth in existing store sales and enhanced margins as a result of sales incentives  which we expect to continue in we believe the combination of the above initiatives will lead to improved liquidity in we believe that our cash flow from operations  borrowings under our amended credit facility with capitalsource and operating and capital lease financing will provide us with sufficient funds to finance our operations for the next months 
moreover  we believe that we will be able to comply with our financial covenants under our amended credit facility with capitalsource  including our minimum fixed charge ratio covenant  the waiver with respect to which expired on february  however  if operating losses continue and we fail to comply with our financial covenants in the future or otherwise default on our debt  our creditors could foreclose on our assets  in which case we would be obligated to seek alternate sources of financing 
there can be no assurance that alternate sources of financing will be available to us on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
if additional funds are needed  we may attempt to raise such funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities  the percentage ownership of our stockholders will be reduced and our stockholders may experience dilution of their interest in us 
if additional funds are needed and are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  our ability to fund our operations  take advantage of unanticipated opportunities  develop or enhance services or products or otherwise respond to competitive pressures may be significantly limited and may have a material adverse impact on the business and operations of the company 
working capital constraint and contingencies our managed vision segment maintains  of restricted investments in the form of certificates of deposit  primarily related to the operation of our south carolina captive insurance company and our texas hmo  thereby resulting in a restriction upon working capital 
of this amount   is held as collateral for letters of credit 
in november  the texas commissioner of insurance reduced the required minimum net worth for our texas hmo subsidiary from  to  which has a positive impact on our liquidity 
seasonality our revenues are generally affected by seasonal fluctuations in the consumer vision and distribution and technology segments 
during the winter and summer months  we generally experience a decrease in patient visits and product sales 
as a result  our cash  accounts receivable and revenues decline during these periods and  since we retain certain fixed costs related to staffing and facilities during these periods  our cash flows can be negatively affected 
impact of inflation and changing prices our revenue is subject to pre determined medicare reimbursement rates that  for certain products and services  have decreased over the past three years 
decreases in medicare reimbursement rates could have an adverse effect on our results of operations if we cannot offset these reductions through increases in revenues or decreases in operating costs 
to some degree  prices for health care services and products are set based upon medicare reimbursement rates  so that our non medicare business is also affected by changes in medicare reimbursement rates 
we believe that inflation has not had a material effect on our revenues during  or the conversion of our senior subordinated secured loans into series c preferred stock in january  palisade concentrated equity partnership  lp and linda yimoyines  wife of dean yimoyines  our chairman and chief executive officer made subordinated secured loans to us in the amount of million and million  respectively 
the subordinated secured loans were evidenced by senior subordinated secured notes that ranked pari passu with each other 
the notes were subordinated to our indebtedness to capitalsource and were secured by second priority security interests in substantially all of our assets 
principal was due on january  and interest was payable quarterly at the rate of 
in the first and second years  we had the right to defer and respectively  of interest to maturity by increasing the principal amount of the note by the amount of interest so deferred 
on may   palisade and ms 
yimoyines exchanged the entire amount of principal and interest due to them under the senior secured loans  totaling an aggregate of approximately million  for a total of  shares of series c preferred stock  of which  shares were issued to palisade and  shares were issued to linda yimoyines 
the aggregate principle and interest was exchanged at a rate equal to 
per share  the agreed upon value of our common stock on may   divided by or per share 
the series c preferred stock has an aggregate liquidation preference of approximately million and ranks senior to all other currently issued and outstanding classes or series of our stock with respect to liquidation rights 
each share of series c preferred stock is  at the holder s option  convertible into shares of common stock and has the same dividend rights  on an as converted basis  as our common stock 
the series b preferred stock as of december   we had  shares of series b preferred stock issued and outstanding 
subject to the senior liquidation preference of the series c preferred stock  the series b preferred stock ranks senior to all other currently issued and outstanding classes or series of our stock with respect to dividends  redemption rights and rights on liquidation  winding up  corporate reorganization and dissolution 
each share of series b preferred stock is  at the holder s option  immediately convertible into a number of shares of common stock equal to such share s current liquidation value  divided by a conversion price of  subject to adjustment for dilutive issuances 
the number of shares of common stock into which each share of series b preferred stock is convertible will increase over time because the liquidation value of the series b preferred stock increases at a rate of per year compounded annually 
each share of series b preferred stock must be redeemed in full by the company on december   at a price equal to the greater of i the aggregate adjusted redemption value of the series b preferred stock per share plus accrued but unpaid dividends or ii the amount the preferred stockholders would be entitled to receive if the series b preferred stock plus accrued dividends were converted at that time into common stock and the company were to liquidate and distribute all of its assets to its common stockholders 
the series b preferred stock accrues dividends at an annual rate of 
as of december   cumulative accrued and unpaid dividends on the series b preferred stock totaled million 
if our assets are insufficient to pay the full amount payable to the holders of the series b preferred stock with respect to dividends  redemption rights or liquidation preferences  then such holders will share ratably in the distribution of assets 
significant related party transactions we maintain a substantial number of real estate leases with various terms with related parties for properties located in connecticut and florida 
generally  the leases are for property that is used for executive offices and for the practice of ophthalmology  optometry  sale of eyeglasses or other operating and administrative functions 
we believe that these leases reflect the fair market value and contain customary terms for leased commercial real estate in the geographic area where they are located

forward looking information and risk factors the statements in this annual report on form k and elsewhere such as in other filings by the company with the securities and exchange commission  press releases  presentations by the company or its management and oral statements that relate to matters that are not historical facts are forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities exchange act of when used in this document and elsewhere  words such as anticipate  believe  expect  plan  intend  estimate  project  will  could  may  predict and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
such forward looking statements include those relating to o our opinion that with respect to lawsuits incidental to our current and former operations  after taking into account the merits of defenses and established reserves  the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations  o our belief that recent strategies implemented at wise optical will lead to increased sales  improved gross margins and reduced operating costs 
o our belief that our new direct to employer product will lead to increased revenue and gross margins in our managed vision segment 
o the expectation that the consolidation in the eye care industry will continue and could further reduce our buying group s market share and revenue  and that we do not expect this trend to have a material impact on our overall profitability  and o our belief that cash from operations  borrowings under our amended credit facility  and operating and capital lease financings will provide sufficient funds to finance operations for the next months 
in addition  such forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties  and other factors which may cause the actual results  performance or achievements of the company to be materially different from any future results expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
also  our business could be materially adversely affected and the trading price of our common stock could decline if any of the following risks and uncertainties develop into actual events 
such risk factors  uncertainties and the other factors include changes in the regulatory environment applicable to our business  including health care cost containment efforts by medicare  medicaid and other third party payers may adversely affect our profits 
the health care industry has experienced a trend toward cost containment as government and private third party payors seek to impose lower reimbursement and utilization rates and negotiate reduced payment schedules with service providers 
our revenue is subject to pre determined medicare reimbursement rates for certain products and services  and decreases in medicare reimbursement rates could have an adverse effect on our results of operations if we cannot offset these reductions through increases in revenues or decreases in operating costs 
to some degree  prices for health care services and products are driven by medicare reimbursement rates  so that our non medicare business is also affected by changes in medicare reimbursement rates 
in addition  federal and state governments are currently considering various types of health care initiatives and comprehensive revisions to the health care and health insurance systems 
some of the proposals under consideration  or others that may be introduced  could  if adopted  have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
risks related to the eye care industry  including the cost and availability of medical malpractice insurance  and possible adverse long term experience with laser and other surgical vision correction could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the provision of eye care services entails the potentially significant risk of physical injury to patients and an inherent risk of potential malpractice  product liability and other similar claims 
our insurance may not be adequate to satisfy claims or protect us and our affiliated eye care providers  and this coverage may not continue to be available at acceptable costs 
a partially or completely uninsured claim against us could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
managed care companies face increasing threats of private party litigation  including class actions  over the scope of care for which managed care companies must pay 
several large national managed care companies have been the target of class action lawsuits alleging fraudulent practices in the determination of health care coverage policies for their beneficiaries 
such lawsuits have  thus far  been aimed solely at full service managed care plans and not companies that specialize in specific segments  such as eye care 
we cannot assure you that private party litigation  including class action suits  will not target it in the future  or that we will not otherwise be affected by such litigation 
loss of the services of key management personnel could adversely affect our business 
our success  in part  depends upon the continued services of dean j 
yimoyines  md  who is our chairman and chief executive officer 
we believe that the loss of the services of dr 
yimoyines could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  we have employment agreements with dean j 
yimoyines and other officers that require lump sum payments to be made upon the event of a change in control 
these change in control payments could deter takeover bids even if those bids are in our stockholders best interests 
if we fail to execute our growth strategy  we may not become profitable our growth strategy depends in part on its ability to expand and successfully implement our integrated business model 
our growth strategy also requires successful sales results and operational execution in our managed care business 
our growth strategy has resulted in  and will continue to result in  new and increased responsibilities for management and additional demands on management  operating and financial systems and resources 
our ability to continue to expand will also depend upon our ability to hire and train new staff and managerial personnel  and adapt our structure to comply with present or future legal requirements affecting our arrangements with ophthalmologists and optometrists 
if we are unable to implement these and other requirements  our business  financial condition  results of operations and ability to achieve and sustain profitability could be materially adversely affected 
if we are unable to obtain additional capital  our growth could be limited 
if we do not generate sufficient cash from its operations  we may need to obtain additional capital in order to successfully implement our growth strategy and to finance our continued operations 
we believe that our cash flow from operations  borrowings under our credit facility  and operating and capital lease financing will provide us with sufficient funds to finance our operations for the next months 
if however  additional funds are needed  we may attempt to raise such funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities  the percentage ownership of our stockholders will be reduced and our stockholders may experience dilution of their interest in us 
if additional funds are needed and are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  our ability to fund our operations  take advantage of unanticipated opportunities  develop or enhance services or products or otherwise respond to competitive pressures may be significantly limited 
we have a history of losses and may incur further losses in the future 
we have historically incurred substantial operating losses due to our sizeable outstanding indebtedness and costs relating to the integration of newly acquired businesses 
we cannot assure that it will not incur further losses in the future 
we may not be able to maintain the listing of its common stock on the american stock exchange  which may make it more difficult for stockholders to dispose of our common stock 
our common stock is listed on the american stock exchange 
the exchange s rules for continued listing include stockholders equity requirements  which we may not meet if we experience further losses  and market value requirements  which we may not meet if the price of our common stock does not increase 
if our common stock is delisted from the american stock exchange  trading in our common stock would be conducted  if at all  in the over the counter market 
this would make it more difficult for stockholders to dispose of their common stock and more difficult to obtain accurate quotations on our common stock 
this could have an adverse effect on the price of the common stock 
if we default on our debt to capitalsource finance  llc  it could foreclose on our assets 
our outstanding indebtedness to capitalsource under its term loan and revolving credit facility as of march  was approximately million 
substantially all of opticare s assets are pledged to secure this indebtedness 
if opticare defaults on the financial covenants in its credit facility  capitalsource could foreclose on its security interest in our assets  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may not be able to compete effectively with other eye care services companies which have more resources and experience than us  and with other eye care distributors 
some of our competitors have substantially greater financial  technical  managerial  marketing and other resources and experience than we do and  as a result  may compete more effectively than we can 
we compete with other businesses  including other eye care services companies  hospitals  individual ophthalmology and optometry practices  other ambulatory surgery and laser vision correction centers  managed care companies  eye care clinics  providers of retail optical products and distributors of wholesale and retail optical products 
companies in other health care industry segments  including managers of hospital based medical specialties or large group medical practices  may become competitors in providing surgery and laser centers as well as competitive eye care related services 
our failure to compete effectively with these and other competitors  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we fail to negotiate profitable capitated fee arrangements  it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
under some managed care contracts  known as capitation contracts  health care providers accept a fixed payment per member per month  whether or not a person covered by a managed care plan receives any services  and the health care provider is obligated to provide all necessary covered services to the patients covered under the agreement 
many of these contracts pass part of the financial risk of providing care from the payor  ie  an hmo  health insurer  employee welfare plan or self insured employer  to the provider 
the growth of capitation contracts in markets which we serve could result in less certainty with respect to profitability and require a higher level of actuarial acumen in evaluating such contracts 
we do not know whether we will be able to continue to negotiate arrangements on a capitated or other risk sharing basis that prove to be profitable  or to pass the financial risks of providing care to other parties  or to accurately predict utilization or the costs of rendering services 
in addition  changes in federal or state regulations of these contracts may limit our ability to transfer financial risks away from us 
any such developments could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may have potential conflicts of interests with respect to related party transactions which could result in certain of our officers  directors and key employees having interests that differ from our stockholders and us 
we have contractual agreements with entities owned or controlled by our officers  directors and key employees  which agreements could create the potential for possible conflicts of interests for such individuals 
through our subsidiaries  we lease property owned by certain of our officers and their family members 
our subsidiary  opticare eye health centers  inc  is party to a professional services and support agreement with opticare  pc  a connecticut professional corporation 
dr 
yimoyines  our chairman  chief executive officer  and beneficial holder of approximately of our outstanding voting stock  is the sole stockholder of opticare  pc pursuant to our agreement  opticare  pc employs medical personnel and performs all ophthalmology and optometry services at our facilities in connecticut 
we select and provide the facilities at which the services are performed and provide all administrative and support services for the facilities for which opticare  pc provides medical personnel and performs its ophthalmology and optometry services 
we bill and receive payments for services rendered by the medical personnel of opticare  pc and opticare pc pays its physicians compensation for such medical services rendered 
health care regulations or health care reform initiatives could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to extensive federal and state governmental regulation and supervision  including  but not limited to o anti kickback statutes  o self referral laws  o insurance and licensor requirements associated with our managed care business  o civil false claims acts  o corporate practice of medicine restrictions  o fee splitting laws  o facility license requirements and certificates of need  o regulation of medical devices  including laser vision correction and other refractive surgery procedures  o fda and ftc guidelines for marketing laser vision correction  and o regulation of personally identifiable health information 
we cannot assure you that these laws and regulations will not change or be interpreted in the future either to restrict or adversely affect its business activities or relationships with other eye care providers 
these laws and regulations have been subject to limited judicial and regulatory interpretation 
they are enforced by regulatory agencies that are vested with broad discretion in interpreting their meaning 
neither federal nor state authorities have examined our agreements and activities with respect to these laws and regulations 
we cannot assure you that review of our business arrangements will not result in determinations that adversely affect our operations or that certain material agreements between us and eye care providers or third party payers will not be held invalid and unenforceable 
any limitation on our ability to continue operating in the manner in which we have operated in the past could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  these laws and their interpretation vary from state to state 
the regulatory framework of certain jurisdictions may limit our expansion into such jurisdictions if we are unable to modify our operational structure to conform to such regulatory framework 
we are dependent upon letters of credit or other forms of third party security in connection with certain of our contractual arrangements and  thus  would be adversely affected in the event we are unable to obtain such credit as needed 
we have obtained letters of credit to secure its contractual commitments to certain managed care companies 
if we are unable to maintain these letters of credit or secure replacement letters of credit  we may not be able to retain our existing contracts or obtain new contracts with certain managed care companies 
the inability to do business with these managed care companies could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may not realize the expected benefits from our acquisition of wise optical 
we may not be able to decrease the operating losses or profitably manage the operations of wise optical in the future without encountering difficulties or experiencing the loss of key employees  potential customers or suppliers 
if we can not profitably manage wise optical s operations  or if the effort requires greater time or resources than opticare has anticipated  we may not realize the expected benefits from the acquisition  and this could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
our largest stockholder  palisade concentrated equity partnership  lp  owns sufficient shares of our common stock and voting equivalents to significantly affect the results of any stockholder vote and controls our board of directors 
palisade owns approximately of our voting power and therefore will determine the outcome of all corporate matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election of all of our directors and transactions such as mergers 
in addition  in connection with the restructuring  we agreed that so long as palisade owns more than of the voting power of our capital stock  palisade shall have the right to designate a majority of our board of directors 
conflicts of interest may arise between palisade and opticare 
conflicts of interest may arise between us and palisade and its affiliates in areas relating to past  ongoing and future relationships and other matters 
these potential conflicts of interest include corporate opportunities  indemnity arrangements  potential acquisitions or financing transactions  sales or other dispositions by palisade of our shares held by it  and the exercise by palisade of its ability to control our management and affairs 
in addition  two of our directors are officers of palisade capital management  llc  an affiliate of palisade 
there can be no assurance that any conflicts that may arise between palisade and us will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations or our other stockholders 
we may fail financial covenants in the future in the third and fourth quarters of  we failed our fixed charges ratio covenant under our revolving credit facility with capitalsource  but received a waiver through february  if we fail a financial covenant in the future beyond the date of our current waiver or otherwise default on our debt  our creditors could foreclose on our assets 
except as required by law  we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this form k or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on our financing activities under our credit facility with capitalsource  due to its variable interest rate 
the nature and amount of our indebtedness may vary as a result of future business requirements  market conditions and other factors 
the extent of our interest rate risk is not quantifiable or predictable due to the variability of future interest rates and financing needs 
we do not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in the year  although there can be no assurances that interest rates will not significantly change 
a change in the interest rate payable by us on our variable rate debt would have increased or decreased the annual interest expense by million  assuming our borrowing level is unchanged 
we did not use derivative instruments to adjust our interest rate risk profile during the year ended december
