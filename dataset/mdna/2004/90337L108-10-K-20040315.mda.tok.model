item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
executive summary our business 
we operate outpatient physical and occupational therapy clinics that provide pre and post operative care and treatment for a variety of orthopedic related disorders and sports related injuries 
at december   we operated outpatient physical and occupational therapy clinics in states 
the average age of our clinics at december   was years 
we have developed of the clinics and acquired six 
to date  we have sold three clinics  closed facilities due to substandard clinic performance  and consolidated three clinics with other existing clinics 
in  we added new clinics and our goal is to open between and clinics in in addition to our owned clinics  we also manage physical therapy facilities for third parties  primarily physicians  with five third party facilities under management as of december  principal economic and industry wide factors affecting our business 
the following factors  among others  impact the profitability of our business and other physical and occupational therapy businesses competition 
the healthcare industry generally  and the physical and occupational therapy business in particular  is highly competitive and undergoes continual changes in the manner in which services are delivered and in which providers are selected 
our clinics compete with physical and occupational therapy departments of hospitals  physician owned therapy practices and other private therapy clinics 
healthcare regulation 
numerous federal  state and local regulations impact healthcare services such as the provision of physical and occupational therapy 
the requirement that our therapists be licensed and other regulations that impact the management of physical and occupational therapy clinics impose significant direct and indirect costs on our business 
private health plan coverage 
the profitability of our business  like all healthcare services businesses  partially depends on the level of reimbursement we receive from private health insurers for the services performed at our clinics 
physician referrals 
as a provider of physical and occupational therapy  we depend on physicians referring their patients to our clinics 
the number of referrals that our clinics receive is a function of physician awareness and the quality and reputation of our clinics 
high operating costs 
healthcare companies such as ours face significant operating costs 
the start up costs associated with opening new clinics can be high  and all clinics face significant costs associated with hiring and retaining qualified staff  renting appropriate space and purchasing supplies and equipment 
revenue generation and cost of revenue 
our clinics generate revenue by billing third party payors for services at standard rates 
these payor sources primarily consist of commercial health insurance companies  managed care programs  workers compensation plans  medicare and proceeds from personal injury lawsuits 
our costs in producing revenue include salaries and related costs associated with staffing our clinics  the cost of renting and supplying clinics and other costs  such as the acquisition or lease of therapy equipment 
in addition  we incur expenses associated with our collection efforts in respect of delinquent accounts 
material opportunities  challenges and risks 
the growth of our business depends on our ability to continue opening new clinics while sustaining the profitability of our existing clinics 
our goal for is to open between and additional clinics if we can identify appropriate geographic locations and hire qualified physical and occupational therapists to manage the clinics 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those that have a significant impact on our results of operations and financial position involving significant estimates requiring our judgment 
our critical accounting policies are revenue recognition 
we bill third party payors for services at standard rates 
net patient revenues are based on established billing rates  less allowances and discounts for patients covered by contractual programs 
payments received under these programs are based on predetermined rates and are generally less than the established billing rates of the clinics 
net patient revenues reflect reserves  evaluated monthly by management  for contractual and other adjustments agreed to or established with payors 
reimbursement for medicare beneficiaries is based upon a fee schedule published by hhs 
see our business sources of revenue in item allowance for doubtful accounts 
we review the accounts receivable aging and rely on prior experiences with particular payors at each clinic to determine an appropriate reserve for doubtful accounts 
historically  clinics that have large numbers of aged accounts generally have less favorable collection experience  and thus they require a higher allowance 
accounts that are ultimately determined to be uncollectible are written off against our bad debt allowance 
the amount of our aggregate bad debt allowance is periodically reviewed for adequacy in light of current and historical experience 
accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements  we must estimate our federal and state income tax liability  as well as assess temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items such as bad debt expense and amortization of leasehold improvements for tax and for accounting purposes 
the differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheets 
we must then assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and if not  establish a valuation allowance 
carrying value of long lived assets 
our property and equipment  intangible assets and goodwill collectively  our long lived assets comprise a significant portion of our total assets at december  and we account for our long lived assets pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 
this accounting standard requires that we periodically  and upon the occurrence of certain events  assess the recoverability of our long lived assets 
if the carrying value of our property and equipment or intangible assets exceeds their undiscounted cash flows  we are required to write the carrying value down to estimated fair value 
also  if the carrying value of our goodwill exceeds the estimated fair value  we are required to allocate the estimated fair value to our assets and liabilities  as if we had just acquired it in a business combination 
we then would write down the carrying value of our goodwill to the implied fair value 
any such write down is included as an impairment loss in our consolidated statement of operations 
judgment is required to estimate the fair value of our long lived assets 
we may use quoted market prices  prices for similar assets  present value techniques and other valuation techniques to prepare these estimates 
in addition  we may obtain independent appraisals in certain circumstances 
we may need to make estimates of future cash flows and discount rates as well as other assumptions in order to implement these valuation techniques 
accordingly  any value ultimately derived from our long lived assets may differ from our estimate of fair value 
accounting for minority interests 
in the majority of our partnership agreements  the therapist partner begins with a profit interest in his or her clinic partnership  which increases by points at the beginning of each subsequent year until his or her interest reaches 
within the balance sheet and statement of operations we record partner therapists profit interest in the clinic partnerships as minority interest in earnings of subsidiary limited partnerships 
the emerging issues task force eitf issued eitf  issues related to the accounting for stock compensation under apb no 
and fasb interpretation no   which provides specific accounting guidance relating to various incentive compensation issues 
we reviewed eitf with respect to the partnerships structure and the accounting for minority interest and concluded that for partnerships formed after january   eitf requires us to expense as compensation rather than as a minority interest in earnings  the clinic partners interest in profits 
moreover  eitf also requires  as to clinic partnerships formed after january   that we expense as compensation rather than capitalizing as goodwill  the purchase of minority interest in the partnerships 
at this time we operate wholly owned clinics without any minority interest 
due to this change in accounting practice  we have expanded the number of our wholly owned clinics 
in accordance with the above  for the years ended december  and  we have classified  and  respectively  of the minority interests in earnings of subsidiary limited partnerships relating to the partnerships formed after january   into salaries and related costs 
as of december  and december    and  respectively  in undistributed minority interests related to the partnerships is classified as other long term liabilities 
this change in classification had no effect on net income at december  but rather is a reclassification between minority interests in earnings and salaries and related costs 
no amounts were reclassified in  due to the insignificant amount of minority interest in the partnerships formed between january  and december  see minority interest a subsection of significant accounting policies note in item selected operating and financial data the following table presents selected operating and financial data 
we view these non financial data points as key indicators of our operating performance 
as indicated below  the number of daily visits to our clinics has declined from an average of per clinic during to an average of per clinic during for the years ended december  number of clinics working days average visits per day per clinic total patient visits    net patient revenue per visit statements of operations per visit net revenues salaries and related costs rent  clinic supplies and other provision for doubtful accounts contribution from clinics corporate office costs operating income results of operations fiscal year compared to fiscal year net revenues rose to million from million primarily due to an increase in patient visits to  and a increase in net patient revenues per visit to

total patient visits increased  or  to  for from  for the growth in visits for the year was attributable to an increase of  visits in clinics opened between january  and december  and  visits from clinics developed during the new clinics  offset by a  decrease in visits for clinics opened before january  we believe the decrease in visits for clinics opened before january  is primarily a result of increases in patient co payments and deductibles which has contributed to some softness in the therapy sector 
we also believe that in certain markets this decline is attributable to higher unemployment rates or increased competition levels 
net patient revenues from new clinics accounted for approximately of the increase  or approximately million 
the remaining increase of million in net patient revenues was from clinics opened prior to january  the mature clinics 
of the million increase  million related to clinics opened during  offset by a million decrease in clinics opened prior to january  in addition  of the million increase in net patient revenues from the mature clinics  million of this increase related to a increase in patient visits  while  was due to a less than increase in the average net revenue per visit

see acquisition of minority interests and significant accounting policies notes and  respectively  in item provision for income taxes the provision for federal and state income taxes increased to million for from million for  an increase of  or  which was directly related to our increase in current year income before income taxes 
during and  we provided for income taxes at an effective tax rate of and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources we believe that our business is generating enough cash flow from operating activities to allow us to meet our short term and long term cash requirements 
at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents compared to million at december  although the start up costs associated with opening new clinics  and our planned capital expenditures are significant  we believe that our cash and cash equivalents are sufficient to fund the working capital needs of our operating subsidiaries  future clinic development and investments 
included in cash and cash equivalents at december  were million in a money market fund and million in a short term debt instrument issued by an agency of the us government 
the increase in cash of million from december  to december  is due primarily to million in cash provided by operating activities  offset by cash used in financing activities of million and million in fixed asset and intangible purchases 
in  we made million in distributions to minority investors in subsidiary limited partnerships and used million and million in cash to purchase fixed assets and make leasehold improvements  respectively 
cash was provided by proceeds of million and a tax benefit of million from the exercises of stock options 
our current ratio decreased to to at december  from to at december  the decrease in the current ratio is due primarily to the reclassification of convertible subordinated notes from long term debt to current liabilities as they will become due in june  at december   we had a debt to equity ratio of to compared to to at december  the decrease in the debt to equity ratio from december  to december  resulted from the additional note payable entered into during for the acquisition of minority interest 
we have future obligations for debt repayments and future minimum rentals under operating leases 
the obligations as of december  are summarized as follows in thousands contractual obligation total thereafter notes payable   employee agreements    operating leases       total       in   of a convertible subordinated note was converted into common stock  leaving a remaining balance of million at december  and on january   an additional  of the convertible subordinated note was converted into common stock leaving a remaining balance of million 
we anticipate that the remaining million convertible subordinated note will be converted into common stock at the june maturity date 
however  if our share price is not at or above in june  it is likely that the note holders would not convert and we would have to use cash to repay the remaining series c note 
we do not currently have a credit line or other credit arrangements 
historically  we have generated sufficient cash from operations to fund our development activities and cover operational needs 
we generally develop new clinics rather than acquire them which require less capital 
we plan to continue developing new clinics and may also consider acquisitions in select markets 
we have from time to time purchased the minority interests of limited partners in our clinic partnerships 
we may purchase additional minority interests in the future 
generally  any purchases of minority interests are expected to be accomplished using a combination of cash  notes and common stock 
we believe that existing funds  supplemented by cash flows from existing operations  will be sufficient to meet our current operating needs  development plans and any purchases of minority interests through at least in september  the board of directors board authorized us to purchase  in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions  up to  shares of our common stock 
shares purchased are held as treasury shares and may be used for valid corporate purposes or retired as the board deems advisable 
during the year ended december   we purchased  shares of our common stock on the open market for million 
during january  we purchased an additional  shares of common stock on the open market for a total of  on february   our board authorized a new share repurchase program of up to  additional shares of our outstanding common stock 
as there is no specific expiration date for this board authorization  additional shares may be purchased from time to time in the open market or private transactions depending on price  availability and our cash position 
as of december   no shares have been repurchased under the new share repurchase program 
cash management we believe that our business is generating sufficient cash flow to satisfy our short term and long term cash needs  including capital expenditures needed to fund our expected growth in clinics for excess cash is invested in short term highly liquid investments  primarily money market funds and debt instruments issued by an agency of the us government

for certain redeemable financial instruments  the statement will be effective for us on january  the effective date has been deferred indefinitely for certain other types of mandatory financial instruments 
we currently do not have any financial instruments that are within the scope of this statement 
factors affecting future results clinic development as of december   we had clinics in operation  of which opened in our goal for is to open between and additional clinics if we can identify suitable geographic locations and physical and occupational therapists to manage the clinics 
we expect to incur initial operating losses from the new clinics  which will impact our operating results 
generally we experience losses during the initial period of a new clinic s operation 
operating margins for newly opened clinics tend to be lower than more seasoned clinics because of start up costs and lower patient visits and revenues 
patient visits and revenues gradually increase in the first year of operation  as patients and referral sources become aware of the new clinic 
revenues tend to increase significantly during the two to three years following the first anniversary of a clinic opening 
based on the historical performance of our new clinics  generally the clinics opened in would favorably impact our results of operations beginning in convertible subordinated debt in may we issued million of convertible subordinated notes  series c due june  the series c notes 
the series c convertible subordinated note is convertible at the option of the holder into the number of shares of our common stock determined by dividing the principal amount of the notes being converted by per share 
in june   of the series c notes were converted by the note holders into  shares of common stock 
the remaining principal amount under the series c note was million at december  and december  during january   of the series c notes was converted by the note holders into  shares of common stock leaving a remaining balance of million 
if our share price is not at or above in june  it is likely that the note holders would not convert and we would have to use cash to repay the remaining series c note 
see notes payable in note of item in  the debt conversion increased our shareholders equity by the carrying amount of the debt converted less unamortized deferred financing costs  thus improving our debt to equity ratio and favorably impacting results of operations and cash flow due to the interest savings in and before income taxes of approximately  and  respectively
