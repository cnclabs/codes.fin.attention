critical accounting policies on december   the securities and exchange commission issued release no 
 cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies 
critical accounting policies are those that involve subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates 
in response to release no 
 we reviewed our accounting policies 
the following areas require the use of judgments and estimates the valuation of long lived assets  impairment of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives  pension and postretirement benefits  income taxes  environmental and litigation accruals and revenue recognition 
estimates in each of these areas are based on historical experience and a variety of assumptions that we believe are appropriate 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
valuation of long lived assets we review our long lived assets for impairment  including property  plant and equipment  and identifiable intangibles with definite lives  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable 
to determine recoverability of our long lived assets  we evaluate the probability that future undiscounted net cash flows will be greater than the carrying amount of our assets 
impairment is measured based on the difference between the carrying amount of our assets and their estimated fair value 
impairment of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite lives are not amortized 
instead of amortizing goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite life  these assets are tested for impairment annually  or immediately if conditions indicate that such an impairment could exist 
pension and postretirement benefits we have defined benefit pension plans covering certain of our employees 
our funding policy is to make the minimum annual contribution required by the employee retirement income security act of or local statutory law 
the accumulated benefit obligation for pensions and postretirement benefits was determined using a discount rate of at september  and  and an estimated return on plan assets of at september  and the effect of any change in these assumptions may result in a large change to the accumulated benefit obligation 
assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for health care plans 
for measurement purposes  in  we assumed a annual rate of increase in the cost per capita of claims covered under health care benefits 
beginning in  the trend rate is assumed to decrease each year by to a rate of in and remain at that level thereafter 
deferred and noncurrent income taxes deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
all of our deferred tax assets were fully reserved at september  and september environmental matters our current and prior operations are subject to stringent government imposed environmental laws and regulations concerning  among other things  the discharge of materials into the environment and the generation  handling  storage  transportation and disposal of waste and hazardous materials 
to date  such laws and regulations have not had a material effect on our financial condition  results of operations  or net cash flows  although we have expended  and can be expected to expend in the future  significant amounts for the investigation of environmental conditions and installation of environmental control facilities  remediation of environmental conditions and other similar matters 
in connection with our plans to dispose of certain real estate  we must investigate environmental conditions and we may be required to take certain corrective action prior or pursuant to any such disposition 
in addition  we have identified several areas of potential contamination related to other facilities owned  or previously owned  by us  which may require us either to take corrective action or to contribute to a clean up 
we are also a defendant in several lawsuits and proceedings seeking to require us to pay for investigation or remediation of environmental matters  and for injuries to persons or property allegedly caused thereby  and we have been alleged to be a potentially responsible party at various superfund sites 
at least once each calendar quarter  we thoroughly review our environmental matters and adjust our accrual to equal the estimated probable amount that it will cost us in connection with these matters 
we believe that we have recorded adequate accruals in our consolidated financial statements to complete such investigation and take any necessary corrective actions or make any necessary contributions or other payments 
no amounts have been recorded as due from third parties  including insurers  or set off against  any environmental liability  unless such parties are contractually obligated to contribute and are not disputing such liability 
legal matters we are involved in various other claims and lawsuits incidental to our business 
we  either on our own or through our insurance carriers  are contesting these matters 
at the end of each calendar quarter  we thoroughly review our legal matters and adjust our accrual to equal the estimated probable amount that it will cost us in connection with these matters 
in the opinion of management  the ultimate resolution of the legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  future results of operations  or net cash flows 
revenue recognition revenues are recognized immediately upon the sale of merchandise by our retail stores 
sales and related costs are recognized on shipment of products and or performance of services  when collection is probable 
lease and rental revenue are recognized on a straight line basis over the life of the lease 
shipping and handling amounts billed to customers are classified as revenues

also on november   we acquired for million million from the administrator for eurobike ag and from two subsidiaries of eurobike ag all of their respective ownership interests in poloexpress and receivables owed to them by poloexpress 
we used available cash from investments that were sold to pay the administrator million million on november  and borrowed million million from the administrator at a rate of  per annum 
on may  we received financing from two german banks and paid the note due to the administrator 
the aggregate purchase price for these acquisitions was approximately million million  including million million of cash acquired 
on january   we acquired for million million all but of the interest owned by mr 
klaus esser in poloexpress 
mr 
esser will retain a ownership interest in poloexpress  but fairchild has a right to call this interest at any time from march to october  for a fixed purchase price of million million at september  
mr

on january   we used available cash to pay mr 
esser million million and provided collateral of million million to a german bank to issue a guarantee to mr 
esser to secure the price for the put mr 
esser has a right to exercise in april of the transaction includes an agreement with mr 
esser under which he agrees with us not to compete with poloexpress for five years 
we also signed an employment agreement with mr 
esser for two years 
as of september   the million million collateralized obligation for the put option was recorded in other long term liabilities and the restricted cash is invested in a capital protected investment and money market funds and included in long term investments 
the total purchase price exceeded the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired by approximately million 
the excess of the purchase price over tangible assets was allocated to identifiable intangible assets  including brand names hein gericke and polo  and are reflected in goodwill and intangible assets in the consolidated financial statements as of september  in  we recognized amortization expense of associated with million of intangible assets determined to have a definite life 
since their acquisition on november   we have consolidated the results of hein gericke  poloexpress and ifw into our financial statements 
on may   our german subsidiary  hein gericke deutschland gmbh and the german partnership which owns poloexpress  obtained financing of million million from stadtsparkasse d sseldorf and hsbc trinkaus burkhardt kgaa 
the loan agreements require hein gericke and poloexpress to maintain compliance with certain covenants 
the most restrictive of the covenants requires hein gericke to maintain equity of million  as defined in the loan contracts 
no dividends may be paid by hein gericke unless such covenants are met and dividends may be paid only up to consolidated after tax profits 
the proceeds from the financing were used to pay the balance of the purchase price owed to the administrator for eurobike ag  and complete our acquisition of hein gericke  poloexpress  and ifw 
in addition  hein gericke also borrowed million million from our subsidiary  fairchild holding corp  which may be repaid only if the covenants in the loan agreements are met 
the loan agreements restrict all other forms of cash flows from these subsidiaries to the parent 
at september   we were in compliance with the loan covenants on december   we completed the sale of our fastener business to alcoa inc for approximately million in cash and the assumption of certain liabilities 
the cash received from alcoa is subject to a post closing balance sheet adjustment based upon the net working capital of the fastener business on december   compared with its net working capital as of march  during the four year period from to  we are entitled to receive additional cash proceeds of million for each commercial aircraft delivered by boeing and airbus in excess of threshold levels  up to a maximum of million per year 
the thresholds for aircraft delivery are in  in  in  and in based upon the greenslet report included in the airline monitor issued on february   commercial aircraft were delivered by boeing and airbus in calendar these deliveries exceeded the target threshold for aircraft deliveries of commercial aircraft in accordingly  we earned million of additional proceeds from alcoa and we have recognized this amount as a gain on disposal of discontinued operations in from this amount  we reimbursed alcoa approximately million for taxes alcoa had paid that were attributable to periods prior to december  the date of the sale  million to settle alcoa s claims with respect to uncollected accounts receivable  and agreed to split equally a million claim alcoa had made with respect to bonus payments of certain foreign employees of the business alcoa acquired from the company 
the taxes were primarily property taxes and non income taxes paid after december  in foreign countries for periods prior to the date of sale 
there were accounts receivable on the closing date balance sheet at the date of the sale to alcoa 
alcoa had the right to require us to repurchase any of these accounts receivable which were uncollected by alcoa as of june  six months after the date of sale 
in  we paid alcoa million to settle its claims arising from these uncollected receivables 
since that time  several of the account debtors have made payments to alcoa  and in july  alcoa reimbursed us million for these accounts receivable it collected through march  we have also collected an additional million of these accounts receivable 
as a result of the aircraft delivery earn out  offset partially by the settlement for taxes  accounts receivable  former employee bonus payments  and other items  we recorded a million gain on disposal of discontinued operations for alcoa  without our authorization  held back in escrow million  which alcoa agreed was due to the company  pending resolution of the post closing balance sheet adjustment dispute 
there is no provision in the agreements between the company and alcoa permitting alcoa to create an escrow for the disputed post closing balance sheet adjustment 
we have notified alcoa of our dispute of these matters and claims  and expect that resolution will require litigation  arbitration  or alternative dispute resolution methods 
at september   we had not recorded an accrual for these disputes with alcoa 
the sale of the fastener business has reduced our dependence upon the aerospace industry 
in fiscal  we used a portion of the proceeds from the sale to repay our bank debt and to acquire by tender all of our outstanding million senior subordinated notes due in april we used a portion of the remaining proceeds to fund the acquisition of hein gericke  poloexpress  and ifw 
in february  our board of directors adopted a formal plan for the sale of aps  a small operation in our aerospace manufacturing segment  which has been unprofitable 
on january   we consummated a sale of substantially all of the physical assets of aps for a nominal amount 
accordingly  the results of aps were reported as a discontinued operation 
a settlement has been signed with gulfstream  which was a large customer of aps  under which approximately million was paid to us 
consolidated results because of the november  acquisition of hein gericke  poloexpress  and ifw  collectively now known as fairchild sports  and the sale of the fasteners business on december   the discussion below can not be relied upon as a trend of our future results 
additionally  fairchild sports is a highly seasonal business  with a historic trend of a higher volume of sales and profits during the months of march through september 
we currently report in three principal business segments sports leisure  aerospace  and real estate operations 
the following table provides the sales and operating income of our segments on a historical and pro forma basis for the year ended september   the three month transition period ended september   and the years ended june  and june   respectively 
the pro forma results represent the impact of our acquisition of hein gericke  poloexpress  and ifw  as if this transaction had occurred at the beginning of each of our fiscal periods

revenues of million in  decreased by million  or  compared to revenues of million in fiscal in fiscal and fiscal  the aerospace industry was adversely affected following the attacks of september   and weakness in the overall economy 
during this period  reduction in travel and financial difficulties of major commercial airlines affected the demand for products we sell at our aerospace businesses 
gross margin as a percentage of sales was    and in fiscal  the three month transition period ended september   fiscal  and fiscal  respectively 
the improvement in margins reflects the higher gross margins earned from retail sales at the sports leisure segment  which was acquired on november  gross margin as a percentage of rental revenue at our real estate segment was    and in fiscal  the three month transition period ended september   fiscal  and fiscal  respectively

other income increased million in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  due primarily other income recognized at our sports leisure segment from shop partner reimbursements of costs 
other income decreased million in fiscal  as compared to fiscal this change primarily reflects income recognized in from the disposition of future royalty revenues to an unaffiliated third party in exchange for million of promissory notes  offset partially by million of income recognized in from the sale of non core property 
impairment charges of million  million  and million were recognized in  and  respectively 
the fiscal results include impairment expenses of million to write down the value of a landfill development partnership  in which we are a limited partner and were required to consolidate in accordance with fasb interpretation r beginning january  the fiscal impairment charges included million to write down goodwill at our aerospace distribution segment and a million write down of intangible assets of a start up company in our corporate and other segment

restructuring charges of million in included the costs to close all fifteen of the goto helmstudio retail locations in germany 
all of the charges were the direct result of activities that occurred as of june  the restructuring charges included an accrual of for the remaining lease costs of the closed stores  for the write off of store fittings and for severance 
these costs were classified as restructuring and were the direct result of a formal plan to close the goto helmstudio locations and terminate its employees 
such costs are nonrecurring in nature 
other than a reduction in our existing cost structure  none of the restructuring costs will result in future increases in earnings or represent an accrual of future costs of our ongoing business 
operating loss for was million  as compared to the operating loss of million in operating loss for  includes the million of one time change of control payments required under contracts with our top four executives as a result of the sale of the fastener business  and million of bonuses awarded to our top four executives as a result of the sale of the fasteners business

net interest expense was million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the results for included interest expense  prior to the repayment of all of our then outstanding senior subordinated notes  term loan and revolving credit facilities

the results for included an expense of million to write off deferred loan fees due to the repayment of all our outstanding senior subordinated notes and our term loan and revolving credit facilities  offset partially by million of interest income recognized from the acceleration of principal on the repayment of notes due to us from an unaffiliated third party 
investment income was million in  including million of dividends and million of gains realized from the sale of investments  partially offset by million from the decline in fair market value of trading securities

the fair market value adjustment of our position in a ten year million interest rate contract increased by million in fiscal and million in the three month transition period ended september  the fair market value adjustment of our position in this interest rate contract decreased by million in fiscal and million in fiscal the fair market value adjustment of this agreement will generally fluctuate  based on the implied forward interest rate curve for month libor 
if the implied forward interest rate curve decreases  the fair market value of the interest rate contract will increase and we will record an additional charge 
if the implied forward interest rate curve increases  the fair market value of the interest rate contract will decrease  and we will record income 
increasing interest rates have caused the recent change in fair market value of the contract 
in we recorded a federal income tax benefit of million million in continuing operations and million in discontinued operations which results from two items 
the first is the tax effect from the carryback of net operating losses of million arising from the periods july  to september  and october  to september  which reduce the noncurrent income tax liability of million at june  the second is the million favorable resolution of the tax audit of kaynar technologies  inc for its final year ended april  and our tax year ended june  we recorded an income tax provision of million in fiscal on pre tax losses from continuing operations 
a tax provision was recorded due primarily from state income taxes 
we recorded an income tax benefit of million in fiscal  representing a effective tax rate benefit on pre tax losses from continuing operations 
the tax benefit resulted primarily from the reversal of tax accruals no longer required  and was lower than the statutory rate due primarily to federal income tax net operating loss carryforwards  which we had at june  earnings loss from discontinued operations includes the results of the fasteners business prior to its sale  aps prior to its sale  and certain legal and environmental expenses associated with our former businesses 
the loss from discontinued operations for fiscal consists primarily of an accrual of million of environmental liabilities at locations of operations previously sold  and million to cover legal expenses associated with a business we sold several years ago 
the increase in our environmental accrual is primarily the result of a recent sampling of groundwater from the extraction wells to be used in the remediation system at a site in farmingdale  new york  indicating contaminant levels at the extraction point that are significantly higher than previous sampling results indicated 
as a result  the cost to treat groundwater at that location is now estimated to be significantly higher 
the earnings from discontinued operations reflect our ownership of the fastener business during the first five months of fiscal  prior to its sale on december  as compared to the full year in in  we recorded a million gain on the disposal of discontinued operations  as a result of additional proceeds earned from the sale of the fastener business 
in  we recorded a million gain on the disposal of discontinued operations  net of million of taxes  as a result of the sale of the fastener business 
in  we recorded a million gain from the cumulative effect of change in accounting for an investment in affiliate 
in january  our position in a small start up business was diluted and could no longer be consolidated by us 
we were previously required to consolidate the start up business  and through december  we recognized losses of million in excess of our investment 
the negative book value was reversed in the current quarter 
in  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million from the implementation of sfas no 
 presented as a cumulative effect of change in accounting  as of the beginning of our fiscal year 
of this amount  million relates to our fairchild aerostructures operating unit in our aerospace manufacturing segment  and million relates to our fastener business sold to alcoa on december  no tax effect was recognized on the change in accounting for goodwill 
instead of amortizing goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite life  goodwill is now tested for impairment annually  or immediately if conditions indicate that such an impairment could exist 
as a result of adopting sfas no 
 we ceased amortizing goodwill at the beginning of included in our operating results was million of goodwill impairment at our aerospace distribution segment in other comprehensive income includes foreign currency translation adjustments  unrecognized actuarial loss on pensions  and unrealized periodic holding changes in the fair market value of available for sale investment securities 
in  an million increase in the minimum pension liability was offset by a million increase in the fair market value of available for sale securities and a million improvement in unrealized foreign currency translations due the strengthening of the euro to the us dollar 
in  other comprehensive income included a decrease of million due to the recognition of an additional minimum pension liability due primarily to unrecognized actuarial losses  offset partially by an increase of million in foreign currency translation adjustments which were realized as part of the sale of our fasteners business and a million increase in the fair market value of unrealized holding gains on investment securities 
the fair market value of available for sale securities  on an after tax basis  declined by million in foreign currency translation adjustments improved by million in  which reflected the strengthening of the euro to the us dollar

the fairchild sports group is a seasonal business  with an historic trend of a higher volume of sales and profits during the months of march through september 
on a pro forma basis  sales in our sports leisure segment decreased by million in  as compared to the decrease in the current year was due primarily to the closing of low performing stores in on a pro forma basis  operating income in our sports leisure segment increased by million in  as compared to operating income improved due primarily to staff efficiencies realized at the acquisition date and reductions in rent expense  offset partially by million of severance costs and million of restructuring charges recognized in since the november  acquisition  hein gericke has initiated steps to advance its retail business in germany

our principal cash requirements include supporting our current operations and general administrative structure  capital expenditures  and the payment of other liabilities including postretirement benefits  environmental investigation and remediation obligations  and litigation settlements and related costs 
we expect that cash on hand  cash generated from operations  cash available from borrowings  and proceeds received from dispositions of assets  including investments  will be adequate to satisfy our cash requirements during the next twelve months 
on september   our foreign operations had cash of million 
however  debt agreements in place at our foreign locations restrict the amount of cash that can be transferred to our other subsidiaries 
we may consider raising cash to meet the needs of our operations by issuing additional stock or debt  entering into partnership arrangements  liquidating non essential assets or other means 
we have had discussions with a lender to receive a million seasonal line of credit for our sports leisure segment  at interest rates currently approximating 
if we are unable to raise additional cash through the seasonal line of credit  which we are negotiating  we may not have sufficient liquidity during the seasonal trough to support both our operations and our corporate needs 
if this were to occur during the seasonal trough  we believe we could generate sufficient additional cash through the sale of non core assets  including investments  to satisfy our cash requirements  recognizing  however  that there are impediments to the timely disposition of non core assets  which could adversely affect realization of their fair values 
because of the seasonal trough  we may also be required to reduce corporate expenses  however  such reductions may affect our efficiency 
since december   we have been restricted from raising additional capital though the public markets  and prohibited from granting stock options  due to our inability to provide one year of audited financial statements of the companies we acquired on november   collectively now known as fairchild sports see item b  other information  for additional detail 
immediately after the filing of this annual report  we will ask the securities and exchange commission to consider accepting our audited financial statements  which includes eleven months of results from the acquired businesses  to satisfy our requirement under item  of regulation s x 
if our request is approved we will then again be able to grant stock options and make public offerings 
the costs of being a small to mid sized public company have increased substantially with the introduction of sarbanes oxley act 
audit fees and audit related fees have doubled in fiscal the increased costs include the effects of acquisitions and additional costs related to compliance with various financing agreements 
we expect the costs to comply with sarbanes oxley section alone will double the audit and audit related costs again 
we estimate that we will incur expenses of million in relation to audit fees in fiscal  excluding the internal cost and diversion of focus away from operating the business 
our audit fee in was approximately million 
this is a significant increase for a company of our size to bear 
we may consider opportunities to take our company private in the coming year 
off balance sheet items on september   approximately million of bank loans received by retail shop partners in the sports leisure segment were guaranteed by our subsidiaries and are not reflected on our balance sheet because these loans have not been assumed by us 
contractual obligations at september   we had contractual commitments to repay debt including capital lease obligations  and to make payments under operating leases 
payments due under these long term obligations are as follows thereafter total long term debt and capital lease obligations   operating lease commitments     total contractual cash obligations    we have entered into standby letter of credit arrangements with insurance companies and others  issued primarily to guarantee our future performance of contracts 
at september   we had contingent liabilities of million on commitments related to outstanding letters of credit 
on september   we have reflected a million obligation due under a ten year million interest rate swap agreement which expires on february  interest on the swap agreement is settled quarterly 
prior to the sale of our fastener business  the pension benefit guaranty corporation had contacted us to understand the impact of the sale of our fasteners business on our ability to fund our long term pension obligations 
the pbgc expressed concern that our retirement plan would be underfunded by million after the sale of our fasteners business 
we provided the pbgc with information  which represented the underfunding to be million  using the pbgc plan termination assumptions 
during  we contributed million of cash to fund this pension plan 
based upon our actuary s recent assumptions and projections  we do not expect additional cash contributions to this pension plan to be required until in addition  we have million classified as other long term liabilities at september   including million due to purchase the remaining interest in poloexpress in april the remaining million of other long term liabilities include environmental and other liabilities  which do not have specific payment terms or other similar contractual arrangements 
at september   we have million of federal income tax loss carryforwards expiring through  and million of unused alternative minimum tax credit carryforward that does not expire 
these federal income tax loss carryforwards may be reduced by adjustments during the income tax audits of to or to  which have not been completed 
as the periods of assessment for to have expired  additional tax may be collected from us only for to nonetheless  the tax losses of million arising in    and may still be reduced for determining the proper amount of net operating loss available to be carried forward to years after the gain we reported between to  for federal income tax  may be significantly increased if our tax positions are not sustained with respect to the sales of several businesses  and the repayment with property  of debt under a bank credit agreement in which both we and our subsidiaries were liable  is not treated as tax free under section of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
if all of these adjustments were made for to  the federal income tax loss carryforwards would be substantially reduced  and we may be required to pay additional tax and interest of up to million  which has already been provided 
the amount of additional tax and interest to be paid by the company depends on the amount of income tax audit adjustments  which are made and sustained for to these adjustments  if any  would be made at a future date  which is presently uncertain  and therefore we cannot predict the timing of cash outflows 
to the extent a favorable final determination of the recorded tax liabilities occurs  appropriate adjustments will be made to decrease the recorded tax liability in the year such favorable determination will occur 
we recorded a federal income tax benefit of million in which results from two items 
the first is the carryback of net operating losses arising from july  to september  and october  to september  which reduce the noncurrent income tax liability of million at june  the second is the favorable resolution of the tax audit of kaynar technologies  inc for its final year ended april  and for our year ended june  we have a million non current income tax liability at september   which includes the tax effects of net operating loss carryforwards  temporary differences  and permanent differences 
it is presently uncertain when a final determination will occur since no internal revenue service audits of to or to have been completed 
should any of these liabilities become immediately due  we would be obligated to obtain financing  raise capital  and or liquidate assets to satisfy our obligations 
recently issued accounting pronouncements on march   we adopted fasb interpretation consolidation of variable interest entities 
fasb interpretation  as revised  requires that variable interest entities created before december  be consolidated during the first interim period beginning after december  accordingly  we consolidated our interest in a landfill development partnership  of which we are a limited partner 
the consolidation of the landfill development partnership had an effect of increasing fixed assets by million after we recognized an impairment expense of million in in january  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits  an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and the statement revises employers disclosures about pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in fiscal  we entered into a ten year interest rate swap agreement to reduce our cash flow exposure to increases in interest rates on variable rate debt 
the ten year interest rate swap agreement provided us with interest rate protection on million of variable rate debt  with interest being calculated based on a fixed libor rate of to february  the variable rate debt that was fixed by the interest rate swap was repaid by us on december  on february   the bank  with which we entered into the interest rate swap agreement  did not exercise a one time option to cancel the agreement  and accordingly the transaction proceeds  based on a fixed libor rate of from february  to february  we have recognized a million non cash increase in the fair market value of the interest rate contract in fiscal as a result of the fair market value adjustment for our interest rate swap agreement 
the fair market value adjustment of these agreements will generally fluctuate based on the implied forward interest rate curve for month libor 
if the implied forward interest rate curve decreases  the fair market value of the interest hedge contract will increase and we will record an additional charge 
if the implied forward interest rate curve increases  the fair market value of the interest hedge contract will decrease  and we will record income 
in may  we issued a floating rate note with a principal amount of million 
embedded within the promissory note agreement is an interest rate cap protecting one half of the million borrowed 
the embedded interest rate cap limits to  the month euribor interest rate that we must pay on the promissory note 
we paid approximately million to purchase the interest rate cap 
in accordance with sfas  the embedded interest rate cap is considered to be clearly and closely related to the debt of the host contract and is not required to be separated and accounted for separately from the host contract 
we are accounting for the hybrid contract  comprised of the variable rate note and the embedded interest rate cap  as a single debt instrument
