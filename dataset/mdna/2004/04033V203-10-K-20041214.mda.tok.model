overview of our business ariba provides spend management solutions that allow enterprises to efficiently manage the purchasing of non payroll goods and services required to run their business 
we refer to these non payroll expenses as spend 
our solutions  which include software applications  services and network access  are designed to provide enterprises with technology and business process improvements to better manage their spending and  in turn  save money 
our software applications and services streamline and improve the business processes related to the identification of suppliers of goods and services  the negotiation of the terms of purchases  and ultimately the management of ongoing purchasing and settlement activities 
these goods and services include commodities  raw materials  operating resources  services  temporary labor  travel and maintenance  repair and operations equipment 
our software applications were built to leverage the internet and provide enterprises with real time access to their business data and their business partners 
they are designed to integrate with all major platforms and can be accessed via a web browser 
in addition to application software  ariba spend management solutions include implementation and strategic consulting services  education and training  commodity expertise and decision support services  benchmarking services  low cost country sourcing and procurement outsourcing services 
ariba spend management solutions also integrate with and leverage the ariba supplier network 
the ariba supplier network is a scalable internet infrastructure that connects our customers with their business partners and suppliers to exchange product and service information as well as a broad range of business documents  such as purchase orders and invoices 
over  suppliers  offering a wide array of goods and services  are connected to the ariba supplier network 
ariba spend management solutions are organized around six key areas of spend management  allowing organizations to take a step by step approach with technology and services that work together 
through its solution offerings  ariba helps customers to develop a strategy for spend management  aggregate spend data and gain visibility into current spending and opportunities for savings  develop sustainable sourcing 
table of contents savings and competencies  automate procurement  establish best practices and drive compliance  manage global connectivity and supplier performance  and outsource certain spend management processes or entire functions 
business model ariba spend management solutions are delivered in a flexible manner  depending upon the needs and preferences of the customer 
for customers seeking self sufficiency  we offer flexible  highly configurable and easy to use technology and related services that can be deployed behind the firewall or delivered as a hosted service 
for customers seeking expert assistance  we offer sourcing process and commodity expertise in over categories of spend 
finally  for those customers seeking managed services  we offer tailored solutions to outsource processes  spend categories  or entire procurement operations 
we have aligned our business model with the way we believe customers want to purchase and deploy spend management solutions 
customers may generally subscribe to our software products and services for a specified term  purchase a perpetual software license and or pay for services on a time and materials basis  depending upon their business requirements 
our revenue is comprised of license fees  subscription and maintenance fees  and services and other fees 
license revenue consists of fees charged for the use of our software products under perpetual or term agreements 
subscription and maintenance revenue consists of fees charged for hosted software solutions  fees for product updates and product support  and fees paid by suppliers for access to the ariba supplier network 
services and other revenue consists of fees for implementation services  consulting services  managed services  training  education  premium support and other miscellaneous items  which are more fully described in business ariba solutions delivery 
due to the different treatment of our revenue streams under applicable accounting guidance  each type of revenue has a different impact on our consolidated financial statements 
the majority of our license fees are from perpetual software license sales 
revenue from these license sales is typically recognized in the quarter that the software is delivered 
individual software license sales can be significant greater than million and sales cycles are often lengthy and difficult to predict 
as such  the timing of a few large software license transactions or the recognition of license revenue from these transactions can substantially affect our quarterly operating results 
by contrast  subscription fees for hosted software solutions are generally fixed for a specific period of time  and revenue is recognized ratably over the term 
therefore  a subscription license will result in significantly lower current period revenue than an equal sized perpetual license  but with higher revenue recognized in future periods 
similarly  maintenance fees are generally fixed for a specific period of time  and revenue is recognized ratably over the maintenance term 
maintenance contracts are typically entered into when new software licenses are purchased  at a percentage of the software license fee 
in addition  most of our customers renew their maintenance contracts annually to continue receiving product updates and product support 
given the ratable revenue recognition and historically high renewal rates of our subscription and maintenance agreements  this revenue stream has generally been more stable in the past 
finally  service revenues are driven by a contract  project or statement of work  in which the fees may be fixed for specific services to be provided over time or billed on a time and materials basis 
like subscription and maintenance fees  service fees have been more stable in the past as revenue has been recognized over the course of the fixed time or project period 
these different revenue streams also carry different gross margins 
revenue from license fees tends to be high margin revenue  and gross margins are often greater than 
revenue from subscription and maintenance fees also tends to be higher margin revenue  but not quite as high as license fees  with gross margins typically in the to range 
license  subscription and maintenance fees are generally based on software products developed by us  which carry minimal marginal cost to reproduce and sell 
revenue from labor intensive services and other fees tends to be lower margin revenue  with gross margins typically in the to range 
our overall gross margins could fluctuate from period to period depending upon the mix of revenue 
for example  a period with a higher mix of license revenue versus services revenue would drive overall gross margin higher and vice versa 

table of contents overview of fiscal year introduction several major factors had a significant impact on our business during fiscal year most notably  our acquisitions of alliente and softface in the first half of fiscal year  as well as our merger with freemarkets on july   added to our software and services capabilities and increased our revenues 
we also experienced organic growth in our services revenues  as our business model continues to shift from software sales to providing comprehensive solutions including both software applications and strategic services 
partially offsetting these positive factors were the falloff in revenue from our strategic relationship with softbank and the continued difficult selling environment for enterprise software applications 
in summary  these and other factors caused our revenues to increase by in fiscal year to million 
more specifically  license revenues of million were down as compared to fiscal year  primarily due to the significant drop off in revenue from softbank and the difficult selling environment  particularly for large enterprise software deals 
further  while we experienced some improvement in new business activity during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  it was not enough to offset the prevailing trends for much of the year 
subscription and maintenance revenues of million were up as compared to fiscal year  primarily due to the addition of software subscription revenues from freemarkets  while maintenance revenues were relatively flat 
finally  services and other revenues of million were up as compared to fiscal year  primarily due to the addition of service revenues from alliente and freemarkets and also due to organic growth of the ariba services organization 
as a result of these trends  we experienced a significant shift in our revenue mix  with license revenues contributing of total revenues as compared to in fiscal year  subscription and maintenance revenues contributing of total revenues as compared to in fiscal year  and services and other revenues contributing of total revenues as compared to in fiscal year since the cost of software license revenues is typically much lower than the cost of services revenues  the shift in our revenue mix caused our gross margin for the year to decline to as compared to for fiscal year operating expenses declined significantly to million as compared to million in fiscal year the reduction in operating expenses can primarily be attributed to the substantial decline in amortization expense for other intangible assets 
however  our sales and marketing and research and development expenses increased from last year  due to the additional operating infrastructure from alliente  softface and freemarkets 
our general and administrative expenses declined from last year primarily due to a decline in expenses related to our accounting review 
the decline in operating expenses helped drive our net loss for fiscal year down to million as compared to a net loss of million for fiscal year settlement of dispute with softbank in june  we commenced an arbitration proceeding in san francisco  california relating to our strategic relationship with softbank in japan and korea 
pursuant to the arbitration proceeding  softbank made three interim payments totaling million from october through april these funds were recorded in the period received as an increase to restricted cash and accrued liabilities 
on october   we entered into a definitive agreement with softbank settling our dispute 
under the terms of the agreement  we acquired softbank s interest in our japanese subsidiary and its interest in our korean subsidiary for million and returned to softbank million of disputed interim payments made by softbank pursuant to the arbitration proceeding 
in addition  softbank purchased a new three year term license for certain ariba software products for use by softbank and its affiliates for their own benefit and for the benefit of unaffiliated third party customers in japan 
as a result of the settlement  our total restricted cash decreased by million  but our total cash and cash equivalents increased by million 
the settlement agreement will result in the elimination of minority interests of approximately million and an additional aggregate benefit 
table of contents over the term of the arrangement to us of approximately million 
we have not yet determined the accounting treatment of our settlement with softbank but we will make a one time provision for taxes of million in the first quarter of fiscal year as a result of the settlement 
we do not have similar long term revenue commitments with any other customer 
accordingly  we do not believe that the factors giving rise to the dispute  which are unique to the softbank relationship  are likely to affect anticipated revenues from other customers 
outlook for fiscal year as a result of our recent merger with freemarkets  we expect total revenues and expenses to increase significantly during fiscal year relative to our recently reported fiscal year 
in addition  we expect to incur additional expenses related to the merger over the next few quarters  including restructuring and severance payments and the amortization of acquired other intangible assets 
our merger with freemarkets and our related restructuring program are designed to yield better operating results in fiscal year and beyond 
more specifically  we believe there are opportunities to generate ongoing cost reductions through identified cost synergies and to increase our quarterly revenues through cross selling efforts 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the first full quarter after our merger with freemarkets  we were able to reduce expenses faster than anticipated and capitalized on several cross selling opportunities 
we believe that our success in fiscal year will largely depend on our ability to continue to capitalize on the cost synergies and the cross selling opportunities from our merger with freemarkets  the overall market acceptance of our spend management solutions  and the development of new revenue streams  such as procurement outsourcing  low cost country sourcing services and fees from the ariba supplier network 
we believe that key risks to our future revenues include our ability to realize our cross selling objectives  our ability to renew ratable revenue streams  including subscription software  software maintenance and subscription services  our ability to generate organic growth  including our success in growing our sales channels in europe and japan  the market acceptance of spend management solutions as a standalone market category  the overall level of information technology spending  and potential declines in average selling prices 
we believe that key risks to our future operating profitability include our ability to maintain or grow our revenues  a shift in our mix of revenues from license fees to services and other fees  our success in integrating our recent business combinations  particularly our merger with freemarkets  our ability to maintain utilization of our services organization  particularly our global sourcing organization  and the potential adverse impacts resulting from legal proceedings or settlement costs 
our prospects must be considered in light of the risks encountered by companies at a relatively early stage of development  particularly given that we operate in new and rapidly evolving markets  have completed several acquisitions and face an uncertain economic environment 
we may not be successful in addressing such risks and difficulties

table of contents comparison of the fiscal years ended september   and revenues please refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements and application of critical accounting policies and estimates below for a description of our accounting policy related to revenue recognition 
the results of operations for the fiscal year ended september  include the effects of our merger with freemarkets for the fourth quarter of that year 
license license revenues for the year ended september  were million  a decrease from license revenues of million for the year ended september  this decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease of million in the recognition of previously deferred license revenues in the year ended september  compared to the year ended september  and a decline of million in license revenues from our softbank relationship in the year ended september  compared to the year ended september  we anticipate that license revenues for the year ended september  will increase compared to those for the year ended september  license revenues for the year ended september  represented a increase from license revenues of million for the year ended september  the increase was primarily attributable to the timing of revenue recognition of certain large contracts  an expansion of our customer base in our domestic operations  new product introductions and revenue recognized from softbank as discussed below 
we recognized license revenues of million  million and million for the years ended september   and  respectively  from softbank  a related party  pursuant to a long term revenue commitment 
these amounts represented  and of license revenues for the years ended september   and  respectively 
the increase in license revenues from softbank from fiscal year to fiscal year resulted from increasing contractual revenue commitments from softbank during that timeframe 
revenues under our agreement with softbank were recognized based on the lower of cumulative ratable revenue or cumulative cash received 
see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in addition  pursuant to our settlement with softbank  softbank purchased a new three year term license for certain ariba software products for use by softbank and its affiliates  for their own benefit and for the benefit of unaffiliated third party customers in japan 
we have not yet determined the accounting treatment of our settlement with softbank but we will make a one time provision for taxes of million in the first quarter of fiscal year as a result of the settlement 
see overview of fiscal year settlement of dispute with softbank 
our backlog is the value of software license contracts entered into by us with customers or resellers for which no revenue or deferred revenue has been recognized 
our backlog increased substantially as of september  compared to recent quarters  during which our backlog had not varied significantly 
the increase occurred because we entered into a greater number of higher value software license contracts late in the quarter ended september  than we historically have done in prior quarters 
we expect that most of our backlog as of september  will be recognized as revenue in the year ending september  however  we do not believe that backlog is a meaningful indicator of future revenues in any particular period  because many of the contracts representing our backlog are cancelable or subject to performance conditions  a substantial portion of our license revenues in any period are realized from contracts entered into in that period  and an increasing portion of our revenues are realized from our services business 
we generally ship our software products shortly after entering into a license contract 
however  product shipment may be delayed for a number of factors  including factors within our discretion 
for example  delivery dates may be affected by the number of software license orders shipped or received in the quarter  the degree to which software license orders are concentrated at the end of the quarter  and our operational ability to fulfill software license orders at the end of the quarter 
any delay in shipping software products may have the effect of reducing revenue in the current period and increasing revenue in future periods

our settlement with softbank on october   resulted in a net cash outflow of million 
see overview of fiscal year settlement of dispute with softbank above and notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
after giving effect to the softbank settlement  we would have had million in cash  cash equivalents  investments and remaining restricted cash as of september   a decrease of million from september  
table of contents the increase in working capital of million at september  compared to september  is primarily attributable to an increase in our accounts receivable and a decrease in the current portion of deferred revenues  offset by a decrease in our short term investments and an increase in accrued liabilities  accrued compensation and related liabilities  accounts payable and restructuring obligations 
net cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended september   compared to net cash used in operating activities of million for the year ended september  net cash used in operating activities for the year ended september  is primarily attributable to the following an increase in accrued liabilities of million  which principally relates to the interim payments received from softbank totaling million  partially offset by the payment of million related to the settlement of a litigation matter involving a market alliance partner  an increase in accounts receivable of million primarily due to timing of collections  a decrease in deferred revenue of million principally due to recognition of more revenue from contracts entered into during prior periods than new deferrals originating in the current period  and to a reduction of deferred revenues of approximately million related to the settlement of a litigation matter  a net decrease in restructuring obligations of million due to rent paid for abandoned properties  a decrease in accrued compensation and related liabilities of million comprised primarily of reduced accruals for commissions and bonuses totaling million  partially offset by an increase of million related to our employee stock purchase plan  and a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets of million  which principally relates to acquisition costs related to our recently completed merger with freemarkets that were subsequently capitalized 
excluding the million interim payments from softbank  our operating activities would have used million in net cash rather than using million 
net cash provided by investing activities was million for the year ended september   compared to net cash provided by investing activities of million for the year ended september  net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended september  is primarily attributable to net sales of our investments of million  which was partially offset by the allocation of the million received in connection with the softbank interim payments recorded as restricted cash  and by net cash paid of million as a result of our merger with freemarkets and acquisitions of alliente and softface 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended september   compared to net cash provided by financing activities of million for the year ended september  net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended september  is primarily attributable to proceeds of million from the issuance of stock under the employee stock purchase plan and exercise of stock options  partially offset by million used to repurchase shares of our outstanding common stock 
as of september   we did not have any commitments for capital expenditures 

table of contents contractual obligations our primary contractual obligations are under our operating leases and a letter of credit which are discussed below 
in march  we entered into a facility lease agreement for approximately  square feet in four office buildings and an amenities building in sunnyvale  california for our headquarters 
the operating lease term commenced on january and ends on january  we occupy approximately  square feet in this facility 
we currently sublease two and one half buildings  totaling  square feet  to third parties 
these subleases expire on july   august  and may   respectively 
the remaining  square feet is available for sublease 
minimum monthly lease payments are approximately million and escalate annually  with the total future minimum lease payments amounting to million over the remaining lease term 
as part of this lease agreement  we are required to hold certificates of deposit  totaling million as of september   as a form of security through fiscal year also  we are required by other lease agreements to hold an additional million of standby letters of credit  which are cash collateralized 
these instruments are issued by our banks in lieu of a cash security deposit required by landlords for domestic and international real estate leases 
the total cash collateral of million is classified as restricted cash on our consolidated balance sheet as of september  we also occupy  square feet of office space in pittsburgh  pennsylvania under a lease covering  square feet that expires in may the remaining  square feet is available for sublease 
this location consists principally of our services organization and administrative activities 
future minimum lease and debt payments and sublease income under noncancelable operating leases for the next five years and thereafter are as follows as of september  in thousands year ending september  lease payments debt total obligations contractual sublease income net obligations thereafter total of the total operating lease commitments as of september  noted above  million is for occupied properties and million is for abandoned properties  which are a component of the restructuring obligation 
in november  we repaid in full an outstanding loan with the commonwealth of pennsylvania for  other arrangements other than the obligations identified above  we do not have commercial commitments under lines of credit  standby repurchase obligations or other such debt arrangements 
we have no off balance sheet arrangements or transactions with unconsolidated limited purpose entities  nor do we have any undisclosed material transactions or commitments involving related persons or entities 
we do not have any material noncancelable purchase commitments as of september  anticipated cash flows we expect to incur significant operating expenses  particularly services delivery costs  research and development expenses and sales and marketing expenses  for the foreseeable future in order to execute our business 
table of contents plan 
we anticipate that such operating expenses  as well as planned capital expenditures  will constitute a material use of our cash resources 
as a result  our net cash flows will depend heavily on the level of future sales  integration and merger related expenses  changes in deferred revenues  our ability to manage infrastructure costs  the outcome of our subleasing activities related to the costs of abandoning excess leased facilities  the use of cash under our stock repurchase program and ongoing regulatory and legal proceedings 
we believe our existing cash  cash equivalents and investment balances together with anticipated cash flow from operations should be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating resource expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months 
however  given the significant changes in our business and results of operations in the last twelve to eighteen months  the fluctuation in cash  cash equivalents and investments balances may be greater than presently anticipated 
see risk factors 
after the next twelve months  we may find it necessary to obtain additional funds 
in the event additional funds are required  we may not be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms or at all 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
accounting policies  methods and estimates are an integral part of the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap and  in part  are based upon management s current judgments 
those judgments are normally based on knowledge and experience with regard to past and current events and assumptions about future events 
certain accounting policies  methods and estimates are particularly sensitive because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting them may differ markedly from management s current judgments 
while there are a number of accounting policies  methods and estimates affecting our consolidated financial statements  areas that are particularly significant include revenue recognition policies  the assessment of recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets  restructuring obligations related to abandoned operating leases and contingencies related to the collectibility of accounts receivable and pending litigation 
these policies and our practices related to these policies are described below and in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition substantially all of our revenues are derived from three sources i licensing software  ii providing hosted software solutions  technical support and product updates  otherwise known as subscription and maintenance  and iii providing services including implementation services  consulting services  managed services  training  education  premium support and other miscellaneous items 
access to the ariba supplier network is available to our customers as part of their maintenance agreements for certain products 
we recognize revenue in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop and sop  staff accounting bulletin sab and emerging issues task force eitf issue we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
one of the critical judgments we make is the assessment that collectibility is probable 
our recognition of revenue is based on our assessment of the probability of collecting the related accounts receivable balance on a customer by customer basis considering past payment history and credit history 
the timing or amount of revenue recognition may have been different if different assessments of the probability of collection had been made at the time the transactions were recorded in revenue 
in cases where collectibility is not deemed probable  revenue is recognized at the time collection becomes probable  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
another critical judgment involves when fees are fixed or determinable 
in arrangements where at least of license fees are due within one year or less from delivery  the entire arrangement fee is considered fixed 
table of contents or determinable and revenue is recognized when the remaining basic revenue recognition criteria are met 
payment terms are considered extended when greater than of an arrangement fee is due beyond twelve months from delivery 
if fees are not fixed or determinable  revenue is recognized when fees are due and payable 
arrangements that include consulting services  such as systems implementation and process improvement projects  are evaluated to determine whether the services are essential to the functionality of other elements of the arrangement 
in making this determination  we consider the nature of services ie  consideration of whether the services are essential to the functionality of the licensed product  degree of risk  availability of services from other vendors  timing of payments and impact of milestones or acceptance criteria on the realizability of the software license fee 
we recognize software license revenue using the residual method pursuant to the requirements of sop  as amended by sop under the residual method  revenue is recognized in a multiple element arrangement involving software when ariba specific objective evidence of fair value exists for all of the undelivered elements in the arrangement  but does not exist for one of the delivered elements in the arrangement 
we defer revenue for the fair value of the undelivered elements  such as maintenance and professional services  and recognize revenue for the remainder of the arrangement fee attributable to the delivered elements ie  software products when the basic criteria in sop have been met 
as such  discounts  if any  are allocated to the license element and no discount is applied to undelivered elements 
where the contract does not include software  we allocate revenue to each element in a multiple element arrangement based on its respective fair value 
our determination of the fair value of each element in multi element arrangement involving software is based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe  which is limited to the price when sold separately 
for all other transactions not involving software  fair value is determined using price when sold separately or other methods allowable under eitf accounting for multiple elements under sop or eitf issue may result in significant deferrals of license revenue from the date of license delivery  the precise timing of which may be uncertain 
the classification of deferred revenues between current and non current is based on the determination as to whether the recognition will occur within the next twelve months or thereafter 
the actual timing of revenue recognition will depend on when the four basic revenue recognition criteria are met and can vary based on the timing of product acceptance  delivery of specified upgrades  completion of services  delivery of future products available under options and many other factors 
while it may be difficult to predict the timing of revenue recognition  in most cases the determination of when revenue recognition is appropriate is not subject to significant judgment 
allowance for doubtful accounts receivable we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts at an amount we estimate to be sufficient to provide for actual losses resulting from collecting less than full payment on our receivables 
a considerable amount of judgment is required when we assess the realizability of receivables  including assessing the probability of collection and the current credit worthiness of each customer 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  an additional provision for doubtful accounts might be required 
in cases where we are aware of circumstances that may impair a specific customer s ability to meet its financial obligations  we record a specific allowance against amounts due  and thereby reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
for the remaining customers  we recognize allowances for doubtful accounts based on the length of time the aggregate receivables are outstanding  the current business environment and historical experience 
alternatively  if the financial condition of our customers were to improve such that their ability to make payments was no longer considered impaired  we would reduce related estimated reserves with a credit to the provision for doubtful accounts 
recoverability of goodwill on september   we had million of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet 
of this amount  million resulted from the acquisitions of alliente and softface in the second and third quarters of 
table of contents fiscal year  respectively  million resulted from our merger with freemarkets and approximately million resulted from acquisitions completed in fiscal year we review goodwill for impairment annually and more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired and that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include  but are not limited to  significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and decreases in our market capitalization below net assets for a sustained period 
our stock price is highly volatile and has experienced significant declines during fiscal year and as of september   our net asset value of million exceeded our market capitalization 
based on these two factors  we performed a test for goodwill impairment as of september  and determined that based upon our implied fair value which includes factors such as  but not limited to  our market capitalization  an expected market control premium and recent stock price volatility as of september   there was no impairment of goodwill 
although no goodwill impairment has been recorded for the years ended september   and  there can be no assurances that future goodwill impairments will not occur 
when management determines that an impairment review is necessary based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we must determine if the carrying amount of our reporting unit level exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit level we have only one reporting unit  specifically the license  implementation and support of our software applications  based on quoted market prices of our common stock  which would indicate that goodwill may be impaired 
if we determine that goodwill may be impaired  we compare the implied fair value of the goodwill  as defined by sfas no 
 to its carrying amount to determine the impairment loss  if any 
we have recorded significant impairment charges for goodwill and other intangible assets in the past  and to the extent that events or circumstances cause our assumptions to change  additional charges may be required which could be material 
lease abandonment costs we initially recorded a significant restructuring charge in the third quarter of fiscal year upon abandoning certain operating leases as part of a program to restructure our operations and related facilities 
in the years ended september  and  we revised our original estimates and expectations for our corporate headquarters and field offices disposition efforts as a result of changed estimates of sublease commencement dates and rental rate projections to reflect continued declines in market conditions in the commercial real estate market in northern california 
during the year ended september   due to further consolidation and abandonment of additional facilities as the result of our merger with freemarkets  we recorded additional restructuring costs of million 
we also i revised our estimates for sublease commencement dates and rental rate projections to reflect continued declines in market conditions in the real estate market primarily in northern california  resulting in an additional charge of million  and ii recorded a benefit to operating expense totaling million  primarily as a result of entering into a sublease agreement which was not anticipated in previous estimates of the restructuring obligation 
in addition  we assumed lease abandonment liabilities of million as of july  related to the former headquarters of freemarkets in pittsburgh  pennsylvania 
lease abandonment costs for the abandoned facilities were estimated to include remaining lease liabilities and brokerage fees offset by estimated sublease income 
estimates related to sublease costs and income are based on assumptions regarding the period required to locate and contract with suitable sub lessees and sublease rates which were achieved using market trend information analyses provided by a commercial real estate brokerage firm retained by us 
each reporting period we review these estimates  and to the extent that our assumptions change  the ultimate restructuring expenses for these abandoned facilities could vary significantly from current estimates 

table of contents as of september   we had contractual commitments of million for abandoned properties 
our lease abandonment accrual is net of million of estimated sublease income 
actual sublease payments due under noncancelable subleases of excess facilities totaled million as of september   and the remainder of anticipated sublease income represents management s estimate of amounts to be received under future subleases 
actual future cash requirements and lease abandonment costs may differ materially from the accrual at september   particularly if actual sublease income is significantly different from current estimates 
these differences could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and cash position 
for example  a reduction in assumed market lease rates of per square foot per month for the remaining term of the lease  with all other assumptions remaining the same  would increase the estimated lease abandonment loss on our sunnyvale  california headquarters and our other principal office in pittsburgh  pennsylvania as of september  by approximately million 
legal contingencies we are subject to various claims and legal actions 
see legal proceedings 
we have accrued for estimated losses in accordance with gaap for those matters where we believe that the likelihood that a loss has occurred is probable and the amount of loss is reasonably estimable 
although we currently believe that we have properly accrued for estimable and probable losses regarding the outcome of outstanding legal proceedings  claims and litigation involving us  litigation is inherently uncertain  and there can be no assurance that existing or future litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition or that the current amount of accrued losses is sufficient for any actual losses that may be incurred 
risk factors in addition to other information in this form k  the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating ariba and our business because such factors may have a significant impact on our business  operating results and financial condition 
as a result of the risk factors set forth below and elsewhere in this form k  including in overview of fiscal year ended and outlook for fiscal year  actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forward looking statements 
we compete in new and rapidly evolving markets  and our spend management solutions are at a relatively early stage of development 
these factors make evaluation of our future prospects difficult 
spend management software applications and services are at a relatively early stage of development 
we introduced our initial ariba spend management solutions in september  and we have recently introduced several new products that have achieved limited deployment  including recent product releases and upgrades integrating functionality acquired in our recent merger with freemarkets 
these products may be more challenging to implement than our more established products  as we have less experience deploying these applications 
the markets in which we compete are characterized by rapid technological change  evolving customer needs and frequent introductions of new products and services 
as we adjust to evolving customer requirements and competitive pressures  we may be required to further reposition our product and service offerings and introduce new products and services 
we may not be successful in developing and marketing such product and service offerings  or we may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the development and marketing of such product and service offerings  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
economic conditions and reduced information technology spending may adversely impact our business 
our business depends on the overall demand for enterprise software and services and on the economic health of our current and prospective customers 
weak global economic conditions in recent years and the related decline in information technology spending has hurt our business 
continued weak economic conditions  or a continued reduction in information technology spending even if economic conditions improve  could adversely 
table of contents impact our business in a number of ways including longer sales cycles  lower average selling prices and reduced bookings and revenues 
our merger with freemarkets is subject to a number of risks 
on july   we completed our merger with freemarkets  which provides enterprises with software  services and information for global supply management 
our merger with freemarkets is subject to a number of risks 
among other things  achievement of the expected benefits of the merger  including cost savings  will depend on successfully integrating the operations and personnel of the two geographically separate companies  including the relocation to our pittsburgh office of a number of functions and processes previously performed in our sunnyvale office that are part of our internal control over financial reporting  offering the complementary products and services of each company to the other company s existing customers  and developing new products and services that utilize the assets of both companies 
in addition  the merger could adversely affect our financial results  adversely affect our stock price or result in lost revenues and business opportunities as a result of customer confusion 
if any of these or other risks relating to the merger occur  our business and prospects may be seriously harmed 
our success depends on market acceptance of standalone spend management solutions 
our success depends on widespread customer acceptance of standalone spend management solutions from vendors like ariba  rather than solutions from enterprise resource planning erp software vendors and others that are part of a broader enterprise application solution 
for example  erp vendors  such as oracle  sap and peoplesoft  could bundle spend management modules with their existing applications and offer these modules at little or no cost 
if our products and services do not achieve continued customer acceptance  our business will be seriously harmed 
we have a history of losses and may incur significant additional losses in the future 
we have a significant accumulated deficit as of september   resulting in large part from cumulative charges for the amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets and the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets 
we may incur significant losses in the future for a number of reasons  including those discussed in subsequent risk factors and the following adverse economic conditions  in particular declines in information technology spending  and corporate and consumer confidence in the economy  the failure of our standalone spend management solution business to mature as a separate market category  declines in average selling prices of our products and services resulting from competition  our introduction of newer products that generally have lower list prices than our more established products and other factors  failure to successfully grow our sales channels in europe and japan  increased reliance on managed services and subscription offerings that result in lower near term revenues from customer deployments  failure to maintain tight control over costs  
table of contents increased restructuring charges resulting from the failure to sublease excess facilities at anticipated levels and rates  the impact of our merger with freemarkets  including ongoing charges related to the amortization of intangibles  and charges incurred in connection with any future restructurings 
our quarterly operating results are volatile  difficult to predict and may be unreliable as indicators of future performance trends 
our quarterly operating results have varied significantly in the past and will likely vary significantly in the future 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance trends 
our quarterly operating results have varied or may vary depending on a number of factors  including the following risks related to revenues fluctuations in demand  sales cycles and average selling price for our products and services  reductions in customers budgets for information technology purchases and delays in their purchasing cycles  a decline in the volume or rate of our sourcing services or a shift from these services formerly known as fullsource to our lower cost self service product  ariba quicksource  fluctuations in the number of relatively larger orders for our products and services  increased dependence on relatively smaller orders from a larger number of customers  increased dependence on the number of new customer contracts in the current quarter  including follow on contracts from existing customers  rather than on contracts entered into in prior quarters  increased dependence on generating revenues from new revenue sources  delays in recognizing revenue from licenses of software products  changes in the mix of types of licensing arrangements and related timing of revenue recognition  the impact of recent declines in our deferred revenue  changes in our product line and customer demand resulting from our merger with freemarkets  and the impact of the restatement of our consolidated financial statements and our ongoing legal proceedings on customer demand 
risks related to expenses our overall ability to control costs  including managing reductions in expense levels through restructuring and severance payments  the level of expenditures relating to ongoing legal proceedings  costs associated with changes in our pricing policies and business model  including increased reliance on managed solutions offerings and the implementation of programs to generate revenue from new sources  costs associated with the merger with and integration of freemarkets into ariba  including the amortization of other intangible assets and stock based compensation expense  and the failure to adjust our workforce to changes in the level of our operations 

table of contents our business could be seriously harmed if we fail to retain our key personnel 
our future performance depends on the continued service of our senior management  product development and sales personnel 
the loss of the services of one or more of these personnel could seriously harm our business 
our ability to retain key employees may be harder given the cultural and geographic aspects of combining our sunnyvale  california and pittsburgh  pennsylvania based operations following our merger with freemarkets 
in addition  uncertainty created by turnover of key employees could result in reduced confidence in our financial performance which could cause fluctuations in our stock price and result in further turnover of our employees 
our revenues in any quarter may fluctuate because we depend on a relatively small number of relatively large orders 
our quarterly revenues are especially subject to fluctuation because they depend on the sale of relatively large orders for our products and related services 
for example  between three and eight individual customers represented at least of our license revenues for each quarter in each of our last two fiscal years 
in addition  many of these relatively large orders are realized at the end of the quarter 
as a result of this concentration and timing  our quarterly operating results  including average selling prices  may fluctuate significantly if we are unable to complete one or more substantial sales in any given quarter 
our revenues in any quarter may fluctuate significantly because our sales cycles are long and can be unpredictable 
our sales cycles are long and can be unpredictable 
the purchase of our products is often discretionary and generally involves a significant commitment of capital and other resources by a customer 
it frequently takes several months to finalize a sale and requires approval at a number of management levels within the customer organization 
the implementation and deployment of our products requires a significant commitment of resources by our customers and third parties and or professional services organizations 
an increased demand for term licenses and subscriptions or hosted applications by customers may result in deferral of revenues and cash payments from customers 
customers may purchase a perpetual license for our software or purchase the software for a specified period of time through a term license or a subscription 
if an increasing portion of customers choose term licenses or subscriptions  we may experience a deferral of revenues and cash payments from customers 
similarly  if an increasing portion of customers request application hosting services  we may experience a deferral of revenues and cash payments from customers 

table of contents revenues in any quarter may vary to the extent recognition of revenue is deferred when contracts are signed 
as a result  revenues in any quarter may be difficult to predict and unreliable indicators of future performance trends 
we frequently enter into contracts where we recognize only a portion of the total revenue under the contract in the quarter in which we enter into the contract 
for example  we may recognize revenue on a ratable basis over the life of the contract or enter into contracts where the recognition of revenue is conditioned upon delivery of future product or service elements 
the portion of revenues recognized on a deferred basis may vary significantly in any given quarter  and revenues in any given quarter are a function both of contracts signed in such quarter and contracts signed in prior quarters 
we anticipate that license revenues in future quarters will generally be more dependent on revenues from new customer contracts entered into in those quarters rather than from amortization or recognition of license revenues deferred in prior quarters 
revenues from our ariba sourcing solution which includes the service formerly known as fullsource could be negatively affected if customers elect to purchase our self service products rather than our technology enhanced services 
subscription revenue from our full service sourcing services offering formerly known as fullsource has been declining as existing customers renew contracts for lower dollar volumes and or purchase our lower priced self service technologies such as ariba quicksource 
we have several large multi year contracts for these technology enhanced services  many of which will come up for renewal during fiscal year if these customers do not renew their contracts upon expiration  or if they elect to use one of our lower cost self service solutions  our future revenues may decrease 
a decline in revenues may have a disproportionate impact on operating results and require further reductions in our operating expense levels 
because our expense levels are relatively fixed in the near term and are based in part on expectations of our future revenues  any decline in our revenues to a level that is below our expectations would have a disproportionately adverse impact on our operating results for that quarter 
we are subject to evolving and expensive corporate governance regulations and requirements 
our failure to adequately adhere to these requirements or the failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures could seriously harm our business 
because we are a publicly traded company  we are subject to certain federal  state and other rules and regulations  including rules and regulations recently adopted in response to laws adopted by congress  such as the sarbanes oxley act of compliance with these evolving regulations is costly and requires a significant diversion of management time and attention  particularly with regard to our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting 
although we have reviewed our disclosure and internal controls and procedures in order to determine whether they are effective  our controls and procedures may not be able to prevent other than inconsequential errors or fraud in the future 
faulty judgments  simple errors or mistakes  or the failure of our personnel to adhere to established controls and procedures may make it impossible for us to ensure that the objectives of the control system are met 
a failure of our controls and procedures to detect other than inconsequential errors or fraud could seriously harm our business and results of operations 
we sometimes experience long implementation cycles  which may increase our operating costs and delay recognition of revenues 
many of our products are complex applications that are generally deployed with many users 
implementation of these applications by enterprises is complex  time consuming and expensive 
long implementation cycles may delay the recognition of revenue as some of our customers engage us to perform 
table of contents system implementation services  which can defer revenue recognition for the related software license revenue 
in addition  when we experience long implementation cycles  we may incur costs at a higher level than anticipated  which may reduce the anticipated profitability of a given implementation 
if a sufficient number of suppliers do not join and maintain their participation in the ariba supplier network  particularly in light of our recently announced plan to charge our higher transaction volume suppliers for access to the network  it may not attract a sufficient number of buyers and other sellers required to make the network successful 
in order to provide buyers on the ariba supplier network an organized method for accessing goods and services  we rely on suppliers to maintain web based product catalogs  indexing services and other content aggregation tools 
any failure of suppliers to join the ariba supplier network in sufficient numbers  or of existing suppliers to maintain their participation in the ariba supplier network  would make the network less attractive to buyers and consequently other suppliers 
we recently announced our plan to begin charging select suppliers for access to the ariba supplier network  which could make it less attractive for suppliers to join or maintain their participation in the network 
our inability to access and index these catalogs and services provided by suppliers would result in our customers having fewer products and services available to them through our solutions  which would adversely affect the perceived usefulness of the ariba supplier network 
we could be subject to potential claims related to the ariba supplier network 
we warrant that the ariba supplier network will achieve specified performance levels to allow our customers to conduct their transactions 
to the extent we fail to meet warranted performance levels  we could be obligated to provide refunds of maintenance fees or credits toward future maintenance fees 
further  to the extent that a customer incurs significant financial hardship due to the failure of the ariba supplier network to perform as warranted  we could be exposed to additional liability claims 
failure to establish and maintain strategic relationships with third parties could seriously harm our business 
we have established strategic relationships with a number of other companies 
these companies are entitled to resell our products  to host our products for their customers  and or to implement our products within their customers organizations 
we cannot be assured that any existing or future resellers or hosting or implementation partners will perform to our expectations 
for example  in the past we have not realized the anticipated benefits from strategic relationships with a number of resellers 
if our current or future strategic partners do not perform to expectations  or if they experience financial difficulties that impair their operating capabilities  our business  operating results and financial condition could be seriously harmed 
we face intense competition 
if we are unable to compete successfully  our business will be seriously harmed 
the market for our solutions is intensely competitive  evolving and subject to rapid technological change 
the intensity of competition has increased and is expected to further increase in the future 
this increased competition has resulted in price reductions and could result in further price pressure  reduced profit margins and loss of market share  any one of which could seriously harm our business 
competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the products and services they offer 
we compete with several major enterprise software companies  including sap  oracle and peoplesoft 
we also compete with several service providers  including mckinsey and at kearney 
in addition  we occasionally compete with other small niche providers of sourcing or procurement products and services  including emptoris  frictionless commerce  ketera technologies  perfect commerce  procuri and verticalnet 
because spend management is a relatively new software category  we expect additional competition from other established and emerging companies if this market continues to develop and expand 
for example  third parties that currently help implement ariba buyer and our other products could begin 
table of contents to market products and services that compete with our products and services 
these third parties  which include ibm  accenture  capgemini  deloitte consulting  bearingpoint and unisys  are generally not subject to confidentiality or non compete agreements that restrict such competitive behavior 
many of our current and potential competitors  such as enterprise resource planning software vendors including oracle  sap and peoplesoft  have longer operating histories  significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources  significantly greater name recognition and a larger installed base of customers than us 
these vendors could also introduce spend management solutions that are included as part of broader enterprise application solutions at little or no cost 
in addition  many of our competitors have well established relationships with our current and potential customers and have extensive knowledge of our industry 
in the past  we have lost potential customers to competitors for various reasons  including lower prices and incentives not matched by us 
in addition  current and potential competitors have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase the ability of their products to address customer needs 
accordingly  it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly increase their market share 
we also expect that competition will increase as a result of industry consolidations 
as a result  we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors 
our acquisitions are  and any future acquisitions will be  subject to a number of risks 
we completed our merger with freemarkets on july   and we acquired softface on april  and alliente on january  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
our acquisitions of alliente  softface and freemarkets are  and any future acquisitions will be  subject to a number of additional risks  including the diversion of management time and resources  the difficulty of assimilating the operations and personnel of the acquired companies  the potential disruption of our ongoing businesses  the difficulty of incorporating acquired technology and rights into our products and services  unanticipated expenses related to integration of the acquired company  difficulties in implementing and maintaining uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies  the impairment of relationships with employees and customers as a result of any integration of new management personnel  and potential unknown liabilities associated with acquired businesses 
see also our merger with freemarkets is subject to a number of risks 
if we fail to develop products and services on a timely and cost effective basis  or if our products contain defects  our business could be seriously harmed 
in developing new products and services  we may fail to develop  introduce and market products in a timely or cost effective manner  find that our products and services are obsolete  noncompetitive or have shorter life cycles than expected  fail to develop new products and services that adequately meet customer requirements or achieve market acceptance  or develop products that contain undetected errors or failures when first introduced or as new versions are released 

table of contents for example  the introduction of version of ariba buyer was delayed significantly in the first quarter of fiscal year  and we have experienced delays in the introduction of other products and releases in the past 
if new releases of our products or potential new products are delayed  we could experience a delay or loss of revenues and customer dissatisfaction 
litigation regarding the ariba and freemarkets ipos could seriously harm our business 
between march  and june   a number of purported shareholder class action complaints were filed in the united states district court for the southern district of new york against ariba  certain of our former officers and directors the ariba individual defendants and three of the underwriters of our initial public offering the ariba ipo 
these actions purport to be brought on behalf of purchasers of our common stock in the period from june   the date of the ariba ipo  to december  in some cases  to december or   and make certain claims under the federal securities laws  including sections and of the securities act and sections b and a of the exchange act  relating to the ariba ipo 
in addition  since july   a number of purported shareholder class action complaints were filed in the united states district court for the southern district of new york against freemarkets  certain of its officers and directors the freemarkets individual defendants and the underwriters of freemarkets initial public offering the freemarkets ipo 
these actions purport to be brought on behalf of purchasers of freemarkets common stock in the period from december   the date of the freemarkets ipo  to december  in some cases  to july   and make claims relating to the freemarkets ipo similar to the claims made in the ariba ipo actions 
on june   the ariba ipo actions were consolidated into a single action bearing the title in re ariba  inc securities litigation  civ similarly  the freemarkets ipo actions were consolidated into a single action bearing the title steffey v 
freemarkets  inc et al  civ on august   those consolidated actions were further consolidated for pretrial purposes  with cases brought against additional issuers who numbered in excess of and their underwriters that made similar allegations regarding the ipos of those issuers 
on february   the parties signed and filed a stipulation dismissing the consolidated action without prejudice against ariba  freemarkets and certain individual defendants  which the court approved and entered as an order on march  on april   the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint in which they dropped their claims against ariba  freemarkets and all of the ariba individual defendants and the freemarkets individual defendants under sections and of the securities act  but elected to proceed with their claims against such defendants under sections b and a of the exchange act 
the amended consolidated complaint alleges that the prospectuses pursuant to which shares of common stock were sold in the ariba ipo and the freemarket ipo  which were incorporated in registration statements filed with the sec  contained certain false and misleading statements or omissions regarding the practices of our and freemarkets underwriters with respect to their allocations to their customers of shares of common stock in the ipos and their receipt of commissions from those customers related to such allocations 
the complaint further alleges that the underwriters provided positive analyst coverage of ariba and freemarkets after their respective ipos  which had the effect of manipulating the market for our stock and freemarkets stock respectively 
plaintiffs contend that such statements and omissions from the prospectuses and the alleged market manipulation by the underwriters through the use of analysts caused the post ipo stock prices of ariba and freemarkets to be artificially inflated 
plaintiffs seek compensatory damages in unspecified amounts as well as other relief 
on july   ariba  freemarkets and the ariba individual defendants and the freemarkets individual defendants  along with other issuers and their related officer and director defendants  filed a joint motion to dismiss based on common issues 
on or around november   during the pendency of the motion to dismiss  the court entered as an order a stipulation by which all of the individual defendants were dismissed from the case without prejudice in return for executing a tolling agreement 
on february   the court rendered its decision on the motion to dismiss  granting a dismissal of the remaining section b claims against ariba and freemarkets without prejudice 
plaintiffs have indicated that they intend to file an amended complaint 

table of contents on june   a special litigation committee of the ariba board of directors approved a memorandum of understanding the mou reflecting a settlement in which the plaintiffs agreed to dismiss the case against ariba with prejudice in return for the assignment by ariba of claims that it might have against its underwriters 
no payment to the plaintiffs by ariba was required under the mou 
on june   a special litigation committee of the freemarkets board of directors approved a substantively identical mou with respect to freemarkets 
after further negotiations  the essential terms of the mous were formalized in a stipulation and agreement of settlement  which has been executed on ariba s and freemarkets behalf and on behalf of the ariba individual defendants and the freemarkets individual defendants 
the settling parties filed formal motions seeking preliminary approval of the proposed settlement on june  the underwriter defendants  who are not parties to the proposed settlement  filed a brief objecting to the settlement s terms on july  in the meantime  the plaintiffs and underwriters have continued to litigate the consolidated action 
the litigation is proceeding through the class certification phase by focusing on six cases chosen by the plaintiffs and underwriters 
neither ariba nor freemarkets is a focus case 
the court issued an order on october  certifying classes in each of the six focus cases 
there can be no assurance that the proposed settlement will be approved by the court 
in the event that the settlement is not approved by the court  we intend to vigorously defend against these claims 
litigation arising out of the restatement of our consolidated financial statements could seriously harm our business 
beginning january   a number of purported shareholder class action complaints were filed in the united states district court for the northern district of california against us and certain of our current and former officers and directors  all purporting to be brought on behalf of a class of purchasers of our common stock in the period from january  to january  the complaints bring claims under the federal securities laws  specifically sections b and a of the exchange act  relating to our announcement that we would restate certain of our consolidated financial statements  and also  in the case of two complaints  relating to our acquisition activity and related accounting 
specifically  these actions allege that certain of our prior consolidated financial statements contained false and misleading statements or omissions relating to our failure to properly recognize expenses and other financial items  as reflected in the then proposed restatement 
plaintiffs contend that such statements or omissions caused our stock price to be artificially inflated 
plaintiffs seek compensatory damages as well as other relief 
on july   the court entered two orders that consolidated the cases for all purposes into a single action captioned in re ariba  inc securities litigation  case no 
c jf  appointed a lead plaintiff  and approved the lead plaintiff s selection of counsel 
on september   the lead plaintiff filed a consolidated amended complaint  which restated the allegations and claims described above and added a claim pursuant to section a of the exchange act  based on the allegation that we failed to disclose certain payments and executive compensation items in our january  proxy statement 
prior to the hearing on defendants motion to dismiss the consolidated complaint  the parties stipulated that plaintiff would withdraw its complaint and file a further amended complaint by april  plaintiffs allegations of wrongdoing in this further amended complaint are limited to our alleged failure to disclose certain payments and executive compensation items 
defendants motion to dismiss plaintiff s further amended complaint was filed on june  a hearing on the motion took place on october   and the motion is now under submission 
beginning january   several shareholder derivative actions were filed in the superior court of california for the county of santa clara against certain of our current and former officers and directors and against us as nominal defendant 
the actions were filed by stockholders purporting to assert  on our behalf  claims for breach of fiduciary duties  aiding and abetting  violations of the california insider trading law  abuse of control  gross mismanagement  waste of corporate assets  unjust enrichment  and contribution and indemnification 
specifically  the claims were based on our acquisition activity and related accounting implemented by the defendants  the alleged understatement of compensation expenses as reflected in our then 
table of contents proposed restatement  the alleged insider trading by certain defendants  the existence of the restatement class action litigation  and the allegedly excessive compensation paid by us to one of our officers  as reflected in our then proposed restatement 
the complaints sought the payment by the defendants to ariba of damages allegedly suffered by it  as well as other relief 
on may   the court issued an order that consolidated the cases for all purposes into a single action captioned in re ariba  inc shareholder derivative litigation  lead case no 
cv  and appointed lead counsel 
plaintiffs filed an amended consolidated derivative complaint on may  the consolidated complaint restated the allegations  causes of action and relief sought as pleaded in the original complaints  and added allegations relating to our april  announcement of the restatement of certain financial statements and also added a cause of action for breach of contract 
on october   we filed a demurrer  joined by the individual defendants  seeking dismissal of the action for failure to comply with applicable pre litigation demand requirements 
on january   the court granted our demurrer and gave plaintiffs leave to file an amended complaint 
after limited demand discovery  plaintiffs filed a second amended consolidated derivative complaint on september  our demurrer to the second amended complaint brought on the same grounds as our first demurrer was filed on november  a hearing on the demurrer is scheduled for march  on march and march   respectively  two shareholder derivative actions were filed in the united states district court for the northern district of california against certain of our current and former officers and directors and against us as nominal defendant 
these actions were filed by shareholders purporting to assert  on our behalf  claims for violations of the sarbanes oxley act  violations of the california insider trading law  breach of fiduciary duties  misappropriation of information  abuse of control  gross mismanagement  waste of corporate assets and unjust enrichment 
specifically  the claims were based on our announcements that we intended to and or had restated certain financial statements and on alleged insider trading by certain defendants 
the complaints sought the payment by the defendants to ariba of damages allegedly suffered by ariba  as well as other relief 
on june   the court issued an order that consolidated the two derivative cases for all purposes into a single action captioned in re ariba  inc derivative litigation  case no 
c jf  and appointed lead counsel 
plaintiffs filed an amended consolidated derivative complaint on june  on september   defendants filed a motion to dismiss or stay the action pending resolution of the parallel state court derivative litigation 
following a hearing  the court issued a ruling on november  denying the motion but granting defendants alternative request for a stay of the action in light of the related securities class action litigation 
accordingly  this action is now stayed until the court has determined the viability of the federal securities claim in the related action 
litigating existing and potential securities class actions and shareholder derivative actions relating to the restatement of our consolidated financial statements will likely require significant attention and resources of management and  regardless of the outcome  result in significant legal expenses 
in the case of the securities class actions  if our defenses were ultimately unsuccessful  or if we were unable to achieve a favorable settlement  we could be liable for large damages awards that could seriously harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
litigation resulting from our merger with freemarkets could seriously harm our business on september   a purported shareholder class action was filed against us and the individual board members of the freemarkets board of directors in delaware chancery court by stockholders who held freemarkets common stock from january  through july  the complaint alleges various breaches of fiduciary duty and a violation of the delaware general corporation law on the part of the former freemarkets board members in connection with our merger with freemarkets which was consummated on july  the plaintiff in this action contends  among other things  that the freemarkets board members breached their 
table of contents fiduciary duties to freemarkets common stockholders by negotiating the merger with us so as to provide themselves with downside protection against a decline in our market price through a beneficial option exchange formula while failing to provide the common stockholders protection in the event of a drop in the price of our stock  by contractually obligating themselves to recommend unanimously that freemarkets stockholders approve the merger  by failing to disclose to freemarkets stockholders certain material information before the merger closed  and by breaching their duties of loyalty to the common stockholders in various other respects 
as freemarkets corporate successor  we are alleged to be liable for the freemarkets board member s violation of the delaware general corporation law 
plaintiff seeks disgorgement of benefits by the individual defendants  as well as monetary and rescissory damages from all of the defendants  jointly and severally 
the defendants motion to dismiss the complaint is due to be submitted to the delaware chancery court on january  beginning in april  eleven securities fraud class action complaints were filed against freemarkets and two of its executive officers in the united states district court in pittsburgh  pennsylvania 
the complaints  all of which assert the same claims  stem from freemarkets announcement on april  that  as a result of discussions with the sec  it was considering amending its fiscal year financial statements for the purpose of reclassifying fees earned by freemarkets under a service contract with visteon 
all of the cases have been consolidated into a single proceeding 
on october   freemarkets filed a motion seeking to dismiss all of the cases in their entirety 
on january   the court denied the motion to dismiss 
on march   the court certified the case as a class action 
the certification order is now on appeal to the united states court of appeals for the third circuit 
although the case is in the discovery phase  only a limited amount of discovery has been taken 
we believe that the plaintiffs allegations are without merit and we intend to continue to vigorously defend against these claims 
defending against class action litigation resulting from our merger with freemarkets may require significant management time and  regardless of the outcome  result in significant legal expenses 
if our defenses are unsuccessful or we are unable to settle on favorable terms  we could be liable for large damages that could seriously harm our business and results of operations 
the sec inquiry regarding the restatement of certain of our financial statements during fiscal year could seriously harm our business 
in fiscal year  the sec commenced an informal inquiry regarding the circumstances leading up to the restatement in fiscal year of our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended september  and and the quarters ended december  through june  responding to any such review could require significant diversion of management s attention and resources in the future 
for example  if the sec elects to pursue an enforcement action  the defense against this type of action could be costly and require additional management resources 
if we are unsuccessful in defending against any such enforcement action  we may face civil or criminal penalties or fines that could seriously harm our business and results of operations 
patent infringement litigation could seriously harm our business on may   a patent infringement action was filed against us in the united states district court for the eastern district of virginia by eplus  inc alleging that three of our products  ariba buyer  ariba marketplace and ariba category procurement  infringe three us patents owned by eplus 
discovery in this case is complete and the trial has been scheduled for january  the court has indicated that it will bifurcate the trial and try the validity and infringement issues to the jury before trying the damages related issues 
both parties had moved for summary judgment in their favor on the question of infringement 
additionally  we had moved for summary judgment that certain claims in the patents in suit are invalid 
on november   the court denied all the summary judgment motions 
we cannot predict the outcome of this litigation 
if we were to lose  we could be liable for damages for past infringement 
plaintiff claims royalty damages of approximately million to million 
we dispute that we 
table of contents are liable for any damages and dispute plaintiff s calculation as to the amount of damages 
if we were to lose  we could be enjoined from selling the products at issue in the litigation and enjoined from inducing customers to infringe 
however  we believe we have strong defenses to eplus s claims and intend to vigorously defend against them 
we may incur additional restructuring charges that adversely affect our operating results 
we have recorded significant restructuring charges in the past relating to the abandonment of numerous leased facilities  including our sunnyvale  california headquarters 
moreover  we have from time to time revised our assumptions and expectations regarding lease abandonment costs  resulting in additional charges 
in addition  we have assumed abandoned leases and related costs as part of our merger with freemarkets 
for example  for the year ended september   we recorded a charge to operations of million for restructuring and integration costs  of which million represented merger related costs undertaken in connection with our merger with freemarkets in order to improve our post merger competitiveness  productivity and future operating results 
this charge consists of million for severance and related benefits for terminated ariba employees  million for lease abandonment costs associated with our sunnyvale facility  million for the impairment of leasehold improvements and million for other integration costs  primarily professional fees for integration  planning and implementation  partially offset by a benefit to operating expense totaling million primarily as a result of entering into a sublease agreement which was not anticipated in previous estimates of our restructuring obligations 
we also revised our estimates for sublease commencement dates and rental rate projections to reflect continued declines in market conditions in the real estate market primarily in northern california  resulting in an additional charge of million in the year ended september  we review these estimates each reporting period  and to the extent that our assumptions change  the ultimate restructuring expenses for these abandoned facilities could vary significantly from current estimates 
for example  a reduction in assumed market lease rates of per square foot per month for the remaining term of the lease  with all other assumptions remaining the same  would increase the estimated lease abandonment loss on our sunnyvale  california headquarters and our other principal office in pittsburgh  pennsylvania as of september  by approximately million 
additional lease abandonment costs  resulting from the abandonment of additional facilities or changes in estimates and expectations about facilities already abandoned  could adversely affect our operating results 
we may incur additional goodwill impairment charges that adversely affect our operating results 
on september  we had million of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet 
of this amount  million resulted from the acquisition of alliente and softface in the second and third quarters of fiscal year  respectively  million resulted from our merger with freemarkets in the fourth quarter of fiscal year and approximately million resulted from acquisitions completed in fiscal year our net assets as of september  were million and our market capitalization as of that date was million 
we review goodwill for impairment annually and more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired and that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include  but are not limited to  significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and decreases in our market capitalization below net assets for a sustained period 
our stock price is highly volatile and has experienced significant declines during fiscal year and as of september   our net asset value of million exceeded our market capitalization 
based on these two factors  we performed a test for goodwill impairment as of september  and determined that based upon the implied fair value which includes factors such as  but not limited to  our market capitalization  an expected market control premium and recent stock price volatility as of september   there was no impairment of goodwill 
although no goodwill impairment has been recorded for the years ended september   and  we have recorded significant impairment charges for goodwill and other intangible assets in the past and there can be no assurances that future goodwill impairments will not occur 

table of contents our stock price is highly volatile 
our stock price has fluctuated dramatically 
there is a significant risk that the market price of our common stock will decrease in the future in response to any of the following factors  some of which are beyond our control variations in our quarterly operating results  announcements that our revenues or income are below analysts expectations  changes in analysts estimates of our performance or industry performance  general economic slowdowns  changes in market valuations of similar companies  sales of large blocks of our common stock  announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts  acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments  loss of a major customer or failure to complete significant license transactions  additions or departures of key personnel  and fluctuations in stock market prices and volumes  which are particularly common among highly volatile securities of software and internet based companies 
we are at risk of further securities class action litigation due to our stock price volatility 
in the past  securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities 
we have recently experienced significant volatility in the price of our stock 
we may in the future be the target of similar litigation 
securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources  which could seriously harm our business 
if the protection of our intellectual property is inadequate  our competitors may gain access to our technology  and we may lose customers 
we depend on our ability to develop and maintain the proprietary rights of our technology 
to protect our proprietary technology  we rely primarily on a combination of contractual provisions  including customer licenses that restrict use of our products  confidentiality agreements and procedures  and patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws 
we have twelve patents issued in the united states and may not develop other proprietary products that are patentable 
despite our efforts  we may not be able to adequately protect our proprietary rights  and our competitors may independently develop similar technology  duplicate our products or design around any patents issued to us 
this is particularly true because some foreign laws do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as those of the united states and  in the case of the ariba supplier network  because the validity  enforceability and type of protection of proprietary rights in internet related industries are uncertain and evolving 
in the quarter ended march   we entered into an intellectual property agreement with ibm under which  among other things  each party granted to the other party a perpetual cross license to certain of the other party s patents which were issued at the time of the agreement or which were issued based on applications filed within three years after the agreement 
among other things  the cross license allows each party to make  use  import  license or sell certain products and services under such patents of the other party 
as such  the agreement forecloses each party from trying to enforce such patents against the other party by claiming that the other party s products and services violated the patents 

table of contents there has been a substantial amount of litigation in the software industry and the internet industry regarding intellectual property rights 
for example  we are a defendant in a lawsuit alleging that three of our products  ariba buyer  ariba marketplace and ariba category procurement  infringe patents held by a third party 
see legal proceedings patent infringement litigation for more information 
it is possible that in the future other third parties may claim that we or our current or potential future products infringe their intellectual property rights 
we expect that software product developers and providers of electronic commerce solutions will increasingly be subject to infringement claims  and third parties may claim that we or our current or potential future products infringe their intellectual property 
any claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all  which could seriously harm our business 
we must now  and may in the future have to  license or otherwise obtain access to intellectual property of third parties 
for example  we are currently dependent on developers licenses from enterprise resource planning  database  human resource and other system software vendors in order to ensure compliance of our products with their management systems 
in addition  we rely on technology that we license from third parties  including software that is integrated with internally developed software and used in our software products to perform key functions 
for example  we license integration software from tibco for ariba buyer 
if we are unable to continue to license any of this software on commercially reasonable terms  or at all  we will face delays in releases of our software until equivalent technology can be identified  licensed or developed  and integrated into our current products 
these delays  if they occur  could materially adversely affect our business 
our business is susceptible to numerous risks associated with international operations 
international operations have represented a significant portion of our revenues over the past three years  in significant part because of our strategic relationship with softbank 
see overview of fiscal year settlement of dispute with softbank above and notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements for the impact of our settlement with softbank 
we have committed and expect to continue to commit significant resources to our international sales and marketing activities 
we are subject to a number of risks associated with these activities 
these risks generally include currency exchange rate fluctuations  particularly as a result of the decline in the value of the us dollar compared to other foreign currencies  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs  export controls and other trade barriers  longer accounts receivable payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable  difficulties in managing and staffing international operations  potentially adverse foreign tax consequences  including withholding in connection with the repatriation of earnings  the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws  and political instability 
these risks could prevent or impede our planned efforts to grow our sales channels in europe and japan 
for international sales and expenditures denominated in foreign currencies  we are subject to risks associated with currency fluctuations 
we hedge risks associated with foreign currency transactions in order to minimize the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on earnings 
we utilize forward contracts to hedge trade and intercompany receivables and payables 
all hedge contracts are marked to market through operations each period 
there can be no assurance that our hedging strategy will be successful and that currency exchange rate fluctuations will not have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

table of contents anti takover provisions in our charter documents and delaware law could discourage  delay or prevent a change in control of our company and may affect the trading price of our common stock 
certain anti takeover provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and certain provisions of delaware law may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of the company without further action by the stockholders  may discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over the market price of our common stock and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and other rights of the holder of our common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk we develop products in the united states of america and market our products in the united states of america  latin america  europe  canada  australia  middle east and asia 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
since the majority of our non us sales are priced in currencies other than the us dollar  a strengthening of the dollar may reduce the level of reported revenues 
if any of the events described above were to occur  our net sales could be seriously impacted  since a significant portion of our net sales are derived from international operations 
for the years ended september   and  approximately  and  respectively  of our total net sales were derived from customers outside of the united states 
as a result  our us dollar earnings and net cash flows from international operations may be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
we use derivative instruments to manage risks associated with foreign currency transactions in order to minimize the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on earnings 
we utilize forward contracts to reduce our net exposures  by currency  related to the monetary assets and liabilities of our foreign operations denominated in local currency 
in addition  from time to time  we may enter into forward exchange contracts to establish with certainty the us dollar amount of future firm commitments denominated in a foreign currency 
the forward contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting and accordingly  all of these instruments are marked to market at each balance sheet date by a charge to earnings 
we believe that these forward contracts do not subject us to undue risk due to foreign exchange movements because gains and losses on these contracts are generally offset by losses and gains on the underlying assets and liabilities 
we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes 
all contracts have a maturity of less than one year 

table of contents the following table provides information about our foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding as of september  in thousands buy sell contract value unrealized gain loss in usd foreign currency foreign currency usd euro sell   euro buy australian dollar buy brazilian real buy japanese yen buy  singapore dollar buy total the unrealized gain loss represents the difference between the contract value and the market value of the contract based on market rates as of september  given our foreign exchange position  a ten percent change in foreign exchange rates upon which these forward exchange contracts are based would result in unrealized exchange gains or losses of approximately  in all material aspects  these exchange gains and losses would be fully offset by exchange losses or gains on the underlying net monetary exposures 
we do not expect material exchange rate gains and losses from other foreign currency exposures 
interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
this is accomplished by investing in widely diversified investments  consisting only of investment grade securities 
we hold investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments  and both carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which may have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
our investments may fall short of expectations due to changes in market conditions and as such we may suffer losses at the time of sale due to the decline in market value 
all investments in the table below are carried at market value  which approximates cost
