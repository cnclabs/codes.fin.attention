item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  including the notes thereto  appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview weider nutrition international  inc develops  manufactures  markets  distributes and sells branded and private label vitamins  nutritional supplements and sports nutrition products in the united states and throughout the world 
we offer a broad range of capsules and tablets  powdered drink mixes  ready to drink beverages and nutrition bars consisting of approximately stock keeping units skus 
our portfolio of recognized brands  including schiff  multipower  multaben  weider and tiger s milk  are primarily marketed through mass market  health food store and health club and gym distribution channels 
we market our branded nutritional supplement products  both domestically and internationally  in five principal categories specialty supplements  vitamins and minerals  sports nutrition  weight management  and nutrition bars 
our operating results for fiscal  and were affected by an industry slow down including lack of successful new product introductions  increased competitive pressures particularly from increasing private label growth  the implementation of our schiff move free initiatives to defend the brand against competition  the sale of our venice beach  american body building and science foods brands and our reorganization into three business units 
during the fiscal fourth quarter we began implementing our schiff grow move free initiative 
this initiative includes incremental selling and marketing support intended to both defend our move free business against competition  including private label  and ultimately to increase our market share in the joint care product category 
we believe that our fiscal move free and other branded joint category net sales benefited from the incremental investment  although we expect our grow move free initiative to continue in fiscal  we expect net sales to be relatively constant due to competitive conditions and other factors 
effective in our fiscal first quarter  we reclassified the weider germany branded business from our haleko unit to our active nutrition unit 
accordingly  weider germany branded sales are included in active s operating results 
haleko continues to provide manufacturing services for the weider germany business and therefore also includes the sale transfer of these products in its stand alone private label operating results 
these inter business unit sales from haleko to active nutrition are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements 
we have not restated the prior year business unit information to reflect this change because it was not practicable to do so 
in fiscal  we may experience margin volatility due to several factors  including a continuing strong competitive environment  product differentiation and new product introduction initiatives  and potentially significant raw material pricing pressures  particularly in the joint care category 
on august   we announced the agreement in principle to sell certain assets of our active nutrition unit relating to its weider branded business domestically and internationally to weider health and fitness whf  a privately held company headquartered in california and our majority stockholder 
the terms provide for a purchase price of approximately million in exchange for assets relating to our domestic weider branded business  including inventory  receivables  and intangible and intellectual property  the capital stock of certain of our international subsidiaries related to our international weider branded business  and the assumption of certain associated liabilities by whf 
the final purchase price is subject to upward or downward adjustment based upon the determinat ion of the divested business final working capital balance 
for the fiscal year ended may   the weider branded business generated net sales of approximately million and incurred an operating loss of approximately million excluding certain indirect costs primarily consisting of general and administrative expenses 
on may  the first day of haleko s fiscal year  we sold substantially all of the assets relating to haleko s germany based venice beach sports apparel brand 
the transaction included the sale of venice beach receivables  inventories  intellectual property and certain fixed assets and the assumption by the purchaser of approximately venice beach employees 
the net cumulative cash proceeds from the sale were approximately million 
in accordance with sfas no 
 operating results for venice beach are reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
on july   we announced the sale of substantially all of the assets and certain associated liabilities relating to our american body building and science foods brands 
the sales price included approximately million in cash and the assumption of an approximate million mortgage on the accompanying beverage facility 
the transaction resulted in a pre tax impairment loss of approximately million during the fiscal fourth quarter  primarily associated with the write off of goodwill and other intangible assets 
during fiscal  we initiated a plan to reorganize into three business units the schiff specialty unit  the haleko unit and the active nutrition unit 
the schiff specialty unit contains the schiff and schiff move free brands  as well as private label business limited to customers that otherwise carry our products 
the haleko unit  our primary european subsidiary  includes the multipower and multaben nutritional supplement brands and private label businesses 
the active nutrition unit includes weider branded global businesses  our tiger s milk brand and our export business which includes weider and schiff branded products 
the reorganization resulted in an approximate million charge during the fiscal second quarter  primarily associated with employee severance costs 
on june   we adopted sfas no 
and recognized an after tax goodwill impairment charge of approximately million 
factors affecting our historical results  including the previous implementation of strategic initiatives as well continuing refinement of our growth and business strategies  are ongoing considerations and processes 
while the focus of these considerations is to improve future profitability  no assurance can be given that our decisions relating to these initiatives will not adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition

net sales 
net sales increased approximately to million for fiscal  from million for fiscal the increase in net sales was primarily attributable to an increase in branded sales in our schiff specialty business unit and the positive impact of foreign currency exchange rates  partially offset by the loss of revenue due to the fiscal first quarter sale of our american body building and science foods brands 
fiscal net sales of american body building and science foods branded products  prior to divestiture  were million 
schiff specialty net sales increased approximately to million for fiscal  from million for fiscal the increase primarily resulted from increases in schiff move free and other joint product sales 
net sales of schiff move free were million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal we believe our fiscal move free and other branded joint category sales results benefited from our schiff grow move free initiative 
haleko net sales increased approximately to million for fiscal  from million for fiscal the positive impact of foreign currency exchange rates was more than offset by a decline in primarily branded multaben sales and private label sales volume 
excluding foreign currency exchange rates  net sales decreased primarily due to competitive pressures and economic conditions 
we re launched our leading multipower sports nutrition and multaben weight management brands during fiscal in response to recent sales trends 
we believe the wholesale repackaging  contemporizing and sku rationalization of these brands will strengthen their long term competitive positions in a weak german and european export market 
active nutrition net sales increased approximately to million for fiscal  from million for fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to the reclassification inclusion of million in weider germany branded sales a portion of which is also included in haleko private label sales before inter business unit eliminations  and the positive impact of foreign currency exchange rates 
the increase was partially offset by the fiscal first quarter sale of our american body building and science foods brands and a decrease in domestic weider branded sales 
prior to fiscal  weider germany branded sales were included only in haleko s operating results 
gross profit 
gross profit increased approximately to million for fiscal  from million for fiscal the increase in gross profit primarily resulted from an increase in higher margin branded schiff specialty sales  partially offset by reduced margins on private label revenues 
gross profit  as a percentage of net sales  was for fiscal  compared to for fiscal schiff specialty gross profit increased approximately to million for fiscal  from million for fiscal gross profit  as a percentage of net sales  was relatively constant at for fiscal  compared to for fiscal an increase in higher margin move free and other joint product sales offset the impact of reduced margins on private label sales

gross profit  as a percentage of net sales  remained relatively constant at and  respectively  for fiscal and active nutrition gross profit remained relatively constant at million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal gross profit  as a percentage of net sales  was for fiscal compared to for fiscal the inclusion of lower margin weider germany sales and an increase in domestic inventory valuation and sales return adjustments for underperforming new product introductions were the primary factors for the percentage decrease 
operating expenses 
operating expenses increased approximately to million fiscal  from million for fiscal the overall increase was primarily attributable to increases in selling and marketing costs in support of our brand building initiatives for all business units and the impact of foreign currency exchange rates 
selling and marketing expenses  including sales  marketing  advertising  freight and other costs  were million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal the increase in selling and marketing expenses resulted primarily from incremental transition and marketing costs associated with our grow move free project and long term move free strategy  increased selling and marketing in support of new products in our schiff specialty and active nutrition business units  increased personnel related costs in our active nutrition business unit and the impact of foreign currency exchange rates 
general and administrative expenses were million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal increases in aggregate legal related costs of approximately million were partially offset by the fiscal recovery of approximately million of previously recognized notes receivable valuation allowances and reduced haleko systems and personnel related costs  including impact from the sale of venice beach 
the impact of foreign currency exchange rates also contributed to the increase in general and administrative expenses 
research and development costs remained relatively constant at million for fiscal and amortization of intangible assets also remained relatively constant at million and million  respectively  for fiscal and other expense 
other expense  net  was million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal during fiscal  we settled certain outstanding notes receivable primarily through reacquiring  shares of our outstanding class a common stock 
as a result of these settlement transactions  we recognized approximately million in previously unrecognized interest income on the notes receivable 
during fiscal  we recognized a modest gain on the sale of certain assets held for sale which was substantially offset by the write down of an investment  both within our haleko business unit 
we also recognized less interest expense in fiscal due to an overall reduction in total indebtedness 
in november  we paid off million in remaining subordinated debt with borrowings available f rom our senior bank credit facility  which resulted in an approximate million write off of previously capitalized financing fees during fiscal also  we recognized approximate million gain on the sale of certain held for sale equity securities during fiscal provision for income taxes 
provision for income taxes was million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal the change resulted primarily from the decrease in pre tax earnings  and a modest reduction in our effective tax rate due to utilization of certain fully reserved capital loss carryforwards

net sales 
net sales decreased approximately to million for fiscal  from million for fiscal net sales decreased in fiscal primarily due to the sale of our american body building and science foods brands in july  growth of private label competition in joint care products and elimination of a low margin private label customer 
these factors resulted in significant net sales reductions in our active nutrition and haleko business units  and a more moderate overall net sales decrease in schiff specialty 
schiff specialty net sales decreased approximately to million for fiscal  from million for fiscal the decrease resulted from a reduction in sales of schiff move free  which was primarily attributable to increased private label competition 
the decrease was partially offset by an increase in private label sales 
net sales of schiff move free were million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal private label sales were million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal haleko net sales decreased approximately to million for fiscal  from million for fiscal the decrease primarily resulted from a decline in private label sales volume  partially offset by an increase in branded nutritional supplement net sales

schiff specialty gross profit decreased approximately to million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal gross profit  as a percentage of net sales  was for fiscal  compared to for fiscal the decrease resulted primarily from a change in product sales mix  including an increase in lower margin private label sales volume and a decrease in higher margin schiff move free sales  partially offset by lower net raw material costs 
haleko gross profit increased approximately to million for fiscal  from million for fiscal gross profit  as a percentage of net sales  was for fiscal  compared to for fiscal the increase primarily resulted from changes in product sales mix  including a reduction in lower margin private label sales  overhead cost improvements and lower inventory valuation charges 
active nutrition gross profit decreased approximately to million for fiscal  from million for fiscal  primarily resulting from a decrease in sales volume

operating expenses 
operating expenses were million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal the fiscal decrease was primarily attributable to fiscal charges not repeated in fiscal  including an asset impairment loss of million related to the sale of our american body building and science foods brands and severance and reorganization costs of million associated with our business unit realignment  partially offset by million in litigation settlement income 
furthermore  we adopted sfas no 
in fiscal  resulting in the discontinuation of goodwill amortization expense

selling and marketing expenses  including sales  marketing  advertising  freight and other costs  were million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal as a percentage of net sales  selling and marketing expenses were and  respectively  for fiscal and the increase  as a percentage of net sales  was primarily attributable to incremental transition and marketing costs associated with our long term move free strategy and changes in sales mix

research and development costs were million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal the increase primarily resulted from increases in product testing and related costs in our schiff specialty and haleko business units  partially offset by cost reductions in our active nutrition unit due to the sale of american body building and science foods 
the adoption of sfas no 
and the sale of american body building and science foods resulted in the fiscal decrease in amortization expense for the active nutrition and haleko business units 
other expense 
other expense  net  was million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal in may  we restructured our domestic credit facilities 
we paid off million in subordinated loan debt and accelerated amortization of outstanding senior term loans 
these modifications resulted in the fiscal write off of million in previously capitalized financing fees  including original issue discount oid costs 
in november  we paid off the remaining million in subordinated loan debt with borrowings available from our senior bank credit facility  resulting in an additional fiscal write off of million in similar fees and oid costs 
interest expense decreased due to an overall lower effective borrowing rate on less total indebtedness 
aggregate debt decreased appr oximately million to million at may   from approximately million at may  furthermore  other expense  net  increased in fiscal due to provisions for potentially unrealizable interest accrued on notes receivable and decreased in fiscal due to income on the sale of certain available for sale equity securities 
provision for income taxes 
provision for income taxes was a million expense for fiscal  compared to a million benefit for fiscal the increase resulted primarily from the increase in pre tax earnings partially offset by the net effect of tax rate differences for our domestic and international operations 
in addition  we did not recognize income tax benefits on international based losses for fiscal liquidity and capital resources working capital increased million to approximately million at may   from million at may  the increase in working capital resulted primarily from an increase in receivables and decreases in accounts payable and current portion of long term debt  partially offset by the may sale of our venice beach sports apparel business 
the increase in receivables resulted primarily from higher sales in the fiscal fourth quarter  as compared to the fiscal fourth quarter  an increase in refundable income taxes and the impact of foreign currency exchange rates 
the decrease in accounts payable resulted primarily from adjustments in payment terms with a certain supplier  including taking advantage of discounts offered for early payment 
effective june   we were party to a senior credit facility the credit facility with bankers trust company on behalf of our domestic subsidiaries 
the credit facility  as subsequently amended  was comprised of a million revolving loan 
under the revolving loan  we were able to borrow up to the lesser of million or the sum of i of eligible accounts receivable and ii the lesser of million or of the eligible inventory 
the credit facility contained customary terms and conditions  including  among others  financial covenants regarding minimum cash flows and limitations on indebtedness and our ability to pay dividends under certain circumstances 
our obligations under the credit facility were secured by a first priority lien on all owned or acquired tangible and intangible assets of our domestic subsidiaries 
the credit facility was being used to fund our normal working capital and capital expenditure requirements 
at may   available revolving loan funds were approximately million 
the credit facility was terminated on june  in favor of a new credit facility discussed below 
our domestic operations were also supported by a subordinated loan the subordinated loan obtained in conjunction with the credit facility 
effective may   we used funds available under our revolving loan to pay down million of the subordinated loan 
effective november   we used funds available under our revolving loan to pay off the remaining million of the subordinated loan 
on june   we entered into  through our wholly owned direct operating subsidiary weider nutrition group  inc wng  a new million revolving credit facility the new credit facility with keybank national association  as agent 
the new credit facility contains customary terms and conditions  including  among others  financial covenants and certain restrictions 
our obligations under the new credit facility are secured by a first priority security interest on all of the capital stock of wng 
if our total coverage ratio exceeds a certain amount  our obligations will also be secured by a first priority security interest in all of our domestic assets 
in the event we exceed certain other ratios  we will be subject to a borrowing base and will be able to borrow up to the lesser of million or the sum of i of eligible accounts receivable and ii of eligible inventory 
borrowings under the new credit facility bear interest at floating rates and the new credit facility matures on june   with options for one year extensions under certain circumstances 
we anticipate that the new credit facility will be used to fund our normal working capital and capital expenditure requirements of the company  with availability to fund certain permitted strategic transactions 
at the inception of the new credit facility  no amounts were outstanding 
our european working capital needs primarily our haleko business unit are supported by a germany based secured credit facility the haleko facility that is subject to annual renewal in or around june 
our obligations under the haleko facility are secured by a first priority lien on substantially all haleko tangible and intangible assets 
at may   amounts outstanding under the haleko facility were approximately million and available revolving loan funds were approximately million 
net proceeds from the fiscal first quarter sale of our venice beach sports apparel business were used to repay a portion of our outstanding indebtedness under the haleko facility 
in july  we renewed the haleko facility with deutsche bank ag in the approximate amount of million at recent exchange rates on terms sub stantially similar to the previous facility 
we believe that our cash  cash flows from operations and the financing sources discussed above will be sufficient to meet our normal cash operating requirements during the next twelve months 
however  we continue to review opportunities to acquire or invest in companies  product rights and other investments that are compatible with our existing business 
we could use cash and financing sources discussed herein  or financing sources that subsequently become available  to fund additional acquisitions or investments 
in addition  we may consider issuing additional debt or equity securities in the future to fund potential acquisitions or growth  or to refinance existing debt 
if a material acquisition or investment is completed  our operating results and financial condition could change materially in future periods 
however  no assura nce can be given that additional funds will be available on satisfactory terms  or at all  to fund such activities 
our board of directors will determine dividend policy in the future based upon  among other factors  results of operations  financial condition  contractual restrictions  and other factors deemed relevant at the time 
in addition  our credit facilities contain certain customary financial covenants that may limit our ability to pay common stock dividends 
we can give no assurance that we will pay dividends in the future 
a summary of our outstanding contractual obligations at may  is as follows in thousands contractual cash obligations total amounts committed less than year years years after years long term debt operating leases purchase obligations total obligations critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we make assumptions  estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reported periods 
we periodically evaluate our estimates and judgments related to valuation of inventories and intangible assets  allowances for doubtful accounts  notes receivable and sales returns  valuation of deferred tax assets and recoverability of long lived assets 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the accounting policies governing each of these matters 
our estimates are based on historical experience and on our future expectations that are believed to be reasonable 
the combinati on of these factors forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from our current estimates and those differences may be material 
we believe the following accounting policies affect some of our more significant estimates and judgments used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements we provide an inventory reserve for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs would be required 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts  notes receivable  sales returns and discounts for estimated losses resulting from known customer exposures  including product returns and inability to make payments 
we also consider collateral values and other factors in evaluating collectability of notes receivable 
actual results may differ resulting in adjustment of the respective allowance s 
we currently have deferred tax assets resulting from certain loss carry forwards and other temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting 
these deferred tax assets are subject to periodic recoverability assessments 
the realization of these deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future operating results 
to the extent we are uncertain whether future operations will generate sufficient profit to utilize the loss carry forwards  valuation allowances are established 
we have significant intangible assets  including trademarks  patents and goodwill 
the determination of related estimated useful lives and whether or not these assets are impaired involves significant judgments 
changes in strategy or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require adjustments to recorded asset balances 
impact of inflation historically  we have been able to pass inflationary increases for raw materials and other costs onto our customers through price increases and we anticipate that we will be able to continue to do so in the future 
seasonality our business can be seasonal  with fluctuations in sales resulting from timing of marketing and promotional activities  customer buying patterns and consumer spending patterns 
in addition  as a result of changes in product sales mix and other factors  as discussed above  we experience fluctuations in gross profit and operating margins on a quarter to quarter basis
