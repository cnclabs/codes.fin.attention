item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we develop  manufacture and in some cases distribute server appliance solutions that enable network equipment providers and independent software vendors  or isvs  to deliver data storage and security networking applications on server appliances 
server appliances are pre configured network infrastructure devices designed to deliver specific application functionality 
the server appliance is sold and supported by the network equipment or isv partner in our oem appliance segment  or by us through our distribution operation 
during fiscal years and  we also distributed third party data storage networking products  primarily fibre channel host bus adapters  or hbas  and network security products to our customer base of value added resellers  or vars  and systems integrators 
however  in october we decided to cease selling these third party data storage networking products 
this decision was based on a review of this portion of the business and its prospects 
as a result of the commoditization of the fibre channel hba technology and increasing competition in the market  we have experienced declining gross profits from sales of these products 
furthermore  future net revenues and gross profits in this portion of the business were expected to deteriorate 
we believe this decision will enable us to focus our remaining distribution sales  marketing  and support infrastructure on the sale of our ns series firewall appliances powered by microsoft internet security and acceleration isa server our new ns series firewall appliances were not available for sale until the first quarter of fiscal year we are currently organized into two reportable segments oem appliance and distribution 
oem appliance operations our oem appliance operation leverages our server appliance development  manufacturing and supply chain services 
we design  produce  and fulfill devices branded for our network equipment and isv partners  and we derive our revenues from the sale of value added hardware platforms and certain services to these partners 
these partners subsequently market  sell and support the server appliance under their own brands to their customer base 
during the years ended september  and  sales to emc represented and  respectively  of our oem appliance segment revenues 
on july   we were notified by emc that we were selected to develop a server appliance hardware platform for a future version of emc s centera product 
this selection continues our relationship with the emc centera program  which began in july of based on this selection  we have and will continue to incur increased research and development expenses related to this project 
distribution operations revenues from our distribution operations have been derived from two activities first is the revenue derived from the distribution of third party products and components  primarily related to data storage area networking  second is the distribution of server appliances that we develop  manufacture  sell and support based on our isv partners software applications 
third party data storage product revenues 
to date  substantially all of our distribution operations revenue has been derived from the sale of third party data storage networking components and products  predominantly emc approved fibre channel hbas 
we have been one of two authorized distributors in north america for fibre channel hbas that have been approved by emc  although other companies have been permitted by emc to sell such hbas and emc sells such hbas itself 
we were also a distributor of standard fibre channel hbas  network switches and other storage area networking products 
during the years ended september  and  sales of these third party data storage networking products represented of our distribution segment revenues 
in december  we amended our distribution agreement with emc regarding our sales of emc approved fibre channel hbas 
this amendment was effective january  and required that we pay a royalty to emc for each emc approved fibre channel hba that we sell 
as a result of this amendment  there has been a decline in our gross profits related to sales of emc approved fibre channel hbas  which in turn has had a negative impact on our distribution segment gross profits as well as our consolidated gross profits and operating results 
in addition  as a result of the higher costs per emc approved fibre channel hba that this amendment imposed upon us  our distribution segment s ability to compete in large sales transactions involving emc approved fibre channel hbas has been negatively affected 
for the years ended september  and  sales of emc approved fibre channel hbas represented and  respectively  of our distribution segment revenues 
based on our october decision to discontinue sales of third party data storage networking connectivity products  we expect that distribution net revenues in fiscal will decline significantly 
after we discontinue sales of third party data storage networking products in the quarter ending december   our distribution segment revenues will consist primarily of sales of our ns series firewall appliances 
server appliance revenues 
during fiscal year we began to recognize revenue derived from the sale and support of server appliances we have developed in conjunction with certain of our isv partners 
in this case  we are acting as a value added distributor for the isv  distributing the isv s software in the form of a server appliance  and acting as the point of sale and support for the device 
we have also developed our ns firewall appliance by licensing microsoft s internet security and acceleration isa server software application  however sales of these servers did not commence until fiscal year we expect that the sale of our ns series firewall appliances will be the primary source of our future distribution revenues after we discontinue the sale of our third party data storage networking products 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  allowances for doubtful accounts and sales returns  inventory valuation  product warranty obligations  acquisition accounting  goodwill  intangible assets and long lived assets  restructuring and other charges  stock compensation expense  and income tax asset valuation 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition revenues from products are generally recognized upon delivery to customers if persuasive evidence of the arrangement has been received  the sales price is fixed or determinable  collectibility of the related receivable is reasonably assured and title and risk of loss have passed to the customer 
we have an inventory consignment agreement with our largest customer related to certain server appliances sold through our oem appliance segment 
this customer notifies us when it utilizes inventory and we recognize revenues from sales to this customer based upon these notifications 
contracts and customer purchase orders are generally used to determine the existence of an arrangement 
shipping documents and consignment usage notifications are used to verify shipment or transfer of ownership  as applicable 
we assess whether the sales price is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment 
we assess collectibility based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis  as well as the customer s payment history 
for revenue arrangements that contain multiple elements  such as the sale of both the product and post sales support  in which software is not incidental to the product  such as our sales of server appliances through our distribution segment  we determine fair value based upon vendor specific objective evidence  which is typically established through contractual post sales support renewal rates whereby the residual fair value is allocated to the server appliance 
for revenue arrangements that contain multiple elements  in which software is not included or is incidental to the product  such as our sales of server appliances through our oem appliance segment  we determine fair value based on objective and reliable evidence of fair value  which is typically determined through stand alone sales of post sales support and competitive market analyses whereby the residual fair value is allocated to the server appliance 
we recognize revenue when the revenue recognition criteria for each element of the sale is met 
if we are not able to derive the fair value of each element of the sale  all revenues from the arrangement are deferred and recognized ratably over the period of the support arrangement  which is typically one to three years 
for post sales support services  revenue is recognized ratably over the period in which the services are performed 
allowances for doubtful accounts and sales returns our allowance for doubtful accounts as of september  was  compared with  as of september  this decrease in our allowance is primarily a result of write offs of approximately  the allowance is based on our assessment of the collectibility of customer accounts 
we regularly review the allowance by considering factors such as historical experience  credit quality  age of the accounts receivable balances  and current economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay 
if a major customer s creditworthiness deteriorates  or if actual defaults are higher than our historical experience  or if other circumstances arise  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could be overstated  and additional allowances could be required  which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
as of september  and september   receivables from emc represented and  respectively  of our accounts receivable 
our distribution segment customers have been offered a thirty day right of return on un opened third party data storage networking products 
a reserve for sales returns is established based on historical trends in product return rates 
the reserve for sales returns as of september  and was  and  respectively  for estimated future returns that were recorded as a reduction of our revenues and accounts receivable 
if the actual future returns were to deviate from the historical data on which the reserve had been established  our revenues could be adversely affected 
inventories we value our inventory at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a write down for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand and anticipated production requirements in the near future 
our inventory write downs balance as of september  was million  compared with million as of september  any rapid technological changes or significant changes in our future server appliance product development strategy could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand 
agreements with certain suppliers of our third party data storage networking products include stock rotation provisions for certain products and agreements with certain of our oem appliance customers include inventory protection provisions  however  these provisions may not provide us with complete protection from loss due to excess or obsolete inventory 
we do not have inventory stock rotation rights on emc approved fibre channel hbas 
as a result  we considered the implications of this in connection with our decision to discontinue sales of third party data storage networking products in order to estimate the required write down for excess inventory on hand 
at september  we had approximately million of inventory related to these third party data storage networking products  after write downs for excess and obsolescence 
in the past  we have had substantial write downs due to excess and obsolete inventory  which was primarily related to internally developed products 
our current products include more standards based technologies  which may help to mitigate our inventory obsolescence risk 
however  if there were to be a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products  or if there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements  we could be required to increase our inventory write downs and our gross profit could be adversely effected 
inventory management remains an area of focus as we balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels to ensure competitive lead times versus the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements 
product warranty obligations we offer a warranty on certain of our products that generally provide for us to repair or replace any defective products for a period of up to months after shipment 
we reserve for the estimated costs to fulfill customer warranty obligations upon the recognition of the related revenue and record warranty expense as a component of cost of sales 
oem server appliance products as of september   our server appliance product warranty obligations were  versus  as of september  costs included in our server appliance product warranty obligation include shipping  materials  internal and external labor  external testing costs and travel 
significant judgment and estimates are involved in estimating our warranty reserve on our server appliance products 
although our current server appliance products use more standards based technologies than in the past  certain of our server appliance products incorporate proprietary technologies  which may increase our risks related to product warranty obligations 
in the past we have experienced unexpected component failures in certain of our server appliance products  which have required us to increase our product warranty accruals 
at the time any unexpected component failure arises  we assess the costs to repair any defects and record what we believe to be an appropriate warranty obligation based on the available information at the time 
to the extent we may experience increased warranty claim activity  increased costs associated with servicing those claims  or use estimates that prove to be materially different from actual claims  our product warranty obligations may need to be increased  resulting in decreased gross profits 
hba products our hba warranty expense is determined based upon contractual rates with a third party warranty provider who we pay to perform substantially all activities related to the fulfillment of our hba product warranty obligations 
as such  the warranty expense that we have recognized for current and past shipments is fixed and is not subject to change 
as of september   our payable to this warranty provider for our hba product warranty obligations was  versus  as of september  the current term of our agreement with this third party warranty provider expires in march as a result of our decision to discontinue sales of third party data storage networking products  the volume of activity under this agreement is expected to significantly decline and may be eliminated entirely 
additionally  although we will no longer sell third party data storage networking products after the quarter ending december   the terms of our contract require a fixed payment to be made for the quarter ending march  since we will not receive any benefit associated with this fixed fee  this cost will be accrued during the quarter ending december  ns series firewall appliance products our ns series firewall appliances will not include a general warranty  but instead customers will be required to purchase an annual warranty maintenance program at the time of the appliance purchase 
business combinations and purchase price allocation in december  we acquired tidalwire for total consideration of million  which was allocated to net tangible assets and liabilities acquired of million  deferred stock compensation of  intangible assets of million and goodwill of million see note and note to our condensed consolidated financial statements 
the fair value of the intangible assets as of the date of the acquisition was determined based on the discounted estimated future cash flows from sales resulting primarily from our distribution agreement with emc regarding our sales of emc approved fibre channel hbas 
we had estimated that the useful life of these intangible assets would be five years 
significant judgments and estimates were involved in determining the fair value of the assets acquired and their estimated useful lives 
different assumptions could have yielded materially different results 
goodwill  intangible assets and long lived assets intangible assets acquired in a business combination are recorded under the purchase method of accounting at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 
the fair values of acquired intangible assets are determined by independent appraisers using information and assumptions provided by us 
goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
we review intangible assets at least annually to determine if any adverse conditions exist that would indicate impairment 
conditions that would trigger a more frequent impairment assessment include  but are not limited to  a significant adverse change in certain agreements  or business climate that could affect the value of an asset 
we assess the recoverability of long lived assets  including intangible assets  based on the projected undiscounted future cash flows over the asset s remaining life 
the amount of impairment  if any  is measured based on the excess of the carrying value over fair value 
fair value is generally calculated as the present value of estimated future cash flows using a risk adjusted discount rate  which requires significant management judgment with respect to revenue and expense growth rates  and the selection and use of an appropriate discount rate 
intangible assets were primarily attributable to our distribution agreement with emc regarding our sales of emc approved fibre channel hbas 
during the year ended september   we determined that our intangible assets were fully impaired resulting in an impairment charge to operations during the year of million 
this impairment was a result of the renegotiation of the emc agreement in december  and the future prospects of this portion of our distribution business see note of our consolidated financial statements 
prior to these assets being reduced to zero  they were being amortized over their estimated useful life of five years 
goodwill is reviewed each year in the fourth quarter for impairment  or more frequently if certain indicators are present 
examples of such indicators that would cause us to test goodwill for impairment between annual tests include  but are not limited to a significant adverse change in the business climate  unanticipated competition  or a loss of key personnel 
we performed two evaluations of our goodwill for impairment during fiscal one of these assessments was performed in connection with the amendment of our distribution agreement with emc  as described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
the second assessment was our annual evaluation made during the fourth quarter of fiscal when conducting our impairment evaluation  we compare the carrying value of the reporting unit  as defined  to the fair value of the reporting unit 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  then the carrying value of that reporting unit s goodwill is compared to the implied fair value of the goodwill and an impairment loss is recorded in an amount equal to that excess  if any 
we have not performed the second step of the impairment test because the fair value of the reporting unit has exceeded the carrying value 
fair value is calculated as the present value of estimated future cash flows using a risk adjusted discount rate  and includes significant judgments by management 
we believe that the most significant judgments involved in the determination of the fair value of our goodwill is our expectation of future revenues and gross profits from our sales of server appliances through our distribution segment 
we have a limited history selling server appliances through our distribution segment 
different assumptions utilized in the determination of the fair value of our goodwill could yield materially different results 
as of september  and our goodwill was million  which is attributable to synergies we expect to realize through our sales of server appliances through the distribution infrastructure acquired in our acquisition of tidalwire 
restructuring and other charges charges taken for vacant facilities are recognized when the available information indicates that a loss is probable and estimable 
during fiscal we recorded a charge to operations of  related to the vacancy of certain leased office space 
subsequently in fiscal  we received  of sublease income not previously anticipated and  as a result  reversed  of this charge 
also in fiscal  based on an amendment to our lease agreement and revised estimates of the future vacancy of certain leased facilities we reversed an additional  of this charge 
in may  our landlord authorized us to expand the production area of our leased facilities 
management subsequently approved and initiated a plan to utilize leased space that was previously unoccupied 
as a result  we reversed the remaining restructuring accrual balance of  in the three months ended june  as a result of our expansion into previously unoccupied lease space  we are recognizing approximately  of additional operating expenses on a quarterly basis 
as of september   our accrual for restructuring and other charges was versus  as of september  stock compensation in connection with the grant of certain options and restricted stock awards to employees issued prior to our initial public offering in july  we recorded deferred stock compensation within stockholders equity of million  representing the difference between the estimated fair value of the common stock for accounting purposes and the option exercise price of these options or restricted stock awards at the date of grant 
such amount is presented as a reduction of stockholders equity and has been amortized over the vesting period of the applicable options 
significant judgments and estimates were involved in determining the proper valuation of deferred stock compensation because at the time of grant there was no available market for our common stock 
different assumptions could have yielded materially different results 
during the year ended september  we granted  options to a non employee 
we accounted for these options at their fair value and recorded an immaterial amount of compensation expense during the year 
because the accounting for these options is based on fair value and subject to adjustment in each reporting period until vested  compensation expense in future periods could be materially different 
income tax asset valuation we record deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the net tax effects of tax credits  operating loss carryforwards and temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
we then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimate of future taxable income and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
at september   we believe that it is more likely than not that all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized  and  accordingly  we have recorded a valuation allowance against all of our deferred tax assets 
if results of operations in the future indicate that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be recovered  the reduction of the valuation allowance will be recorded as a tax benefit or credited to additional paid in capital to the extent of million during one period or over several periods 
comparability of financial information on december   we completed our acquisition of tidalwire 
as a result  the three months ended march  was the first quarter that included the tidalwire operations in our consolidated results for an entire quarter 
our financial results only include tidalwire financial results for periods subsequent to december  as such  the presentation of historical financial information and any discussion regarding the comparison of historical financial information does not include any financial information for tidalwire prior to december   unless otherwise indicated 
results of operations the following data summarizes the results of our operations for the past three fiscal years  in thousands and as a percentage of net revenues 
fiscal year ended september  amount of net revenues amount of net revenues amount of net revenues net revenues    gross profit    operating expenses    loss from operations    net loss    discussion of fiscal and net revenues and gross profit the following table summarizes our net revenues and gross profit by reportable segment  in thousands and as a percentage of net revenues fiscal year ended september  increase decrease amount of net revenues amount of net revenues dollars percentage oem appliance net revenues    gross profit    distribution net revenues    gross profit   total net revenues    total gross profit    net revenues in april  our largest oem appliance customer  emc  announced the availability of a product that incorporates one of our customized platforms 
since then  sales of that product have been a major portion of our net revenues 
after our acquisition of tidalwire in fiscal  we also distributed third party data storage networking connectivity products  consisting primarily of emc approved fibre channel hbas  through a channel of vars and systems integrators 
the increase in net revenues from fiscal to fiscal is due primarily to increased oem appliance sales to emc and increased distribution sales as a result of a full year of sales related to third party data storage networking products 
our oem appliance segment net revenues increased for fiscal primarily due to an increase in sales volumes to emc  which represented of oem appliance net revenues in the fiscal versus fiscal additionally  net revenues to oem appliance customers other than emc have grown from million in fiscal to million in fiscal approximately million of the increase is the result of net revenue growth among pre existing oem appliance customers and approximately million of this increase is attributable to revenues from new oem appliance customers added in the past year 
sales of third party data storage networking products represented of our distribution segment net revenues for fiscal and the increase in net revenues in from was the result of an entire year of distribution sales in fiscal from our acquisition of tidalwire on december  compared to only nine months of sales in fiscal additionally  sales volumes of hbas were higher  which were offset in part by a decrease in the average sales prices 
based on our october decision to discontinue sales of third party data storage networking connectivity products  we expect that distribution net revenues in fiscal will decline significantly 
after we discontinue sales of third party data storage networking products in the quarter ending december   our distribution segment revenues will consist primarily of sales of our ns series firewall appliances that we introduced in october the first ns series appliance became generally available in october  therefore we expect that it will take several quarters before revenues from these appliances would become significant 
gross profit gross profit represents net revenues recognized less the cost of revenues 
cost of revenues includes cost of materials  manufacturing costs  warranty costs  inventory obsolescence write downs and shipping and handling costs 
in addition  for internally manufactured server appliance products  cost of revenues includes compensation and related expenses for our manufacturing personnel 
the increase in gross profit in our oem appliance segment is due primarily to growth in our oem appliance sales volumes 
as a percentage of net revenues  gross profit in our oem appliance segment has declined due primarily to higher discounting to certain customers as a result of volume increases and due to higher inventory obsolescence write downs 
the decrease in our gross profit as a percentage of oem appliance net revenues was offset in part by lower manufacturing costs per unit sold due to volume efficiencies and related manufacturing process improvements and lower warranty costs 
the increase in our distribution segment gross profit is due primarily to the growth of distribution net revenues 
as a percentage of net revenues  gross profit in our distribution segment has declined primarily due to royalty costs incurred in as a result of our amended agreement with emc regarding our distribution of emc approved fibre channel hbas  which was effective january  to a lesser extent  the decreases in gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of distribution segment net revenues are due to lower average selling prices as well as changes to the mix of products sold through our distribution segment 
our gross profit is affected by the product mix within our oem appliance business  our oem appliance product pricing as well as the timing  size and configuration of server appliance orders 
oem appliance gross profit is also affected by the mix of product manufactured internally compared to product manufactured by our contract manufacturer  which carries higher manufacturing costs 
our gross profit is also affected by the relative size of distribution revenues to oem appliance revenues 
based on our october decision to discontinue selling third party data storage networking products  we expect that oem appliance net revenues will make up a higher percentage of consolidated net revenues in fiscal we expect gross profit to continue to be affected by these factors as well as competitive pricing pressure in both the oem appliance and distribution segments  in particular as we begin to sell our new firewall appliances in an already competitive marketplace 
we expect that the gross margins as a percentage of revenue on our firewall appliances will initially be significantly influenced by promotional activities targeted at achieving market acceptance of these products 
operating expenses the most significant components of our operating expenses are research and development  selling and marketing  and general and administrative expenses 
the following table presents operating expenses during the periods indicated  in thousands and as a percentage of net revenues fiscal year ended september  increase decrease amount of net revenues amount of net revenues dollars percentage operating expenses research and development    selling and marketing    general and administrative   stock compensation restructuring and other charges credits impairment of intangible assets   amortization of intangible assets total operating expenses    research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel engaged in research and development  fees paid to consultants and outside service providers  material costs for prototype and test units and other expenses related to the design  development  testing and enhancements of our server appliance products 
we expense all of our research and development costs as they are incurred 
the following table summarizes the most significant components of research and development expense for the periods indicated  in thousands and as a percentage of total research and development expense and provides the changes in thousands and percentages fiscal year ended september  increase decrease dollars of expense category dollars of expense category dollars percentage research and development compensation and related    prototype   consulting and outside services other total research and development   during the past year  our server appliance development expenses have increased as a result of an increase in the development and sustaining engineering efforts related to existing  new and prospective isv and network equipment partners and increased software development activities related to our ns series firewall appliance 
in particular  we incurred substantial development costs during the fourth quarter of relating to the development of a server appliance hardware platform for a future version emc s centera product 
to support these and other development activities related to our ns series firewall appliances we have increased our research and development personnel from at september  to at september   which has resulted in increased compensation costs 
we have also increased the number of consultants used to supplement our research and development personnel levels  primarily in the area of software and to a lesser extent hardware development  which has resulted in increased consulting and outside service costs 
our server appliance development strategy emphasizes the utilization of standard  off the shelf components in our server appliance platforms 
however  we expect that in some cases significant development efforts will be required to fulfill our current and potential isv and network equipment partners needs 
in addition  we intend to focus our software development in areas that improve the ease of server appliance implementation and use  which we believe will enhance our value proposition 
we expect that prototype and consulting costs will be variable and could fluctuate depending on the timing and magnitude of our server appliance development projects 
as a result of the factors described above  we expect that research and development expenses will increase in fiscal selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and commissions for personnel engaged in sales and marketing  costs associated with our marketing programs  which include costs associated with our attendance at trade shows  public relations  product literature costs  web site enhancements and product evaluation costs  consulting costs and travel 
the following table summarizes the most significant components of selling and marketing expense for the periods indicated in thousands and as a percentage of total selling and marketing expense and provides the changes in thousands and percentages fiscal year ended september  increase decrease dollars of expense category dollars of expense category dollars percentage selling and marketing compensation and related    marketing programs consulting travel other total selling and marketing    as a result of our acquisition of tidalwire on december   we increased our selling and marketing personnel and our marketing program activities increased 
our distribution segment by its nature incurs more of the marketing and sales burden of the products that it sells and must engage in a higher level of marketing program activities than our oem appliance segment 
sales in our oem appliance segment are to our isv and network equipment partners who market and sell their products  which incorporate our server appliances 
as a result  our oem appliance segment engages in a limited level of marketing programs 
however  we have increased certain of our marketing program activities in an effort to further establish our presence in the server appliance market 
as indicated in the table above  the primary components of the increase in selling and marketing expenses are compensation and marketing program costs 
primarily as a result of our acquisition of tidalwire on december   our selling and marketing personnel increased from prior to this acquisition  to at september  the increases in compensation are primarily due to the effect of an entire fiscal year of expenses related to these personnel additions compared to approximately nine months in fiscal similarly  the increase in marketing program costs is due to the effect of an entire fiscal year of marketing program activities related to our distribution segment compared to a partial year in recently  marketing program costs have increased related to activities related to our ns series firewall server appliances 
we believe that we must continue our selling and marketing efforts in order to enhance our position as a leading provider of server appliance products and to establish ourselves as a leader in network security appliances 
variable marketing costs  such as marketing programs  are somewhat dependent on the timing and magnitude of new product introductions and will fluctuate depending on the level of this activity 
we expect significant increases in selling and marketing expenses in fiscal in an effort to gain recognition in the market for our new ns series firewall appliances and continue to expand our sales and marketing efforts to further increase our market presence and grow our revenues 
these increases will be partially offset by decreases in our sales and marketing expenses related to third party data storage networking products  which we will no longer sell after the first quarter of fiscal general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs for executive  finance  accounting  information technology and human resources personnel  professional services  which include legal  accounting  audit and tax fees  director and officer insurance  and bad debt expenses 
the following table summarizes the most significant components of general and administrative expense for the periods indicated in thousands and as a percentage of total general and administrative expense and provides the changes in thousands and percentages fiscal year ended september  increase decrease dollars of expense category dollars of expense category dollars percentage general and administrative compensation and related   consulting and professional services   director and officer insurance bad debt expense other  total general and administrative   as indicated in the table above  the primary components of the increase in general and administrative expenses from fiscal to are increased compensation and increased consulting and professional service costs 
at september  we had employees in our general and administrative department compared to employees at september  the increase in professional services is due primarily to an increase in legal and accounting costs related to certain non recurring projects  increased compliance costs and overall growth 
our director and officer insurance costs  which are related to premiums associated with insurance coverage that we provide on behalf of our directors and officers  have increased from the past year due to enhanced coverage 
we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in fiscal depending on costs associated with ongoing litigation and increased costs related to operating as a public company  including compliance with the requirement of the sarbanes oxley act 
stock compensation 
we recorded deferred stock compensation on our balance sheet of million in connection with stock option and restricted stock grants to our employees and directors that were granted between february  and june  this amount represents the difference between the exercise price and the deemed fair value of our common stock for financial reporting purposes at the date of grant 
we have amortized this stock compensation over the vesting period of the related options 
all options granted subsequent to june  have been issued with exercise prices equal to the fair market value of our common stock and  accordingly  no additional deferred compensation has been recorded 
through september   we amortized million to stock compensation expense and million of deferred stock compensation has been reversed due to the cancellation of options for terminated employees 
in connection with our acquisition of tidalwire  we assumed all of tidalwire s outstanding options  which converted into options to purchase  shares of our common stock 
we recorded approximately  of deferred stock compensation on our balance sheet related to unvested options 
this amount represents the difference between the exercise prices and the fair market value of our common stock on the option conversion date 
we are amortizing this deferred stock compensation over the remaining vesting period of the related options 
through september   we amortized  to stock compensation expense and  of deferred stock compensation has been reversed due to the cancellation of options for terminated employees 
the remaining deferred stock compensation of  at september  will be amortized during the quarter ending december  restructuring and other charges 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we recorded a charge to operations of  this charge was comprised entirely of future lease and lease related payments and resulted from the continued vacancy of certain leased facilities and the expected future vacancy of certain leased facilities that were occupied by a sub tenant 
we determined the amount of this charge through an analysis of the real estate market in and around these facilities  the likelihood that these facilities could be sub leased during the remainder of the existing lease terms and the financial condition of the sub tenant 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we received  of sublease income not previously anticipated and  as a result  reversed  of this charge 
this charge was later revised resulting in a reversal of  in the fourth quarter of fiscal in may  our landlord authorized us to expand the production area of our leased facilities 
subsequently  our management approved and initiated a plan to utilize leased space that was previously unoccupied 
as a result  we reversed the remaining restructuring accrual balance of  during fiscal amortization and impairment of intangible assets 
in connection with our acquisition of tidalwire in december  we engaged a third party valuation firm to evaluate the intangible assets generated as a result of the acquisition 
as a result of this valuation work  we recorded approximately million of intangible assets attributable to tidalwire s existing customer relationships as of december  we estimated the useful life of the relationships to be five years and as such  we were amortizing the related intangible assets on a straight line basis over five years 
on december   we amended our agreement with emc regarding our distribution of emc approved fibre channel hbas  effective january  because of this amendment  we were required to pay a royalty for each emc approved fibre channel hba sold by us beginning in the quarter ended march  as a result  our gross profits from sales of emc approved fibre channel hbas were lower than originally expected 
because of the negative impact of this amendment on our operating results  we considered this amendment to be a triggering event requiring an impairment evaluation of our intangible assets 
as a result  we conducted a detailed analysis of our intangible assets as of december  this analysis resulted in the determination that the fair value of our intangible assets  which is primarily attributable to our distribution agreement with emc regarding emc approved fibre channel hbas  was less than its carrying amount  which resulted in a charge to operations of approximately million in the quarter ended december  as a result of this reduction in the carrying value of the asset  amortization expense decreased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal we also performed an impairment evaluation of the remaining carrying value of these intangible assets at september  this analysis resulted in the remaining carrying value exceeding the fair value and therefore an impairment charge to operations of  resulting in a total impairment charge to operations during the year ended september  of million 
interest and other income expense  net interest and other income expense  net has decreased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal this decrease was primarily due to lower average interest rates earned on our cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments 
discussion of fiscal and net revenues and gross profit the following table summarizes our net revenues and gross profit by reportable segment  in thousands and as a percentage of net revenues fiscal year ended september  increase decrease amount of net revenues amount of net revenues dollars percentage oem appliance net revenues    gross profit    distribution net revenues   gross profit   total net revenues    total gross profit    net revenues the increase in net revenues from fiscal to fiscal is due primarily to the addition of distribution sales as a result of our acquisition of tidalwire in december and due to increased oem appliance sales volumes to emc 
prior to the tidalwire acquisition  there were no distribution revenues 
sales to emc represented of our total net revenues and of our oem appliance revenues in fiscal compared to of our total net revenues and oem appliance revenues in fiscal gross profit the increase in gross profit in fiscal versus fiscal was primarily due to incremental revenues from the acquisition of tidalwire  and increased oem appliance sales volumes 
to a lesser extent  the increase in gross profit in fiscal was due to lower manufacturing costs per unit sold 
the increase in gross profit in fiscal was offset in part by significantly increased warranty costs associated with oem appliance revenues  resulting primarily from higher estimated costs to fulfill warranties and the increased sales volumes of server appliances 
operating expenses the most significant components of our operating expenses are research and development  selling and marketing  and general and administrative expenses 
the following table presents operating expenses during the periods indicated  in thousands and as a percentage of net revenues fiscal year ended september  increase decrease amount of net revenues amount of net revenues dollars percentage operating expenses research and development   selling and marketing    general and administrative    stock compensation   restructuring and other charges amortization of intangible assets total operating expenses   research and development 
the following table summarizes the most significant components of research and development expense for the periods indicated  in thousands and as a percentage of total research and development expense and provides the changes in thousands and percentages fiscal year ended september  increase decrease dollars of expense category dollars of expense category dollars percentage research and development compensation and related   prototype  consulting and outside services other  total research and development   research and development expenses decreased in fiscal versus fiscal due primarily to decreased compensation costs  which decreased as a result of our closure of our austin  texas software development center in december and our june headcount reduction 
these headcount reductions were a result of our transition away from the use of significant proprietary technology in our server appliance products 
we significantly increased the use of standard off the shelf technology in our server appliance products  which decreased our need for engineering personnel in our product design process 
prior to these headcount reductions  we had people in our engineering group 
at september   there were employees in our engineering group 
in addition  lower facility related expenses contributed to the decrease in research and development expenses in fiscal the decrease in research and development in fiscal was partially offset by increased prototype costs incurred in development projects for our oem appliance business 
selling and marketing 
the following table summarizes the most significant components of selling and marketing expense for the periods indicated in thousands and as a percentage of total selling and marketing expense and provides the changes in thousands and percentages fiscal year ended september  increase decrease dollars of expense category dollars of expense category dollars percentage selling and marketing compensation and related    marketing programs consulting travel other total selling and marketing    the increase in selling and marketing expenses in fiscal versus fiscal was due to increased compensation costs as sales  marketing  business development and customer support personnel increased from employees at september  to employees at september   which was primarily due to our acquisition of tidalwire in december general and administrative 
the following table summarizes the most significant components of general and administrative expense for the periods indicated in thousands and as a percentage of total general and administrative expense and provides the changes in thousands and percentages fiscal year ended september  increase decrease dollars of expense category dollars of expense category dollars percentage general and administrative compensation and related   consulting and professional services   director and officer insurance bad debt expense other   total general and administrative   the increase in general and administrative expenses in fiscal versus fiscal is primarily attributable to increased compensation costs as general and administrative personnel increased from at september  to at september   primarily due to our tidalwire acquisition 
the increase in general and administrative expenses in fiscal is also due to increased legal  audit and tax and insurance expenses due to the rising costs associated with our operation as a public company and our defense of a lawsuit related to our acquisition of tidalwire 
restructuring and other charges 
in june  in an effort to further streamline operations  we implemented a restructuring through which we reduced our workforce by employees  which impacted employees in all of our departments 
the implementation of this reduction in workforce resulted in a charge of  to operations  which was comprised entirely of employee related charges  including severance payments to terminated employees 
we believe this restructuring resulted in cost savings of approximately million in fiscal stock compensation 
the decrease in stock compensation expense in fiscal versus fiscal is due to the accelerated amortization of million of deferred stock compensation recorded in december as a result of our closure of our austin  texas development center and the termination of employee stockholders as a result of that facility closure 
amortization of intangible assets 
the increase in amortization expense of  from fiscal to fiscal is entirely the result of the amortization of the intangible assets we acquired in connection with our purchase of tidalwire during fiscal no such amortizable intangible assets existed during fiscal interest and other income expense  net interest and other income expense  net has decreased from million in fiscal to  in fiscal this decrease was due to lower average interest rates earned on our cash equivalents and lower average cash  cash equivalents and short term investments balances as a result of the utilization of cash and cash equivalents to fund our net operating losses and to fund our acquisition of tidalwire in december liquidity and capital resources the following table summarizes cash flow activities for the fiscal years ended in thousands september  net loss   non cash adjustments to net loss   changes in working capital   net cash provided by used in operating activities net cash used in investing activities   net cash provided by financing activities   increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year   cash and cash equivalents at end of year operating activities the increase in our net cash provided by operating activities from fiscal to is attributable to both an increase in non cash adjustments to net loss  and an increase as a result of changes in working capital 
the increase in non cash adjustments to reconcile net loss to net cash provided by operations was primarily attributable to our million intangible asset impairment offset by decreases of approximately  related to depreciation and amortization  and  related to stock compensation 
significant cash flow effects from working capital in fiscal included increased cash flow of million attributable to accounts receivable  inventories and prepaid expenses  and decreased cash flow of million attributable to accounts payable and accrued expenses 
the increased cash flow related to accounts receivable was primarily due to decreasing our days sales outstanding to days for fiscal versus days for fiscal our days sales outstanding could vary significantly due to possible quarterly fluctuations in the timing of shipments to and payments primarily from our large oem appliance customer 
the increased cash flow related to inventory is due to significantly lower inventory levels of third party storage networking products partially offset by higher oem appliance inventory 
during fiscal our inventory turnover rate was times per year versus times per year in fiscal our inventory balance is comprised entirely of current products and will tend to fluctuate based on the growth of our business  the timing of shipments to our large oem appliance customers 
we believe that it is important that we maintain sufficient inventory on hand to support the demands of our oem appliance partners 
these partners sales may be uneven during a particular quarter with large and unexpected increases or decreases 
to maintain our ability to deliver products when required by our partners  we carry a level of server appliance inventory that we believe to be adequate to compensate for some level of unanticipated increases in quarterly demand 
the increased cash flow related to prepaid expenses is due to a prepayment of certain insurance coverage in fiscal the decreased cash flow related to accounts payable and accrued expenses was primarily due to the timing of inventory purchases at the end of the fourth quarter 
based on our decision to discontinue sales of third party data storage networking products and focus on our line of firewall security appliances  we expect that we will use a significant amount of cash for operations in fiscal we will continue to make what we believe to be necessary working capital investments to continue to grow our business 
investing activities during fiscal  we purchased property and equipment of approximately million in support of the growth of our business 
we expect to continue to make investments in property and equipment in the future 
also during fiscal  we purchased approximately million of short term investments in an effort to realize higher returns on our available cash 
the most significant investing activity in fiscal was our acquisition of tidalwire  which used million of cash including million of transaction costs and was offset in part by the million of proceeds from sales of short term investments 
in addition  we have made significant investments in leasehold improvements in the past to expand our production capacity and build out our office space 
in may  we initiated a plan to make additional investments in leasehold improvements to further expand our production capacity and improve the efficiency of our production process 
this plan was completed at the end of june and we began utilizing our expanded production capacity in july we believe that our current facilities  along with our use of a contract manufacturer to supplement production  will be sufficient to support our business for the foreseeable future 
financing activities our financing activities since inception have been primarily from the sale of equity securities 
financing activities have been our principal source of cash since fiscal in july  we completed our initial public offering by selling a total of  shares of common stock at per share and raised approximately million  net of offering costs and underwriting fees totaling approximately million 
in addition to equity financing  we generated cash as a result of employee stock option and stock purchase plan activity of million in fiscal and  in fiscal although we expect employee stock option and stock purchase plan activity to continue in fiscal  we cannot predict its level given the volatility of capital markets 
the primary financing activity that we have engaged in that used cash was our million common stock repurchase program  which was approved by our board of directors in august our stock repurchase program authorized us to repurchase our common stock from time to time on the open market or in non solicited privately negotiated transactions 
we completed this program in fiscal when we repurchased  shares of our common stock for approximately  of cash 
as such  there were no repurchases during fiscal contractual obligations and commitments the following table sets forth certain information concerning our obligations and commitments to make certain payments in thousands 
payments due by period less than year years years after years total operating leases  purchase obligations total   our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including the timing and size of orders from our largest customer  the level of investment required for development and sales and marketing related to our ns series firewall appliances  our ability to enter into partnerships with value added resellers and system integrators and their ability to sell our ns series firewall appliances  our ability to market and sell our ns series firewall appliances  our ability to form an adequate number of partnerships with network equipment providers and isvs  the level of success of our oem appliance partners in selling server appliance solutions that include our server appliance hardware platforms  the costs and timing of product engineering efforts and the success of these efforts  the outcome of pending litigation  and market developments 
we believe that our available cash resources  including cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  and cash that we expect to generate from sales of our products will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital requirements through at least the next twelve months 
after that  we may need to raise additional funds 
we may in the future seek to raise additional funds through borrowings  public or private equity financings or from other sources 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available at all or  if available  will be on terms acceptable to us 
if additional financing is needed and is not available on acceptable terms  we may need to reduce our operating expenses 
off balance sheet arrangements we have not created  and are not party to  any special purpose or off balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital  incurring debt or operating parts of our business that are not consolidated into our financial statements 
we have not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby the company has subordinated retained interests  derivative instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose the company to material continuing risks  contingent liabilities  or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing  liquidity  market risk or credit risk support to the company 
related party transactions in january  we deposited million of cash with a bank to guarantee a personal loan of lawrence a 
genovesi  our current chairman and former president  chief executive office and chief technology officer 
this guarantee was made in order to avoid significant sales of our stock by mr 
genovesi as a result of a margin call on a personal loan collateralized by mr 
genovesi s holdings of our stock 
in conjunction with our guarantee of this loan  we entered into an agreement whereby mr 
genovesi agreed to reimburse us for any obligations incurred by us under the guarantee 
on january   the bank applied  of our funds that were on deposit with the bank in satisfaction of all amounts due to the bank from mr 
genovesi and refunded  to us 
on january   mr 
genovesi repaid us  to satisfy his obligations to us in full under the reimbursement agreement 
of that amount   was paid in cash and  was paid with the proceeds from the repurchase by us of  shares of our common stock owned by mr 
genovesi in a private transaction 
during fiscal year  we repurchased  shares of common stock held by mr 
genovesi at a cost of  of the purchase price   was applied against mr 
genovesi s outstanding loans due to us  while the remaining  was paid in cash to mr 
genovesi 
mr 
genovesi also repaid  due to us under his remaining outstanding loans 
on january   mr 
genovesi  repaid to us a recourse note payable of  with proceeds from our repurchase of  shares of our common stock owned by mr 
genovesi 
in april  we entered into five recourse loans with certain of our officers and employees at that time totaling approximately  we entered into these loan agreements to avoid substantial sales of our common stock by these individuals as a result of their alternative minimum tax obligations incurred as a result of their exercise of common stock options 
the loans had an interest rate of per year and were due  as amended  in september these officers and employees pledged to us all shares of our common stock owned by them  all common stock options held by them and all proceeds received by them on the sale of either our common stock or common stock options 
during fiscal year  we received proceeds from loans principal and interest payments of approximately  we repurchased  shares of common stock as repayment for principal and interest for an additional  in january  the remaining loans of approximately  were repaid in full  including accrued interest  through our repurchase of  shares of our common stock 
in connection with our acquisition of tidalwire  we paid  in cash to ascent venture partners and  in cash to harbourvest partners  two of our substantial stockholders at that time 
at the time of the acquisition  ascent and harbourvest owned approximately and of our outstanding common stock  respectively 
ascent and harbourvest also owned and of the outstanding common stock of tidalwire  respectively 
pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement  we issued  shares and  shares of our common stock previously held as treasury stock to ascent and harbourvest  respectively  and made the aforementioned cash payments to ascent and harbourvest in exchange for all of the tidalwire common stock held by ascent and harbourvest 
also in connection with the tidalwire acquisition  we engaged akibia  inc to provide certain customer support and warranty fulfillment services 
akibia charges us a fee for these services based upon sales of fibre channel hbas 
a director of ours is also a director of psi holding group  inc the parent company of akibia 
at the time this relationship was established  ascent and harbourvest each owned greater than of our outstanding stock and greater than of the outstanding stock of psi 
in the twelve months ended september  and  we recognized  and  respectively  of expense as a result of our agreements with akibia 
in connection with our customer service and warranty fulfillment services agreement with akibia  we sold product to akibia to allow akibia to fulfill our warranty obligations 
during fiscal and we recorded revenues of approximately  and  respectively 
in addition  tidalwire had certain agreements with akibia related to administrative and accounting services and leased certain facilities from akibia 
these agreements terminated in march payments related to these agreements by us during fiscal totaled  at september  and  we had amounts due to akibia of  and  respectively  and amounts receivable of  and  respectively 
additionally  during fiscal we engaged akibia for consulting services related to an upgrade of certain of our systems 
amounts paid to akibia during fiscal related to these services were approximately one of the company s former significant stockholders  owns approximately of the outstanding capital stock of network intelligence corporation 
network intelligence corporation has a contract with the company to purchase certain of its products 
in the fiscal years ending september   and  revenue from sales to network intelligence incorporation were approximately   and  respectively 
recent accounting pronouncements in may  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas 
sfas establishes standards for how an issuer of equity classifies and measures on its balance sheet certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may  and for existing financial instruments after october  the adoption of sfas did not have an impact on our financial position or our results of operation 
on december   the staff of the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition  which supersedes sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab s primary purpose is to rescind the accounting guidance contained in sab related to multiple element revenue arrangements that was superseded as a result of the issuance of eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
additionally  sab rescinds the sec s related revenue recognition in financial statements frequently asked questions and answers issued with sab that had been codified in sec topic  revenue recognition 
while the wording of sab has changed sab to reflect the issuance of eitf  the revenue recognition principles of sab remain largely unchanged by the issuance of sab  which was effective upon issuance 
our adoption of sab did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
factors that may affect future operating results the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we are faced with 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us  or that are currently deemed immaterial  may also impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected 
risks of dependence on one strategic partner 
we derive a significant portion of our revenues from sales of server appliances directly to emc through our oem appliance segment and our revenues may decline significantly if this customer cancels or delays purchases of our products  terminates its relationship with us  or exercises certain of its contractual rights 
in the years ended september  and  sales directly to emc  our largest customer  accounted for and of our total net revenues  and and of our oem appliance revenues  respectively 
based on our october decision to discontinue sales of third party data storage networking products we expect net revenues from our distribution segment to decline in fiscal as such  we believe that sales to this customer will make up a higher percentage of total net revenues in fiscal primarily all of these sales are attributable to one oem appliance product pursuant to a non exclusive contract 
we anticipate that our future operating results will continue to depend heavily on sales to  and our relationship with  this customer 
accordingly  the success of our business will depend  in large part  on this customer s willingness to continue to utilize our server appliance solutions in its existing and future products 
further  our financial success is dependent upon the future success of the products we sell to this customer and the continued growth  viability and financial stability of this customer  whose industry has experienced rapid technological change  short product life cycles  consolidation and pricing and margin pressures 
a significant reduction in sales to this customer  or significant pricing and margin pressures exerted on us by this customer  would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
in addition  if this customer delays or cancels purchases of our products  our operating results would be harmed and our ability to accurately predict revenues  profitability and cash flows would decrease 
on july   we were notified by emc that we were selected to develop a server appliance hardware platform for a future version of emc s centera product 
this selection continues our relationship with emc regarding its centera program  which began in july of based on this selection  we have and expect to continue to incur additional research and development expenses related to this project 
if we are unable to recover these product development costs through sales of this product to emc  our operating results will suffer 
under the terms of our non exclusive contract  this customer has the right to enter into agreements with third parties for similar products  is not obligated to purchase any minimum quantity of products from us and may choose to stop purchasing from us at any time  with or without cause 
in addition  this customer may terminate the agreement in the event that we attempt to assign our rights under the agreement to another party without this customer s prior approval 
furthermore  in the event that we default on certain portions of the agreement  this customer has the right to manufacture certain products in exchange for a mutually agreeable royalty fee 
if any of these events were to occur  or if this customer were to delay or discontinue purchases of our products  as a result of dissatisfaction or otherwise  our revenues and operating results would be materially adversely affected and our reputation in the industry might suffer and our ability to accurately predict revenues  profitability and cash flows would decrease 
risks related to business strategy 
our future success is dependent upon our ability to generate significant revenues from server appliance development relationships in our oem appliance segment 
a major component of our business strategy is to form server appliance development relationships with network equipment providers and isvs in our oem appliance segment 
under this strategy  we work with our partners to develop a server appliance  which is branded with the applicable partner s name and is sold through our oem appliance segment to the partner  who then performs all of the selling and marketing efforts related to further sales 
there are multiple risks associated with this strategy including the expenditure of significant product development costs  which if not recovered through server appliance sales  could negatively affect our operating results  a significant reliance on our partners application software products  which could be technologically inferior to competitive products and result in limitations on our server appliance sales causing our revenues and operating results to suffer  and our reliance on our partners to perform all of the selling and marketing efforts associated with further sales of the server appliance product we develop with them 
additionally  our future success will depend on our ability to expand sales of server appliances to our existing partners  as well as establishing relationships with new partners 
if these partners are unsuccessful in their marketing and sales efforts  or if we are unable to expand our sales to existing partners and develop relationships with new partners  our revenues and operating results could suffer 
if potential customers do not accept our ns series firewall appliances as a solution to certain of their network security needs  our business could be adversely affected 
we currently expect that future distribution segment revenues will be primarily generated through sales of our ns series firewall appliances and the related maintenance service  including subscription services  and we may not succeed if the market does not accept these products and services as a viable solution to certain network security needs 
our ns series firewall appliances are powered by microsoft s isa server software application 
if customers don t perceive this application to be technically superior to other competitive firewall products or if customers don t believe that our firewall appliance will provide increased security for microsoft applications  then our revenues and operating results will suffer 
the initial member of ns series line of firewall appliance products has only been available since october  and we may not be successful in marketing and selling this type of product 
if we are unable to educate and train customers on our new product line  we may not be successful in marketing and selling these new products 
sales of ns series firewall appliances through our distribution segment are expected to require a greater selling and marketing burden than any of our other server appliance products 
we may find the selling and marketing burden to be greater than was originally planned 
we have invested and plan to continue to invest in a significant level of engineering resources for the development of our ns series firewall appliances 
if we are unable to generate sufficient revenues to recover these costs and achieve an appropriate gross profit  our operating results will suffer 
in addition  we have limited experience in selling any server appliances through our distribution segment s sales channel of vars and systems integrators 
to date  we have been unable to achieve substantial sales of server appliances through our distribution segment and there is no guarantee that we will be able to achieve substantial amounts of such sales in the future 
if we are unable to generate sufficient revenues by leveraging our distribution operation to increase sales of server appliances in a cost effective and timely manner  our operating results may suffer and we may determine that we need to increase our investment in this business  thereby increasing our costs and lowering our profits  or we may determine that we must discontinue this component of our business strategy  any of which could negatively affect our business and result in an impairment of our goodwill 
if we fail to enter into partnerships with a significant number of new resellers and systems integrators capable of selling our ns series firewall appliances  our revenues and operating results may be adversely affected 
a key component of our business strategy is to focus our distribution business on our ns series firewall appliances 
to accomplish this  among other things  we must establish a network of vars and systems integrators that are familiar with the network security market 
our existing channel of vars and system integrators that we partnered with to sell third party data storage networking products are primarily focused on the data storage market 
although we may able to leverage some of these relationships for the sale of our firewall appliances  our strategy is to partner with microsoft certified vars and system integrators 
because we expect that these new relationships with microsoft certified vars and system integrators will be derived through working closely with microsoft s sales and marketing team  signing resellers will depend principally on our relationship with microsoft  and our ability to leverage that relationship to gain access to these vars and system integrators 
therefore  we will need to further establish and strengthen our relationship with microsoft in order to be considered a preferred provider of microsoft isa server in the form of an appliance 
if we fail to strengthen our relationship with microsoft enabling us to enter into partnerships with a significant number of new resellers and systems integrators  our revenues and operating results may be adversely affected 
in addition  we will need to train our reseller partners on the benefits of microsoft isa server and the added value of selling this application in the form of our ns series firewall appliance 
if we are not successful in training our resellers  our revenue growth may be limited and our operating results may be adversely affected 
we may be unable to deliver our products and services if we cannot continue to license third party technology that is essential for the functionality of our security appliances 
our success will significantly depend on our continued ability to license technology that is essential for the functionality of our security appliances 
a material adverse change in our relationship with microsoft or the functionality of its software could delay our development and sales until we can find  license and integrate suitable technology 
this could damage our brand and result in loss of current and potential customers 
we depend on microsoft to deliver reliable  high quality software  develop new software on a timely and cost effective basis and respond to evolving technology and changes in industry standards 
in the future  we may need to license technology from additional third parties that would be incorporated in our ns series appliances 
both our oem appliance and distribution segments could be harmed if we fail to adequately integrate new technologies into our server appliance products or if we invest in technologies that do not result in the desired effects on our current and or future product offerings 
as part of our strategy  we review opportunities to incorporate products and technologies that could be required in order to add new customers  retain existing customers  expand the breadth of product offerings or enhance our technical capabilities 
investing in new technologies presents numerous risks  including we may experience difficulties integrating new technologies into our current or future products  our new products may be delayed because selected new technologies themselves are delayed or have defects and or performance limitations  we may incorporate technologies that do not result in the desired improvements to our current and or future server appliance products  we may incorporate new technologies that either may not be desired by our customers or may not be compatible with our customer s existing technology  new technologies are unproven and could contain latent defects  which could result in high product failures  and we could find that the new products and or technologies that we choose to incorporate into our products are technologically inferior to those utilized by our competitors 
if we are unable to adequately integrate new technologies into our server appliance products or if we invest in technologies that do not result in the desired effects on our current and or future product offerings  our business could be harmed and operating results could suffer 
if we fail to retain and attract appropriate levels of qualified employees  we may not be able meet key objectives 
our success depends in large part on our ability to retain  and more importantly attract highly skilled engineering  sales  marketing and managerial personnel 
if we are unable to attract a sufficient number of qualified personnel  particularly personnel knowledgeable in software engineering and sales and marketing  experienced in the security market  we may not be able to meet key objectives such as developing  upgrading  or enhancing our products in a timely manner  and effectively marketing our products to customers  any of which could negatively impact our business and could hinder any future growth 
we have decided to discontinue selling third party data storage networking products  which could decrease our leverage with certain customers 
the decision to cease selling third party data storage networking products may significantly reduce the amount of business we transact with certain customers  which in turn may reduce our leverage with these customers 
as a result we may have increased difficulty collecting outstanding accounts receivable with some of these customers  which would increase the costs of exiting this portion of the business  or customers may be less inclined to purchase other products from us 
either of these factors could have a negative impact on our business 
additionally  because we have outsourced customer support activities of these third party data storage networking products to a third party  we will continue to depend on this third party to successfully address our customers needs for the remaining outstanding warranty period 
although we may pay the third party in full for this service  if it does not fulfill its obligation we may be required to incur additional costs to satisfy the customer s needs  which may negatively affect our business 
risks related to financial results 
we have a history of losses and may continue to experience losses in the future  which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
since our inception  we have incurred significant net losses and could incur net losses in the future and at september  our accumulated deficit was million 
we believe that any future growth will require us to incur significant engineering  selling and marketing and administrative expenses  including meeting new regulatory and corporate governance requirements 
as a result  we will need to generate significant revenues to achieve and sustain profitability 
if we do not achieve and sustain profitability  the market price for our common stock may decline 
if our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies are based on assumptions that change or prove to be incorrect  our operating results could fall below expectations of securities analysts and investors  resulting in a decline in our stock price 
our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate significant estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements  including those related to revenue recognition  including sales returns and allowances  provision for doubtful accounts  inventory reserves  warranty reserves  analysis of impairment of goodwill and other long lived intangible assets  realization of deferred tax assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  as provided in our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these and other estimates if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions  which could cause our operating results to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors  resulting in a decline in our stock price 
our quarterly revenues and operating results may fluctuate seasonally  which could result in decreased revenue from quarter to quarter  which in turn could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
seasonal fluctuations in revenues and operating results in the data storage networking industry are common 
in particular  this industry typically experiences increased orders and resulting revenues in the quarter ended december  and a subsequent decline in orders and resulting revenues during the quarter ended march with a substantial amount of our revenues currently derived from data storage networking products  we may experience significant quarter to quarter fluctuations in revenues and operating results due to customers timing their orders based on their own quarterly financial and or operational considerations  which we have no influence over 
accordingly  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
nonetheless  the market price of our common stock could decline in response to these variations 
our quarterly revenues and operating results may also fluctuate for reasons other than seasonality  which could cause our operating results to fall below expectations and thus impact the market price of our common stock 
in addition to seasonality issues  our quarterly revenues and operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter 
additionally  none of our customers are obligated to purchase any quantity of our products in the future nor are they obligated to meet forecasts of their product needs 
our operating expense levels are based in part on expectations of future revenues and gross profits  which are partially dependent on our customer s ability to accurately forecast and communicate their future product needs 
if revenues or gross profits in a particular quarter do not meet expectations  operating results could suffer and the market price of our common stock could decline 
factors affecting quarterly operating results include the timing and size of orders from customers  particularly our largest customers  the mix of oem appliance and distribution revenues and the product mix within each  the loss of key suppliers or customers  the availability and or price of products from suppliers  price competition  the timing of expenditures in anticipation of increased revenues  the timing of new product introductions by our oem appliance partners  costs associated with our introduction of our ns series firewall appliances and the market acceptance of those products  the mix of product manufactured internally and by our contract manufacturer  changing global economic or political conditions 
if the products and services that we sell become more commoditized and competition in the server appliance  data storage and network security markets continues to increase  then our gross profit as a percentage of net revenues may decrease and our operating results may suffer 
products and services in the server appliance  data storage networking and network security markets may be subject to further commoditization as these industries continue to mature and other businesses introduce additional competing products and services 
the gross profit as a percentage of revenues of our products may decrease  in response to changes in our product mix  competitive pricing pressures  or new product introductions into the server appliance and data storage markets 
if we are unable to offset decreases in our gross profits as a percentage of revenues by increasing our sales volumes  or by decreasing our product costs  operating results will decline 
changes in the mix of sales of our products  including the mix of higher margin sales of products sold in smaller quantities and lower margin sales of products sold in larger quantities  could adversely affect our operating results for future quarters 
to maintain our gross profits  we also must continue to reduce the manufacturing cost of our server appliance products 
our efforts to produce higher margin server appliance products  continue to improve our server appliance products and produce new server appliance products may make it difficult to reduce our manufacturing cost per product 
further  utilization of a contract manufacturer to produce a portion of our customer requirements for certain of our server appliance products may not allow us to reduce our cost per product 
if we fail to respond adequately to pricing pressures  to competitive products with improved performance or to developments with respect to the other factors on which we compete  we could lose customers or orders 
if we are unable to compete effectively  our business would suffer 
risks related to the server appliance  data storage and network security markets 
if server appliances are not increasingly adopted as a solution to meet a significant portion of companies security and storage networking application needs  the market for server appliances may not grow  which could negatively impact our revenues 
we expect that a substantial portion of our future revenues will come from sales of server appliances 
as a result  we are substantially dependent on the growing use of server appliances to meet businesses storage and security networking application needs 
our revenues may not grow and the market price of our common stock could decline if the server appliance market does not grow as rapidly as we expect 
our expectations for the growth of the server appliance market may not be fulfilled if customers continue to use general purpose servers 
the role of our products could  for example  be limited if general purpose servers out perform server appliances or are offered at a lower cost 
this could force us to lower the prices of our server appliance products or could result in fewer sales of these products  which would negatively impact our revenues and decrease our gross profits 
the products that we sell are subject to rapid technological change and our sales will suffer if these products are rendered obsolete by new technologies 
the markets we serve are characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions and enhancements  potentially short product life cycles  changes in customer demands and evolving industry standards 
in the server appliance market  we attempt to mitigate these risks by utilizing standards based hardware platforms and by maintaining an adequate knowledge base of available technologies 
however  the server appliance products that we sell could be rendered obsolete if products based on new technologies are introduced or new industry standards emerge and we are not able to incorporate these technological changes into our products 

specifically  product development for network security appliances requires considerable engineering time and testing 
releasing new products and services prematurely may result in quality problems  and delays may result in loss of customer confidence and market share 
we may be unable to develop new products and services or achieve and maintain market acceptance of them once they have come to market 
furthermore  when we do introduce new or enhanced products and services  we may be unable to manage the transition from the older products and services to minimize disruption in customer ordering patterns  avoid excessive inventories of older products and deliver enough new products and services to meet customer demand 
to remain competitive in the server appliance market  we must successfully identify new product opportunities and partners and develop and bring new products to market in a timely and cost effective manner 
our failure to keep pace with rapid industry  technological or market changes could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
risks related to competition 
competition in the server appliance market is significant and if we fail to compete effectively  our financial results will suffer 
in the server appliance market  we face significant competition from a number of different types of companies 
our competitors include companies who market general purpose servers  specific purpose servers and server appliances as well as companies that sell custom integration services utilizing hardware produced by other companies 
many of these companies are larger than we are and have greater financial resources and name recognition than we do  as well as significant distribution capabilities and larger  more established service organizations to support their products 
our large competitors may be able to leverage their existing resources  including their extensive distribution capabilities as well as their service organizations  to provide a wider offering of products and services and higher levels of support on a more cost effective basis than we can 
we expect competition in the server appliance market to increase significantly as more companies enter the market and as our existing competitors continue to improve the performance of their current products and to introduce new products and technologies 
such increased competition could adversely affect sales of our current and future products 
in addition  competing companies may be able to undertake more extensive promotional activities  adopt more aggressive pricing policies and offer more attractive terms to their customers than we can 
if our competitors provide lower cost products with greater functionality or support than our server appliance solutions  or if some of their products are comparable to ours and are offered as part of a range of products that is broader than ours  our server appliance solutions could become undesirable 
even if the functionality of competing products is equivalent to ours  we face a risk that a significant number of customers would elect to pay a premium for similar functionality from an established vendor rather than purchase products from a less established vendor 
we attempt to differentiate ourselves from our competition by offering a wide variety of software integration  branding  supply chain management  engineering  support  distribution  logistics and fulfillment services 
if we are unable to effectively differentiate ourselves from our competition  our revenues will not increase and may decline 
furthermore  increased competition could negatively affect our business and future operating results by leading to price reductions  higher selling expenses and a reduction in our market share 
if we are unable to compete successfully in the highly competitive market for network security appliances and services for any reason  such as current or potential competitors gaining competitive advantage through partnering or acquisition  our business could be adversely affected 
the market for firewall security appliances is intensely competitive and we expect competition to intensify in the future 
an increase in competitive pressures in our market or our failure to compete effectively may result in pricing reductions  reduced gross margins and loss of market share 
currently  the primary competitors in our industry relating to firewall security appliances with microsoft isa server include hewlett packard company  celestix networks  inc and pyramid computer gmbh 
competitors in the firewall security industry with appliances using technology other than microsoft isa server include cisco systems  inc  nokia corporation  juniper networks  inc  watchguard technologies  inc and sonicwall  inc substantially all of our competitors have longer operating histories  greater name recognition  larger customer bases and significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than we do 
our current and potential competitors may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties that may further enhance their resources 
in addition  current or potential competitors may be acquired by third parties with greater available resources 
as a result of such potential acquisitions  our current or potential competitors might be able to adapt more quickly to new technologies and customer needs  devote greater resources to the promotion or sale of their products and services  initiate or withstand substantial price competition  take advantage of acquisition or other opportunities more readily or develop and expand their product and service offerings more quickly 
in addition  our competitors may bundle products competitive with ours with other products that they may sell to our current or potential customers 
these customers may accept these bundled products rather than separately purchasing our products 
our revenues could be negatively affected if our larger competitors consolidate their extensive distribution capabilities with our smaller competitors products 
large server manufacturers may not only develop their own server appliance solutions  but they may also acquire or establish cooperative relationships with our smaller competitors  developing server appliance products and related technologies 
because large server manufacturers have significant financial and organizational resources available  they may be able to quickly penetrate the server appliance market by leveraging the technology and expertise of smaller companies with their own extensive distribution channels 
we expect that the server industry will experience further consolidation 
it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share through consolidation 
consolidation within the server marketplace could adversely affect our revenues 
risks related to marketing and sales efforts 
we need to effectively manage our sales and marketing operations to increase market awareness and sales of our products and to promote our brand recognition 
if we fail to do so  our growth will be limited 
although we currently have a relatively small sales and marketing organization  we must continue to increase market awareness and sales of our products and promote our brand in the marketplace 
in the rapidly evolving market for server appliance solutions  we believe that to compete successfully we will need network equipment providers and isvs to recognize network engines as a top tier provider of server appliance platforms  custom integration services and server appliance distribution services 
we must also effectively market to vars and systems integrators our ns series firewall appliances 
this marketing effort requires a significant level of technical knowledge about the software applications included in these server appliance products  a substantial level of understanding about the targeted market into which these products are sold and may require the expenditure of a material amount of managerial and financial resources 
we have limited experience marketing and selling firewall appliance products through our distribution channels and therefore  may not be successful in these efforts 
if we are unable to design and implement marketing campaigns that are effective in promoting our server appliances  or if we fail to promote and maintain the network engines brands  we may not increase or maintain sales and our business may be adversely affected 
our business would also suffer if we incur excessive expenses in these marketing campaigns but fail to achieve the expected or desired increase in revenues 
if we are unable to effectively manage our customer service and support activities  we may not be able to retain our existing customers or attract new customers 
we need to effectively manage our customer support operations to ensure that we maintain good relationships with our customers 
because our ns series firewall appliances provide critical firewall protection for certain applications  managing software updates to the appliance  when and if they are available  will be essential to the performance of the appliance 
managing any such updates released by microsoft will require careful consideration to determine the sensitivity and impact on the function of our appliance 
additionally  any updates designated as vital to the function of our appliance will require rapid deployment to ensure the customers applications are properly protected 
we expect that providing this increased customer service for our ns series firewall appliances will require more technically qualified staff either within the company or from third parties and if we are unable to provide this higher level of service we may be unable to successfully sell such firewall appliances 
if our customer support organization is unsuccessful in maintaining good customer relationships  we may lose customers to our competitors and our reputation in the market could be damaged 
as a result  we may lose revenues and our business could suffer 
furthermore  the costs of this service could be higher than we expect  which could adversely affect our operating results 
a breach of security could harm public perception of our products and services 
we will not succeed unless the marketplace is confident that we provide effective firewall application protection 
even applications protected by our appliances using microsoft s isa server software may be vulnerable to electronic break ins and computer viruses 
if an actual or perceived breach of security occurs in an end user s systems  regardless of whether the breach is attributable to us  the market perception of the efficacy of our products and services could be harmed 
this could cause us or our reseller partners to lose current and potential customers  or cause us to lose potential resellers 
because the techniques used by computer hackers to access or sabotage networks change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target  we may be unable to anticipate these techniques 
risks related to product manufacturing 
our dependence on sole source and limited source suppliers for key server appliance components makes us susceptible to supply shortages and potential quality issues that could prevent us from shipping customer orders on time  if at all  and could result in lost sales and customers 
we depend upon single source and limited source suppliers for our industry standard processors  main logic boards  certain disk drives  hardware platforms and power supplies as well as certain of our cooling systems  chassis and sheet metal parts 
we also depend on limited sources to supply certain other industry standard and customized components 
we have in the past experienced  and may in the future experience  shortages of or difficulties in acquiring components in the quantities and of the quality needed to produce our server appliance products 
shortages in supply or quality issues related to these key components for an extended time would cause delays in the production of our server appliance products  prevent us from satisfying our contractual obligations and meeting customer expectations  and result in lost sales and customers 
if we are unable to buy components in the quantities and of the quality that we need on a timely basis or at acceptable prices  we will not be able to manufacture and deliver our server appliance products on a timely or cost effective basis to our customers  and our competitive position  reputation  business  financial condition and results of operations could be seriously harmed 
if our server appliance products fail to perform properly and conform to specifications  our customers may demand refunds  assert claims for damages or terminate existing relationships with us and our reputation and operating results may suffer materially 
because server appliance hardware platforms are complex  they could contain errors that can be detected at any point in a product s life cycle 
if flaws in design  production  assembly or testing of our products by us or our suppliers were to occur  we could experience a rate of failure in our products that could result in substantial repair  replacement or service costs and potential damage to our reputation 
in addition  because our solutions are combined with products from other vendors  should problems occur  it might be difficult to identify the source of the problem 
continued improvement in manufacturing capabilities  control of material and manufacturing quality and costs  and product testing are critical factors in our future growth 
there can be no assurance that our efforts to monitor  develop  modify and implement appropriate test and manufacturing processes for our products will be sufficient to permit us to avoid a rate of failure in our products that results in substantial delays in shipment  significant repair or replacement costs or potential damage to our reputation  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
in the past  we have discovered errors in some of our server appliance solutions and have experienced delays in the shipment of our server appliance products during the period required to correct these errors or we have had to replace defective products that were already shipped 
errors in our server appliance solutions may be found in the future and any of these errors could be significant 
significant errors  including those discussed above  may result in the loss of or delay in market acceptance and sales of our server appliance products  diversion of engineering resources  increased manufacturing costs  the loss of new or existing server appliance partners  injury to our reputation and other customer relations problems  and increased maintenance and warranty costs 
any of these problems could harm our business and future operating results 
product errors or delays could be material  including any product errors or delays associated with the introduction of new products or versions of existing products 
if our server appliance solutions fail to conform to warranted specifications  customers could demand a refund for the purchase price and assert claims for damages 
moreover  because our server appliance solutions may be used in connection with critical computing systems services  we may receive significant liability claims if they do not work properly 
while our agreements with customers typically contain provisions intended to limit our exposure to liability claims  these limitations do not preclude all potential claims 
liability claims could exceed our insurance coverage and require us to spend significant time and money in litigation or to pay significant damages 
any claims for damages  even if unsuccessful  could seriously damage our reputation and business 
our future server appliance revenue growth is dependent on our ability to expand production capacity 
our existing manufacturing facility is limited in its production capacity 
for us to achieve significant server appliance revenue growth our server appliance sales volumes must increase significantly and our production capacity must increase to support such sales volumes 
to supplement our current production capacity  to provide for increased capacity for production spikes and to provide disaster backup capabilities  we currently utilize the services of a contract manufacturer for certain server appliance products 
however  our contract manufacturer is not obligated to supply products to us for any specific period  or in any specific quantity  except as may be provided in a particular purchase order 
using a contract manufacturer increases our cost of producing server appliance products and could decrease our gross profits 
in the event that we need to change contract manufacturers or require significantly increased production levels  we could experience transitional difficulties  including production delays and quality control issues  that could prevent us from satisfying our production requirements on a timely basis  cause customer relationships to suffer and result in lost sales 
also  the use of a contract manufacturer does not guarantee us production levels  manufacturing line space or manufacturing prices  the lack of which could interrupt our business operations and have a negative effect on operating results 
we have recently expanded our internal production capacity through expansion of our current production facilities 
although we believe that our current facility  along with our use of a contract manufacturer to supplement production  is sufficient to support our business for the foreseeable future  we may need additional production capacity 
although we believe that we could expand production levels in our existing facility  we are currently utilizing all available manufacturing space in our existing facility and we may have difficulties expanding this facility any further 
therefore  significant further expansion of the production capacity either in our existing facilities or by expanding into additional facilities could require substantial investments  which could detract from our ability to invest in other areas of our business and may not result in the desired return on investment  which could negatively affect our operating results 
if we do not accurately forecast our server appliance materials requirements  our business and operating results could be adversely affected 
we use rolling forecasts based on anticipated product orders to determine our server appliance component requirements 
lead times for materials and components that we order vary significantly  depending among other things  on specific supplier requirements  contract terms and current market demand for those components 
in addition  a variety of factors  including the timing of product releases  potential delays or cancellations of orders and the timing of large orders  make it difficult to predict product orders 
as a result  our materials requirement forecasts may not be accurate 
if we overestimate our materials requirements  we may have excess inventory  which would increase costs and negatively impact our cash position 
our agreements with certain customers provide us with protections related to inventory purchased in accordance with the terms of these agreements  however  these protections may not be sufficient to prevent certain losses as a result of excess or obsolete inventory 
if we underestimate our materials requirements  we may have inadequate inventory  which could interrupt our manufacturing and delay delivery of our server appliance products to customers resulting in a loss of sales or customers 
any of these occurrences would negatively impact our business and operating results 
risks related to product dependence on intellectual property 
our reliance upon contractual provisions  domestic patent  copyright and trademark laws and applied for patents to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient to protect our intellectual property 
certain of our server appliance solutions are differentiated from the products of our competitors by our internally developed software and hardware and the manner in which they are integrated into our server appliance solutions 
if we fail to protect our intellectual property  other vendors could sell products with features similar to ours  which could reduce demand for our solutions 
we have taken what we believe to be the necessary and appropriate steps to safeguard our intellectual property 
however  these steps may afford us only limited protection 
others may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology or design around the patents we own 
despite the precautions we have taken  laws and contractual restrictions may not be sufficient to prevent misappropriation of our technology or deter others from developing similar technologies 
in addition  there can be no guarantee that any of our patent applications will result in patents  or that any such patents would provide effective protection of our technology 
in addition  the laws of the countries in which we may decide to market our services and solutions may offer little or no effective protection of our proprietary technology 
reverse engineering  unauthorized copying or other misappropriation of our proprietary technology could enable third parties to benefit from our technology without paying us for it  which would significantly harm our business 
in addition  our us patents have no effect in foreign jurisdictions and obtaining patent protection in foreign countries is expensive and time consuming 
our operating results would suffer if we  or our isv or network equipment provider partners  were subject to an infringement claim that resulted in protracted litigation  the award of significant damages against us or the payment of substantial ongoing royalties 
substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in the technology industry 
we expect that server appliance products may be subject to third party infringement claims as the number of competitors in the industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlap 
from time to time we receive claims from third parties that our server appliance products have infringed their intellectual property rights 
we do not believe that our server appliance products employ technology that infringes the proprietary rights of any third parties 
we are also not aware of any claims made against any of our isv or network equipment provider partners related to their infringement of the proprietary rights other parties in relation to products that include our server appliance products 
other parties may make claims against us that  with or without merit  could be time consuming for us to address  require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements  result in costly litigation  including potential liability for damages  divert our management s attention and resources  and cause product shipment delays 
in addition  other parties may make claims against our isv or network equipment provider partners related to products that are incorporated into our server appliance products 
our business could be adversely affected if such claims resulted in the inability of our isv or network equipment provider partners to continue to produce the infringing product or if these claims prohibited us from licensing the software applications of our isv partners 
other risks related to our business 
class action lawsuits have been filed against us  our board of directors  our chairman and certain of our executive officers and other lawsuits may be instituted against us from time to time 
in december  a class action lawsuit relating to our initial public offering was filed against us  our chairman  one of our executive officers and the underwriters of our initial public offering 
in addition  in january  a purported class action lawsuit was filed against us and our board of directors relating to the acquisition of tidalwire inc more recently  commencing on december   a number of purported class action lawsuits were filed against us and john h 
curtis  our president and ceo  douglas g 
bryant  our cfo  vice president of finance and administration  treasurer and secretary  and lawrence genovesi  our chairman of the board relating to the timing of our announcement of the amendment of our hba distribution agreement with emc 
for more information on these lawsuits  see part i  item legal proceedings 
in december  we settled the class action lawsuit filed against us relating to the acquisition of tidalwire inc and we are currently attempting to settle the lawsuit filed against us related to our initial public offering 
we are unable to predict the effects on our financial condition  or our business  of the lawsuit related to our initial public offering  the lawsuit related to our announcement of the amendment of our hba distribution agreement with emc or other lawsuits that may arise from time to time 
while we maintain certain insurance coverage  there can be no assurance that claims against us will not result in substantial monetary damages in excess of such insurance coverage 
these class action lawsuits  or any future lawsuits  could cause our director and officer insurance premiums to increase and could affect our ability to obtain director and officer insurance coverage  which would negatively affect our business 
in addition  we have expended  and may in the future expend  significant resources to defend such claims 
these class action lawsuits  or other similar lawsuits that may arise from time to time  could negatively impact both our financial condition and the market price of our common stock and could result in management devoting a substantial portion of their time to these lawsuits  which could adversely affect the operation of our business 
if the site of our manufacturing operations were to experience a significant disruption in its operations  it would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of our operations 
our manufacturing facility and headquarters are concentrated in one location 
if the operations in this facility were disrupted as a result of a natural disaster  fire  power or other utility outage  work stoppage or other similar event  our business could be seriously harmed as a result of interruptions or delays in our manufacturing  distribution or post sales support operations 
if we do not retain our senior management  we may not be able to successfully execute our business strategy 
the loss of key members of our management team could harm us 
our success is substantially dependent on the ability  experience and performance of our senior management team 
because of their ability and experience  we may not be able to successfully execute our business strategy if we were to lose one or more of these individuals 
if we are unable to successfully execute our business strategy  our operating results would suffer 
the market price for our common stock may be particularly volatile  and our stockholders may be unable to resell their shares at a profit 
the market price of our common stock has been subject to significant fluctuations and may continue to fluctuate or decline 
during fiscal  the price of our common stock ranged from a low of to a high of and during fiscal from a low of to a high of 
the stock markets have experienced significant price and trading volume fluctuations 
the market for technology stocks has been extremely volatile and frequently reaches levels that bear no relationship to the past or present operating performance of those companies 
general economic conditions  such as recession or interest rate or currency rate fluctuations in the united states or abroad  could negatively affect the market price of our common stock 
in addition  our operating results may be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors 
if this were to occur  the market price of our common stock may decrease significantly 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against such companies 
such litigation could result in substantial cost and a diversion of management s attention and resources 
the market price of our common stock may fluctuate in response to various factors  some of which are beyond our control 
these factors include  but are not limited to  the following changes in our relationship or contracts with emc  market acceptance of our ns series firewall appliance  actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results  changes in financial estimates or investment recommendations by securities analysts who follow our business  technological advances or introduction of new products by us or our competitors  the loss of key personnel  our sale of common stock or other securities in the future  significant sales of our common stock by existing stockholders  affiliates and insiders  intellectual property or litigation developments  changes in market valuations or earnings of our competitors or other technology companies  changes in business or regulatory conditions  the trading volume of our common stock  and disruptions in the geopolitical environment  including war in the middle east or elsewhere or acts of terrorism in the united states or elsewhere 
any decline in the market price of our common stock or negative market conditions could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital  to complete future acquisitions of or investments in other businesses and to attract and retain qualified technical and sales and marketing personnel 
we have anti takeover defenses that could delay or prevent an acquisition and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and  without any further vote or action on the part of the stockholders  will have the authority to determine the price  rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions of the preferred stock 
this preferred stock  if issued  might have preference over the rights of the holders of common stock and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
the issuance of this preferred stock may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us or to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
we currently have no plans to issue preferred stock 
in addition  provisions of our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation  second amended and restated by laws may deter an unsolicited offer to purchase us 
these provisions  coupled with the provisions of the delaware general corporation law  may delay or impede a merger  tender offer or proxy contest involving us 
for example  our board of directors is divided into three classes  only one of which is elected at each annual meeting 
these factors may further delay or prevent a change of control of our business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not engage in any foreign currency hedging transactions and therefore  do not believe we are subject to exchange rate risk 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
we invest excess cash balances in cash equivalents and short term investments 
we believe that the effect  if any  of reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows will not be material
