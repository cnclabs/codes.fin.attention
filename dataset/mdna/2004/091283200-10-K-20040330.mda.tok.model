overview the company was formed in may  and as of december  managed offices in colorado  new mexico  and arizona staffed by dentists and specialists 
the company has acquired practices five of which were consolidated into existing offices and opened de novo offices one of which was consolidated into an existing office 
of the acquired practices  only three the first three practices  which were acquired from the company s president  mark birner  dds were acquired from affiliates of the company 
the company derives all of its revenue as defined below from its management agreements with the pcs in addition  the company assumes a number of responsibilities when it acquires a new practice or develops a de novo office  which are set forth in the management agreement  as described below 
the company expects to expand in existing markets primarily by enhancing the operating performance of its existing offices  by acquiring dental practices and by developing de novo offices 
the company has historically expanded in existing markets by acquiring solo and group dental practices and may do so in the future if an economically feasible opportunity presents itself 
generally  the company seeks to acquire dental practices for which the company believes application of its dental practice management model will improve operating performance 
see items and business and properties operations dental practice management model 
the company was formed with the intention of becoming the leading provider of business services to dental practices in colorado 
the company s growth and success in the colorado market led to its expansion into new mexico and arizona markets 
the company s growth strategy is to focus on greater utilization of existing physical capacity through recruiting more dentists and support staff and through selective acquisitions and development of de novo offices in the company embarked on a strategy to increase revenues 
some of the initiatives begun were the signing of a lease for a de novo site in the phoenix area  negotiating other leases for de novo sites  evaluating potential acquisitions  expanding the specialty services side of the business  aggressively recruiting additional dentists and an expanded marketing plan 
the company has grown primarily through the ongoing development of a dense dental practice network and the implementation of its dental practice management model 
during the three years ended december   net revenue was million in  million in  and million in during the three years ended december   contribution from dental offices increased from million in to million for  and increased to million for during the three years ended december   operating income increased from  for to million in and to million in at december   the company s total assets of million included million of identifiable intangible assets related to management agreements 
at that date  the company s total shareholders equity was million 
the company reviews the recorded amount of intangible assets and other long lived assets for impairment for each office whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
if this review indicates that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable as determined based on the undiscounted cash flows of each office  whether acquired or developed  the carrying value of the asset is reduced to fair value 
among the factors that the company will continually evaluate are unfavorable changes in each office  relative market share and local market competitive environment  current period and forecasted operating results  cash flow levels of offices and the impact on the net revenue earned by the company  and the legal and regulatory factors governing the practice of dentistry 
as of december  a review by the company determined that there was no permanent impairment of any long lived or intangible asset at any office 
components of revenue and expenses total dental group practice revenue revenue represents the revenue of the offices  reported at estimated realizable amounts  received from third party payors and patients for dental services rendered at the offices 
net revenue represents revenue less amounts retained by the offices 
the amounts retained by the offices represent amounts paid as salary  benefits and other payments to employed dentists and hygienists 
the company s net revenue is dependent on the revenue of the offices 
management service fee revenue represents the net revenue earned by the company for the offices for which the company has management agreements  but does not have control 
direct expenses consist of the expenses incurred by the company in connection with managing the offices  including salaries and benefits for personnel other than dentists and hygienists  dental supplies  dental laboratory fees  occupancy costs  advertising and marketing  depreciation and amortization and general and administrative including office supplies  equipment leases  management information systems and other expenses related to dental practice operations 
the company also incurs personnel and administrative expenses in connection with maintaining a corporate function that provides management  administrative  marketing  development and professional services to the offices 
under each of the management agreements  the company manages the business and marketing aspects of the offices  including i providing capital  ii designing and implementing marketing programs  iii negotiating for the purchase of supplies  iv staffing  v recruiting  vi training of non dental personnel  vii billing and collecting patient fees  viii arranging for certain legal and accounting services  and ix negotiating with managed care organizations 
the pc is responsible for  among other things  i supervision of all dentists and dental hygienists  ii complying with all laws  rules and regulations relating to dentists and dental hygienists  and iii maintaining proper patient records 
the company has made  and intends to make in the future  loans to pcs in colorado  new mexico and arizona to fund their acquisition of dental assets from third parties in order to comply with the laws of such states 
under the typical management agreement used by the company  the pc pays the company a management fee equal to the adjusted gross center revenue of the pc less compensation paid to the dentists and dental hygienists employed at the office of the pc adjusted gross center revenue is comprised of all fees and charges booked each month by or on behalf of the pc as a result of dental services provided to patients at the office  less any adjustments for uncollectible accounts  professional courtesies and other activities that do not generate a collectible fee 
the company s costs include all direct and indirect costs  overhead and expenses relating to the company s provision of management services at the office under the management agreement  including i salaries  benefits and other direct costs of company employees who work at the office  ii direct costs of all company employees or consultants who provide services to or in connection with the office  iii utilities  janitorial  laboratory  supplies  advertising and other expenses incurred by the company in carrying out its obligations under the management agreement  iv depreciation expense associated with the pc s assets and the assets of the company used at the office  and the amortization of intangible asset value relating to the office  v interest expense on indebtedness incurred by the company to finance any of its obligations under the management agreement  vi general and malpractice insurance expenses  lease expenses and dentist recruitment expenses  vii personal property and other taxes assessed against the company s or the pc s assets used in connection with the operation of the office  viii out of pocket expenses of the company s personnel related to mergers or acquisitions involving the pc  ix corporate overhead charges or any other expenses of the company including the pc s pro rata share of the expenses of the accounting and computer services provided by the company  and x a collection reserve in the amount of of adjusted gross center revenue 
as a result  substantially all costs associated with the provision of dental services at the office are borne by the company  other than the compensation and benefits of the dentists and hygienists who work at the offices of the pcs this enables the company to manage the profitability of the offices 
each management agreement is for a term of years 
further  each management agreement generally may be terminated by the pc only for cause  which includes a material default by or bankruptcy of the company 
upon expiration or termination of a management agreement by either party  the pc must satisfy all obligations it has to the company 
the company s revenue is derived principally from fee for service revenue and revenue from capitated managed dental care plans 
fee for service revenue consists of pc revenue received from indemnity dental plans  preferred provider plans and direct payments by patients not covered by any third party payment arrangement 
managed dental care revenue consists of pc revenue received from capitated managed dental care plans  including capitation payments and patient co payments 
capitated managed dental care contracts are between dental benefits organizations and the pcs under the management agreements  the company negotiates and administers these contracts on behalf of the pcs under a capitated managed dental care contract  the dental group practice provides dental services to the members of the dental benefits organization and receives a fixed monthly capitation payment for each plan member covered for a specific schedule of services regardless of the quantity or cost of services to the participating dental group practice obligated to provide them 
this arrangement shifts the risk of utilization of these services to the dental group practice providing the dental services 
because the company assumes responsibility under the management agreements for all aspects of the operation of the dental practices other than the practice of dentistry and thus bears all costs of the pcs associated with the provision of dental services at the office other than compensation and benefits of dentists and hygienists  the risk of over utilization of dental services at the office under capitated managed dental care plans is effectively shifted to the company 
in addition  dental group practices participating in a capitated managed dental care plan often receive supplemental payments for more complicated or elective procedures 
in contrast  under traditional indemnity insurance arrangements  the insurance company pays whatever reasonable charges are billed by the dental group practice for the dental services provided 
see items and business and properties payor mix 
the company seeks to increase its fee for service business by increasing the patient volume of existing offices through effective marketing and advertising programs and by opening new offices 
the company seeks to supplement this fee for service business with revenue from contracts with capitated managed dental care plans 
although the company s fee for service business generally provides a greater margin than its capitated managed dental care business  capitated managed dental care business serves to increase facility utilization and dentist productivity 
the relative percentage of the company s revenue derived from fee for service business and capitated managed dental care contracts varies from market to market depending on the availability of capitated managed dental care contracts in any particular market and the company s ability to negotiate favorable contractual terms 
in addition  the profitability of managed dental care revenue varies from market to market depending on the level of capitation payments and co payments in proportion to the level of benefits required to be provided 
results of operations in the company embarked on a strategy to increase revenues 
some of the initiatives begun were the signing of a lease for a de novo site in the phoenix area  negotiating other leases for de novo sites  evaluating potential acquisitions  expanding the specialty services side of the business  aggressively recruiting additional dentists and an expanded marketing plan 
as these initiatives are continuing  the company believes that the period to period comparisons set forth below may not be representative of future operating results 
for the year ended december   revenue increased to million compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of  or 
this was attributable to higher revenues generated in the offices in existence during both full periods 
for the year ended december   revenue increased to million compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million or 
this was attributable to higher revenues generated in the offices in existence during both full periods 
the company has successfully reduced the percentage of its business which comes from capitated managed dental care plans from of revenue in to of revenue in  and replaced that capitated revenue stream with higher margin fee for service business 
this higher margin fee for service revenue has predominately been business derived from preferred provider plans

a summary of those significant accounting policies can be found in the company s notes to consolidated financial statements 
the estimates used by management are based upon the company s historical experiences combined with management s understanding of current facts and circumstances 
certain of the company s accounting policies are considered critical as they are both important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and the results of its operations and require significant or complex judgments on the part of management 
management has not determined how reported amounts would differ based on the application of different accounting policies 
management has also not determined the likelihood that materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
management believes that the following represent the critical accounting policies of the company as described in financial reporting release no 
 cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies  which was issued by the securities and exchange commission impairment of intangible and long lived assets  allowance for doubtful accounts and deferred income taxes 
the company s dental practice acquisitions involve the purchase of tangible and intangible assets and the assumption of certain liabilities of the acquired offices 
as part of the purchase price allocation  the company allocates the purchase price to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed  based on estimated fair market values 
costs of acquisition in excess of the net estimated fair value of tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed are allocated to the management agreement 
the management agreement represents the company s right to manage the offices during the year term of the agreement 
the assigned value of the management agreement is amortized using the straight line method over a period of years 
in the event that facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of long lived and intangible assets may be impaired  an evaluation of recoverability would be performed 
if this evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable as determined based on the undiscounted cash flows of each office  whether acquired or developed  the carrying value of the asset is reduced to fair value 
among the factors that the company will continually evaluate are unfavorable changes in each office  relative market share and local market competitive environment  current period and forecasted operating results  cash flow levels of offices and the impact on the net revenue earned by the company  and the legal and regulatory factors governing the practice of dentistry 
the company s allowance for doubtful accounts reflects a reserve that reduces customer accounts receivable to the net amount estimated to be collectible 
estimating the credit worthiness of customers and the recoverability of customer accounts requires management to exercise considerable judgment 
in estimating uncollectible amounts  management considers factors such as general economic and industry specific conditions  historical customer performance and anticipated customer performance 
while management considers the company s processes to be adequate to effectively quantify its exposure to doubtful accounts  changes in economic  industry or specific customer conditions may require the company to adjust its allowance for doubtful accounts 
deferred income taxes are recognized for the expected tax consequences in future years for differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts  based upon enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
the company s significant deferred tax assets are related to accruals not currently deductible  allowance for doubtful accounts  amt tax credit carry forward and depreciation expense for tax which is less than depreciation expense for books 
the company has not established a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets as the company expects to fully recover these amounts in future periods 
the company s significant deferred tax liability is the result of intangible asset amortization expense for tax being greater than the intangible asset amortization expense for books 
management reviews and adjusts those estimates annually based upon the most current information available 
however  because the recoverability of deferred taxes are directly dependent upon the future operating results of the company  actual recoverability of deferred taxes may differ materially from management s estimates

on august  the company s current credit facility agreement was amended 
the new credit facility allows the company to borrow  on a revolving basis  an aggregate principal amount not to exceed million at either  or a combination of  the lender s base rate plus a base rate margin or at a libor rate plus a libor rate margin  at the company s option 
the lender s base rate computes interest at the higher of the lender s prime rate plus a base rate margin of one half percent or the federal funds rate plus one half percent  plus a base rate margin of one half percent 
the libor option computes interest at the libor rate as of the date such libor rate loan was made plus a libor rate margin of

in order to meet its long term liquidity needs the company may need to issue additional equity and debt securities  subject to market and other conditions 
there can be no assurance that such additional financing will be available on terms acceptable to the company 
the failure to raise the funds necessary to finance its future cash requirements could adversely affect the company s ability to pursue its strategy and could negatively affect its operations in future periods

demands on management 
the company s ability to compete effectively will depend upon its ability to hire  train and assimilate additional management and other employees  and its ability to expand  improve and effectively utilize its operating  management  marketing and financial systems to accommodate its expanded operations 
any failure by the company s management to effectively anticipate  implement and manage the changes required to sustain the company s growth may have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
see items and business and properties expansion program 
dependence upon availability of dentists and other personnel 
the company believes that the profitability and operations of its offices and its expansion strategy are dependent on the availability and successful recruitment and retention of dentists  dental assistants  hygienists  specialists and other personnel 
the company may not be able to recruit or retain dentists and other personnel for its existing and newly established offices  which may have a material adverse effect on the company s expansion strategy and its business  financial condition and operating results 
see items and business and properties operations dental practice model 
dependence on management agreements  the pcs and affiliated dentists 
the company receives management fees for services provided to the pcs under management agreements 
the company owns most of the non dental operating assets of the offices but does not employ or contract with dentists  employ hygienists or control the provision of dental care 
the company s revenue is dependent on the revenue generated by the pcs therefore  effective and continued performance of dentists providing services for the pcs is essential to the company s long term success 
under each management agreement  the company pays substantially all of the operating and non operating expenses associated with the provision of dental services except for the salaries and benefits of the dentists and hygienists and principal and interest payments of loans made to the pc by the company 
any material loss of revenue by the pcs would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results  and any termination of a management agreement which is permitted in the event of a material default or bankruptcy by either party could have such an effect 
in the event of a breach of a management agreement by a pc  there can be no assurance that the legal remedies available to the company will be adequate to compensate the company for its damages resulting from such breach

risks associated with de novo office development 
the company utilizes internal and external resources to identify locations in suitable markets for the development of de novo offices 
identifying locations in suitable geographic markets and negotiating leases can be a lengthy and costly process 
furthermore  the company will need to provide each new office with the appropriate equipment  furnishings  materials and supplies 
to date  the company s average cost to open a de novo office has been approximately  future de novo office development may require a greater investment by the company 
additionally  new offices must be staffed with one or more dentists 
because a new office may be staffed with a dentist with no previous patient base  significant advertising and marketing expenditures may be required to attract patients 
there can be no assurance that a de novo office will become profitable for the company

need for additional capital  uncertainty of additional financing 
implementation of the company s growth strategy has required significant capital resources 
such resources will be needed to establish additional offices  maintain or upgrade the company s management information systems  and for the effective integration  operation and expansion of the offices 
the company historically has used principally cash and promissory notes as consideration in acquisitions of dental practices and intends to continue to do so 
if the company s capital requirements over the next several years exceed cash flow generated from operations and borrowings available under the company s existing credit facility or any successor credit facility  the company may need to issue additional equity securities and incur additional debt 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities  dilution to the company s existing shareholders may result 
additional debt or non common stock equity financings could be required to the extent that the common stock fails to maintain a market value sufficient to warrant its use for future financing needs 
if additional funds are raised through the incurrence of debt  such debt instruments will likely contain restrictive financial  maintenance and security covenants 
the company may not be able to obtain additional required capital on satisfactory terms  if at all 
the failure to raise the funds necessary to finance the expansion of the company s operations or the company s other capital requirements could have a material and adverse effect on the company s ability to pursue its strategy and on its business  financial condition and operating results 
see liquidity and capital resources in this item conduct of practice 
the practice of dentistry is regulated at both the state and federal levels 
there can be no assurance that the regulatory environment in which the company or pcs operate will not change significantly in the future 
in addition  state and federal laws regulate health maintenance organizations and other managed care organizations for which dentists may be providers 
in general  regulation of health care companies is increasing 
in connection with its operations in existing markets and expansion into new markets  the company may become subject to additional laws  regulations and interpretations or enforcement actions 
the laws regulating health care are broad and subject to varying interpretations  and there is currently a lack of case law construing such statutes and regulations 
the ability of the company to operate profitably will depend in part upon the ability of the company to operate in compliance with applicable health care regulations 
the laws of many states  including colorado and new mexico  permit a dentist to conduct a dental practice only as an individual  a member of a partnership or an employee of a professional corporation  limited liability company or limited liability partnership 
these laws typically prohibit  either by specific provision or as a matter of general policy  non dental entities  such as the company  from practicing dentistry  from employing dentists and  in certain circumstances  hygienists or dental assistants  or from otherwise exercising control over the provision of dental services 
many states  including colorado  limit the ability of a person other than a licensed dentist to own or control dental equipment or offices used in a dental practice 
in addition  arizona  colorado  new mexico  and many other states impose limits on the tasks that may be delegated by dentists to hygienists and dental assistants 
some states  including arizona  colorado and new mexico  regulate the content of advertisements of dental services 
some states require entities designated as clinics to be licensed  and may define clinics to include dental practices that are owned or controlled in whole or in part by non dentists 
these laws and their interpretations vary from state to state and are enforced by the courts and by regulatory authorities with broad discretion 
many states  including colorado and new mexico  also prohibit fee splitting by dentists with any party except other dentists in the same professional corporation or practice entity 
in most cases  these laws have been construed as applying to the practice of paying a portion of a fee to another person for referring a patient or otherwise generating business  and not to prohibit payment of reasonable compensation for facilities and services other than the generation of referrals  even if the payment is based on a percentage of the practice s revenues 
managed care contracts many states have fraud and abuse laws  which apply to referrals for items or services reimbursable by any third party payor  not just by medicare and medicaid 
a number of states  including arizona  colorado and new mexico  prohibit the submitting of false claims for dental services 
in addition  there are certain regulatory risks associated with the company s role in negotiating and administering managed care contracts 
the application of state insurance laws to third party payor arrangements  other than fee for service arrangements  is an unsettled area of law with little guidance available 
specifically  in some states  regulators may determine that the pcs are engaged in the business of insurance  particularly if they contract on a financial risk basis directly with self insured employers or other entities that are not licensed to engage in the business of insurance 
if the pcs are determined to be engaged in the business of insurance  the company may be required to change the method of payment from third party payors and the company s business  financial condition and operating results may be materially and adversely affected 
federal laws generally regulate reimbursement and billing practices under medicare and medicaid programs 
the federal fraud and abuse statute prohibits  among other things  the payment  offer  solicitation or receipt of any form of remuneration  directly or indirectly  in cash or in kind to induce or in exchange for i the referral of a person for services reimbursable by medicare or medicaid  or ii the purchasing  leasing  ordering or arranging for or recommending the purchase  lease or order of any item  good  facility or service which is reimbursable under medicare or medicaid 
because the pcs receive no revenue under medicare and medicaid  the impact of these laws on the company to date has been negligible 
there can be no assurance  however  that the pcs will not have patients in the future covered by these laws  or that the scope of these laws will not be expanded in the future  and if expanded  such laws or interpretations thereunder could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
on april   health care providers  including the company  were required to comply with the electronic data security and privacy requirements of the health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa 
hipaa delegates enforcement authority to the centers for medicare services office for civil rights 
noncompliance with hipaa regulations can result in severe penalties up to  in fines and up to ten years in prison 
as of december   the company was in full compliance with all requirements of hippa and there has been no material impact on the company due to the implementation of these new regulations 
although the company believes that its operations as currently conducted are in material compliance with applicable laws  there can be no assurance that the company s contractual arrangements will not be successfully challenged as violating applicable fraud and abuse  self referral  false claims  fee splitting  insurance  facility licensure or certificate of need laws or that the enforceability of such arrangements will not be limited as a result of such laws 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the business structure under which the company operates  or the advertising strategy the company employs  will not be deemed to constitute the unlicensed practice of dentistry or the operation of an unlicensed clinic or health care facility 
the company has not sought judicial or regulatory interpretations with respect to the manner in which it conducts its business 
there can be no assurance that a review of the business of the company and the pcs by courts or regulatory authorities will not result in a determination that could materially and adversely affect their operations or that the regulatory environment will not change so as to restrict the company s existing or future operations 
in the event that any legislative measures  regulatory provisions or rulings or judicial decisions restrict or prohibit the company from carrying on its business or from expanding its operations to certain jurisdictions  structural and organizational modifications of the company s organization and arrangements may be required  which could have a material adverse effect on the company  or the company may be required to cease operations or change the way it conducts business 
see items and business and properties government regulation 
risks associated with acquisitions 
the company has grown substantially in a relatively short period of time  in large part through acquisitions of existing offices and through the development of de novo offices 
since its organization in may  the company has completed dental practice acquisitions  five of which have been consolidated into existing offices 
in the company embarked on a strategy to increase revenues 
some of the initiatives begun were the signing of a lease for a de novo site in the phoenix area  negotiating other leases for de novo sites  evaluating potential acquisitions  expanding the specialty services side of the business  aggressively recruiting additional dentists and an expanded marketing plan 
the success of future acquisitions will depend on factors  which include the following o ability to identify suitable dental practices 
identifying appropriate acquisition candidates and negotiating and consummating acquisitions can be a lengthy and costly process 
furthermore  the company may compete for acquisition opportunities with companies that have greater resources than the company 
there can be no assurance that suitable acquisition candidates will be identified or that acquisitions will be consummated on terms favorable to the company  on a timely basis or at all 
if a planned acquisition fails to occur or is delayed  the company s quarterly financial results may be materially lower than analysts expectations  which likely would cause a decline  perhaps substantial  in the market price of the common stock 
in addition  increasing consolidation in the dental management services industry may result in an increase in purchase prices required to be paid by the company to acquire dental practices 
integration of dental practices 
the integration of acquired dental practices into the company s networks is a difficult  costly and time consuming process which  among other things  requires the company to attract and retain competent and experienced management and administrative personnel and to implement and integrate reporting and tracking systems  management information systems and other operating systems 
in addition  such integration may require the expansion of accounting controls and procedures and the evaluation of certain personnel functions 
there can be no assurance that substantial unanticipated problems  costs or delays associated with such integration efforts or with such acquired practices will not occur 
there also can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully integrate acquired practices in a timely manner or at all  or that any acquired practices will have a positive impact on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
reliance on certain personnel 
the success of the company  depends on the continued services of a relatively limited number of members of the company s senior management  including its chief executive officer  fred birner  its president  mark birner  dds  and its chief financial officer  treasurer and secretary  dennis genty 
the company believes its future success will depend in part upon its ability to attract and retain qualified management personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense and the company competes for qualified personnel with numerous other employers  some of which have greater financial and other resources than the company 
the loss of the services of one or more members of the company s senior management or the failure to add or retain qualified management personnel could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
risks associated with cost containment initiatives 
the health care industry  including the dental services market  is experiencing a trend toward cost containment  as payors seek to impose lower reimbursement rates upon providers 
the company believes that this trend will continue and will increasingly affect the provision of dental services 
this may result in a reduction in per patient and per procedure revenue from historic levels 
significant reductions in payments to dentists or other changes in reimbursement by payors for dental services may have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
risks associated with capitated payment arrangements 
part of the company s growth strategy involves selectively obtaining capitated managed dental care contracts 
under a capitated managed dental care contract  the dental practice provides dental services to the members of the plan and receives a fixed monthly capitation payment for each plan member covered for a specific schedule of services regardless of the quantity or cost of services to the participating dental practice which is obligated to provide them  and may receive a co pay for each service provided 
this arrangement shifts the risk of utilization of such services to the dental group practice that provides the dental services 
because the company assumes responsibility under its management agreements for all aspects of the operation of the dental practices other than the practice of dentistry and thus bears all costs of the provision of dental services at the offices other than compensation and benefits of dentists and hygienists  the risk of over utilization of dental services at the offices under capitated managed dental care plans is effectively shifted to the company 
in contrast  under traditional indemnity insurance arrangements  the insurance company reimburses reasonable charges that are billed for the dental services provided 
in  the company derived approximately of its revenues from capitated managed dental care contracts  and of its revenues from associated co payments 
risks associated with capitated managed dental care contracts include principally i the risk that the capitation payments and any associated co payments do not adequately cover the costs of providing the dental services  ii the risk that one or more of the pcs may be terminated as an approved provider by managed dental care plans with which they contract  iii the risk that the company will be unable to negotiate future capitation arrangements on satisfactory terms with managed care dental plans  and iv the risk that large subscriber groups will terminate their relationship with such managed dental care plans which would reduce patient volume and capitation and co payment revenue 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to negotiate future capitation arrangements on behalf of pcs on satisfactory terms or at all  or that the fees offered in current capitation arrangements will not be reduced to levels unsatisfactory to the company 
moreover  to the extent that costs incurred by the company s affiliated dental practices in providing services to patients covered by capitated managed dental care contracts exceed the revenue under such contracts  the company s business  financial condition and operating results may be materially and adversely affected

risks of becoming subject to licensure 
federal and state laws regulate insurance companies and certain other managed care organizations 
many states  including colorado  also regulate the establishment and operation of networks of health care providers 
in most states  these laws do not apply to discounted fee for service arrangements 
these laws also do not generally apply to networks that are paid on a capitated basis  unless the entity with which the network provider is contracting is not a licensed health insurer or other managed care organization 
there are exceptions to these rules in some states 
for example  certain states require a license for a capitated arrangement with any party unless the risk bearing entity is a professional corporation that employs the professionals 
the company believes its current activities do not constitute the provision of insurance in colorado or new mexico  and thus  it is in compliance with the insurance laws of these states with respect to the operation of its offices 
there can be no assurance that these laws will not be changed or that interpretations of these laws by the regulatory authorities in those states  or in the states in which the company expands  will not require licensure or a restructuring of some or all of the company s operations 
in the event that the company is required to become licensed under these laws  the licensure process can be lengthy and time consuming and  unless the regulatory authority permits the company to continue to operate while the licensure process is progressing  the company could experience a material adverse change in its business while the licensure process is pending 
in addition  many of the licensing requirements mandate strict financial and other requirements  which the company may not immediately be able to meet 
further  once licensed  the company would be subject to continuing oversight by and reporting to the respective regulatory agency 
the regulatory framework of certain jurisdictions may limit the company s expansion into  or ability to continue operations within  such jurisdictions if the company is unable to modify its operational structure to conform to such regulatory framework 
any limitation on the company s ability to expand could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
risks arising from health care reform 
federal and state governments currently are considering various types of health care initiatives and comprehensive revisions to the health care and health insurance systems 
some of the proposals under consideration  or others that may be introduced  could  if adopted  have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
it is uncertain what legislative programs  if any will be adopted in the future  or what action congress or state legislatures may take regarding health care reform proposals or legislation 
in addition  changes in the health care industry  such as the growth of managed care organizations and provider networks  may result in lower payments for the services of the company s managed practices 
risks associated with intangible assets 
at december   intangible assets on the company s consolidated balance sheet were million  representing of the company s total assets at that date 
the company expects the amount allocable to intangible assets on its balance sheet to increase in the future in connection with additional acquisitions  which will increase the company s amortization expense 
in the event of any sale or liquidation of the company or a portion of its assets  there can be no assurance that the value of the company s intangible assets will be realized 
in addition  the company continually evaluates whether events and circumstances have occurred indicating that any portion of the remaining balance of the amount allocable to the company s intangible assets may not be recoverable 
when factors indicate that the amount allocable to the company s intangible assets should be evaluated for possible impairment  the company may be required to reduce the carrying value of such assets 
any future determination requiring the write off of a significant portion of unamortized intangible assets could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
possible exposure to professional liability 
in recent years  dentists have become subject to an increasing number of lawsuits alleging malpractice 
some of these lawsuits involve large claims and significant defense costs 
any suits involving the company or dentists at the offices  if successful  could result in substantial damage awards that may exceed the limits of the company s insurance coverage 
the company provides practice management services  it does not engage in the practice of dentistry or control the practice of dentistry by the dentists or their compliance with regulatory requirements directly applicable to providers 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will not become subject to litigation in the future as a result of the dental services provided at the offices 
the company maintains professional liability insurance for itself and provides for professional liability insurance covering dentists  hygienists and dental assistants at the offices 
while the company believes it has adequate liability insurance coverage  there can be no assurance that the coverage will be adequate to cover losses or that coverage will continue to be available upon terms satisfactory to the company 
in addition  certain types of risks and liabilities  including penalties and fines imposed by governmental agencies  are not covered by insurance 
malpractice insurance  moreover  can be expensive and varies from state to state 
successful malpractice claims could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results

risks associated with non competitio covenants and other arrangements with managing dentists 
the management agreements require the pcs to enter into employment agreements with dentists which include non competition provisions typically for three to five years after termination of employment within a specified geographic area  usually a specified number of miles from the relevant office  and restrict solicitation of employees and patients 
in colorado  covenants not to compete are prohibited by statute with certain exceptions 
permitted covenants not to compete are enforceable in colorado only to the extent their terms are reasonable in both duration and geographic scope 
arizona and new mexico courts have enforced covenants not to compete if their terms are found to be reasonable 
it is thus uncertain whether a court will enforce a covenant not to compete in those states in a given situation 
in addition  there is little judicial authority regarding whether a practice management agreement will be viewed as the type of protectable business interest that would permit it to enforce such a covenant or to require a pc to enforce such covenants against dentists formerly employed by the pc since the intangible value of a management agreement depends primarily on the ability of the pc to preserve its business  which could be harmed if employed dentists went into competition with the pc  a determination that the covenants not to compete contained in the employment agreements between the pc and its employed dentists are unenforceable could have a material adverse impact on the company 
see items and business and properties affiliation model employment agreements 
in addition  the company is a party to various agreements with managing dentists who own the pcs  which restrict the dentists ability to transfer the shares in the pcs see items and business and properties affiliation model relationship with pcs there can be no assurance that these agreements will be enforceable in a given situation 
a determination that these agreements are not enforceable could have a material adverse impact on the company 
seasonality 
the company s past financial results have fluctuated somewhat due to seasonal variations in the dental service industry  with revenue typically declining in the fourth calendar quarter 
the company expects this seasonal fluctuation to continue in the future 
competition 
the dental practice management segment of the dental services industry is highly competitive and is expected to become increasingly more competitive 
there are several dental practice management companies that are operating in the company s markets 
there are also a number of companies with dental practice management businesses similar to that of the company currently operating in other parts of the country which may enter the company s existing markets in the future 
as the company seeks to expand its operations into new markets  it is likely to face competition from dental practice management companies  which already have established a strong business presence in such locations 
the company s competitors may have greater financial or other resources or otherwise enjoy competitive advantages  which may make it difficult for the company to compete against them or to acquire additional offices on terms acceptable to the company 
see items and business and properties competition 
the business of providing general dental and specialty dental services is highly competitive in the markets in which the company operates 
competition for providing dental services may include practitioners who have more established practices and reputations 
the company competes against established practices in the retention and recruitment of general dentists  specialists  hygienists and other personnel 
if the availability of such dentists  specialists  hygienists and other personnel begins to decline in the company s markets  it may become more difficult to attract qualified dentists  specialists  hygienists and other personnel 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete effectively against other existing practices or against new single or multi specialty dental practices that enter its markets  or to compete against such practices in the recruitment and retention of qualified dentists  specialists  hygienists and other personnel 
see items and business and properties competition 
volatility of stock price 
the market price of the common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarterly variations in operating results of the company or its competitors  changes in earnings estimates by analysts  developments in the industry or changes in general economic conditions 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the financial position  results of operations or cash flows of the company due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices and rates 
the company is exposed to market risk in the area of changes in united states interest rates 
historically and as of december   the company has not used derivative instruments or engaged in hedging activities 
interest rate risk 
the interest payable on the company s line of credit is variable based upon the libor rate and the prime rate and  therefore  affected by changes in market interest rates 
at december   million was outstanding with an interest rate of libor plus and  was outstanding with an interest rate of prime plus 
the company may repay the balance in full at any time without penalty 
as a result  the company does not believe that any reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates would result in a material effect on future earnings  fair values or cash flows of the company 
based on calculations performed by the company  a increase in the interest rate on the company s credit facility would have resulted in additional interest expense of approximately  for the twelve months ended december
