specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described in the following paragraphs 
for all of these policies  we caution that future events rarely develop precisely as forecast  and estimates routinely require adjustment and may require material adjustment 
revenue recognition we have many different revenue streams with different revenue recognition policies 
we record retail and online tax preparation revenues when a completed return is filed or accepted by the customer 
ral participation revenue is recorded when we purchase our participation interest in the ral 
commission revenue is recognized on a trade date basis 
business services revenues are recognized on a time and materials basis 
we recognize interest income on customer margin loan balances daily as earned  based on current rates charged to customers for their margin balance 
accretion income represents interest earned over the life of residual interests using the effective interest method 
we record sales of software when the product is ultimately sold to the end user 
pom revenues are deferred and recognized over the term of the guarantee based upon historic and actual payment of claims 

table of contents form k h r block franchise royalties  which are based upon the contractual percentages of franchise revenues  are recorded in the period in which the franchise provides the service 
gains on sales of mortgage loans we sell substantially all of the non prime mortgage loans we originate to the trusts  which are qualifying special purpose entities qspes  with servicing rights generally retained 
prime mortgage loans are sold in whole loan sales  servicing released  to third party buyers 
we record the gain on sale as the difference between cash proceeds and the allocated cost of loans sold 
we determine the allocated cost of loans sold based on the relative fair values of loans sold  msrs and the beneficial interest in trusts  which represents the ultimate expected outcome from the disposition of the loans 
the relative fair value of the msrs and the beneficial interest in trust is determined using discounted cash flow models  which require various management assumptions see discussion below in valuation of residual interests and valuation of mortgage servicing rights 
variations in these assumptions affect the estimated fair values  which would affect the reported gains on sales 
gains on sales of mortgage loans totaled million  million and million for fiscal years  and  respectively 
see discussion in off balance sheet financing related to the disposition of the loans by the trusts and subsequent securitization by the company 
valuation of residual interests we use discounted cash flow models to arrive at the estimated fair values of our residual interests
