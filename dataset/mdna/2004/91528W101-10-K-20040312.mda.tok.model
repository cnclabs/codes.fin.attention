net interest income net interest income  the primary source of earnings for the company  is the difference between interest and loan fee income generated on interest earning assets and the interest expense paid on deposits and borrowed funds 
the amount of net interest income is affected by both changes in the level of interest rates and the amount and composition of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
for this discussion  net interest income is presented on a fully tax equivalent fte basis which restates interest on tax exempt securities and loans as if such interest was subject to federal income tax at the statutory rate 
for  net interest income declined to  from  in total interest income decreased to  in  compared to  for the same period in the decrease was primarily related to the record low rate environment throughout and was partially offset by the increase in average interest earning assets added from the merger with unb corp 
during  the yield on interest earning assets declined by basis points from the same period in the company s yield on average loans was in and for the comparable year ago period 
the yield on loans continued to be impacted by sustained lower market rates throughout and as a result a large portion of the loan portfolio automatically repriced or borrowers chose to refinance to lower rates 
in addition  the yield on loans was impacted during by faster than projected amortization of the purchase accounting adjustments associated with the mark to market of unb corp 
s loan portfolio at the time of the merger of equals between unb corp 
and bancfirst ohio corp 
in march of with the low rate environment and the subsequent refinancing of many of these loans  the amortization of the premiums was faster than originally projected 
during   of amortization was originally projected  but  was actually recognized during the year 
it is anticipated that with the increase in rates and a steeper yield curve  the refinancing of these loans should slow and thus the amortization of these premiums should have less of an impact on the yield on loans in subsequent periods 
however  these loans could continue to refinance or pay down at higher than anticipated speeds  thus impacting the yield on loans because of the additional amortization of the premium 
the yield on the securities portfolio decreased from in to during the decrease in the yield on securities continued to be impacted by lower market rates throughout and also  during  the securities portfolio experienced significant pre payments on collateralized mortgage obligations and mortgage backed securities which impacted the amortization of the premiums on these securities and resulted in more cash flows being reinvested at lower market rates 
in the fourth quarter of  there was a slow down in the pre payment speeds on securities and management anticipates that the yield on the securities portfolio will not be impacted as greatly by premium amortization given the current interest rate environment 

table of contents total interest expense decreased to  in  compared to  in the decrease in cost of funds was primarily from lower market rates affecting the rates paid on all deposit products and the cost of borrowings which was partially offset by the increase in average interest bearing liabilities added from the merger with unb corp 
the company s cost of interest bearing liabilities decreased to in compared to for the same period of the company has been limited in its ability to further reduce the cost of its interest bearing liabilities as deposit spreads have narrowed in this sustained low market rate environment combined with the fixed term nature of its borrowings 
during the third quarter of   of fixed rate federal home loan bank fhlb advances were paid off prior to their scheduled maturity dates as part of a strategy to help lower the future cost of funds 
the pre payment penalty of  increased the cost of interest bearing liabilities by basis points in the cost of interest bearing liabilities was also impacted by a deposit campaign in that brought in long term certificates of deposit as part of a balance sheet strategy to reduce its risk profile and partially mitigate its exposure in a rising rate environment 
also  in february through april of  the bank instituted an aggressive campaign to grow core deposits  specifically money market savings and interest bearing checking accounts that were promoted with a day introductory rate 
based on the current historically low level of rates  the company will have limited opportunities to further decrease rates on deposits 
in  the increase in net interest income to  from  in  was attributed to the growth in average interest earning assets due to the merger with unb corp 
in  the yield on interest earning assets declined by basis points which was offset by a basis point reduction in the cost of funds 
the company tries to maintain a neutral interest rate risk position to minimize the impact of changes in rates on net interest income and the net interest margin 
if rates continue to decline in  the net interest margin is likely to decline 
borrowers will have the option to pre pay or refinance existing loans  but the company will have less opportunity to decrease rates on deposits since they are near historical lows 
if rates increase  variable rate loans will reprice upward  but could be offset by similar increases in deposit rates  resulting in a flat to declining net interest margin rate 
loan fees in the amount of   and  were included in interest on loans for the years ended december   and  respectively 
net interest margin  the measure of the net yield on average interest earning assets on a fte basis  is calculated by dividing net interest income on a fte basis by average interest earning assets 
the following table presents  for each period indicated  the total dollar amount of interest income from average interest earning assets and the resultant yields  as well as the interest expense on average interest bearing liabilities  expressed both in dollars and percentage rates  and the net interest margin 
the net interest margin is affected by the level and mix of interest earning assets  the proportion funded by non interest versus interest bearing liabilities  and the interest rate spread between them 
all average balances are average daily balances 
non accruing loans are included in average loan balances

the company s net interest margin decreased by basis points to in from in  and by basis points from the net interest margin rate of 
the decline in the net interest margin in was primarily due to the yields on interest earning assets declining faster than the cost of interest bearing liabilities 
in  the improvement in the net interest margin was primarily from lower cost of funds due to the decline in market interest rates and due to a change in funding mix as a result of the merger 
net interest income may also be analyzed by segregating the volume and rate components of interest income and interest expense

net security gains of  were recognized in compared with in  and in security gains of  were recognized as a part of the company s management of the securities portfolio and overall balance sheet risk management strategy 
various securities transactions were executed during the year with the primary objective of reducing the company s exposure to continued high levels of pre payments in its mortgage backed securities portfolio and to take advantage of the narrowing of spreads in the corporate bond market 
in addition to these transactions  net gains of  were recognized on the sale of trust preferred and equity securities that were sold in order to lessen the company s credit exposure to specific issuers

asset quality to maintain the level of credit risk of the loan portfolio at an appropriate level  management sets underwriting standards and internal lending limits and provides for proper diversification of the portfolio by placing constraints on the concentration of credits within the portfolio 
in monitoring the level of credit risk within the loan portfolio  management utilizes a formal loan review process to monitor  review  and consider relevant factors in evaluating specific credits in determining the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses 
the company formally documents its evaluation of the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis and the evaluations are approved by its board of directors 
failure to receive principal and interest payments when due on any loan results in efforts to restore such loan to current status 
loans are classified as non accrual when  in the opinion of management  full collection of principal and accrued interest is in doubt 
the loans must be brought current and kept current for six sustained payments before being considered for removal from non accrual status 
continued unsuccessful collection efforts generally lead to initiation of foreclosure or other legal proceedings 
property acquired by the company as a result of foreclosure  or by deed in lieu of foreclosure  is classified as other assets owned until such time as it is sold or otherwise disposed 
the company owned  of such property at december  and  at december  when loans are charged off  any accrued interest recorded in the current fiscal year is charged against interest income

while this has increased delinquencies and non performing assets  management believes there is little risk of loss as these submissions are eventually processed 
the remaining increase in non performing loans resulted primarily from delinquency trends in general 
residential delinquency trends are consistent with ohio and national trends  bankruptcies have increased  and are a significant part of non performing loans 
while this has caused increased delinquencies and non performing assets  there continues to be little translation into losses 
management continues to remain cautious as the economic uncertainty extends and record levels of bankruptcies continue 

table of contents management of the company is not aware of any material amounts of loans outstanding  not disclosed in the tables below  for which management is aware of the borrower s inability to comply with present payment terms

as of december   impaired loans were  compared with  at december  commercial  commercial real estate and aircraft loans are classified as impaired if full collection of principal and interest in accordance with the terms of the loan documents is not probable 
in addition  as of december   there were  of loans classified as potential problem loans that were not classified as impaired or non performing 
potential problem loans include loans which management has some doubt as to the borrowers ability to comply with the present repayment terms and loans which management is actively monitoring due to changes in the borrowers financial condition 
impaired loans  non performing loans and potential problem loans have been considered in management s analysis of the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses 
as of december   the aircraft portfolio of  represented of the total loan portfolio 
management continues to carefully analyze the aircraft portfolio and the risk profile of the portfolio especially in light of decreasing collateral values in certain classes of aircraft 
the aircraft portfolio consists of  of non jet aircraft and values of non jet aircrafts have historically been more stable than jet aircrafts 
the remainder of the portfolio consists of loans secured by jets 
these loans are predominately to businesses that use their planes as a business tool and not actually within the aircraft industry  ie charters or flight schools  thus reducing the bank s exposure to the aircraft industry as a whole 
the bank s sales activity and marketing efforts continue to be on non jet aircraft  such as single engine and piston twin aircraft with values predominately under provision and allowance for loan losses management maintains the allowance for loan losses at a level considered appropriate for probable losses within the loan portfolio 
the amount of the provision for loan losses charged to operating expense is the amount necessary  in the opinion of management  to maintain the balance in the allowance for loan losses at an appropriate level 
the allowance is assessed based on historical experience  changes in portfolio size and mix  the relative quality of the loan portfolio  current and anticipated loan growth and economic conditions 
information about specific borrower situations  including their financial position and collateral values  are also important as well as assessments of current and future economic conditions  and other factors and estimates  which are subject to change over time 
specific borrower situations are based on a continuous analysis of loans by internal credit rating 
the historical experience assessment is based upon a loss migration analysis that assesses the amount of loss likely based upon loan category and internal credit rating 
the loss migration analysis is performed periodically and loss factors are updated regularly based upon actual experience

the increase in provision for loan losses for the year ended also increased as a result of the company adopting the allowance for loan loss methodology of unb corp 
it is common for merged companies to adopt one set of policies and as a result the calculation called for a higher provision amount during this led to an increase in specific allocations recognized based on an analysis of the credit quality of specific credits and an increase in the non specific allocation based on management s review of current economic conditions and portfolio trends 
net charge offs for increased by from  to  and increased by  from to  to  the ratio of net charge offs as a percentage of average loans outstanding was  and for  and  respectively 
consumer charge offs increased due to the general delinquency trends and increased bankruptcies that were previously discussed 
while these trends have not translated into proportionate losses within real estate secured portfolios  losses have increased in the consumer loan portfolio  primarily for loans secured with automobiles 
the bank has raised underwriting guidelines to mitigate these losses prospectively 
the allowance for loan losses is allocated according to the amount systematically estimated as necessary to provide for the inherent losses within the various categories of loans 
general allocations of the allowance are based primarily on previous charge off experience adjusted for changes in the risk characteristics of each category 
consumer loan allocations increased considerably in based upon the increased charge off experience previously discussed  while commercial and commercial real estate loan allocations decreased based

all of the company s assets  which include various risk weighted percentages of assets on the balance sheet  as well as off balance sheet exposures  are expressed as a percentage of risk adjusted assets and compared to its capital 
tier capital consists of shareholders equity and other items such as mandatory convertible debt and the allowance for loan losses 
as of december   unizan financial corp 
had a total risk based capital ratio of and a tier capital ratio of and unizan bank  national association had a total risk based capital ratio of and a tier capital ratio of 
both of these risk based capital ratios are well above minimum regulatory requirements 
in addition to risk based capital  a leverage ratio test must also be met 
this ratio evaluates capital adequacy on the basis of tier capital to total assets unadjusted for risk 
on december   unizan financial corp 
s leverage ratio was and unizan bank  national association leverage ratio was  which substantially exceeds the minimum regulatory requirement 
the capital securities held by bfoh capital trust i qualify as tier capital for the company under the federal reserve board s regulatory framework 
the federal reserve board is currently evaluating whether the capital securities continue to qualify as tier capital due to deconsolidation of the related trust preferred entity 
if the federal reserve board disqualifies the capital securities as tier capital  the effect of such a change could have a material impact on the company s regulatory capital ratios 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  the company is exposed to interest rate risk caused by the differences in cash flows and repricing characteristics that occur in various assets and liabilities as a result of changes in interest rates 
the asset and liability management process is designed to measure and manage risk to limit variable levels of net interest income and net present value of equity under various interest rate scenarios 
the company uses a dynamic computer model to generate earnings simulations  duration and net present value forecasts and gap analyses  each of which measures interest rate risk from a different perspective 
the model incorporates a large number of assumptions  including the absolute level of future interest rates  the slope of the yield curve  various spread relationships  pre payment speeds  repricing opportunities  cash flow characteristics of instruments without contractual maturity dates and changes in the volumes of multiple loan  investment and deposit categories 
management believes that individually and in the aggregate these assumptions are reasonable  but the complexity of the simulation modeling process results in a sophisticated estimate  not a precise calculation of exposure 
one of the most significant assumptions is the assignment of deposit balances without a stated maturity date to specific time frames 
since these deposits are subject to withdrawal on demand and have rates that can be changed  they could be considered immediately repriceable and assigned to the shortest maturity  resulting in a significantly higher level of liability sensitivity 
however  actual practice indicates that balances are withdrawn and replaced over a much longer time frame  and rates are modified less frequently and in smaller increments 
table of contents than changes which occur in financial market rates 
the company uses an estimated average decay rate to approximate deposit behavior over the simulation time horizon 
as more data is developed over time  a statistical analysis of historical deposit behavior will replace the estimated average decay rates 
the model then applies a predetermined immediate parallel increase or decrease in the level of interest rates to forecast the impact on both net interest income and capital one year forward 
while this methodology provides a comprehensive appraisal of interest rate risk  it is not necessarily indicative of actual or expected financial performance 
changes in interest rates that affect the entire yield curve equally at a single point in time are not typical  and the company makes assumptions regarding the magnitude of changes that are applied to various deposit products 
the residential mortgage loan pre payment assumptions are based on industry medians and could differ from the company s actual results due to non financial pre payment incentives and other local factors 
the behavior of depositors is based on an analysis of historical changes in balances and might not fully reflect current attitudes toward other investment alternatives 
moreover  the model does not include any interim changes in strategy the company might instate in response to shifts in interest rates 
presented below is a comparison of interest rate risk as measured by forecasted changes in net interest income and the net present value of equity 
the percentage changes fall within the limits approved by the board of directors 
under the interest rate environment as of december   declining rate scenarios of more than basis points were not likely and therefore provided no meaningful results 
rate shock basis points net interest income net present value of equity net interest income net present value of equity base case interest rate risk can be managed by using a variety of techniques  including but not limited to  selling existing assets or repaying liabilities  pricing loans and deposits to attract preferred maturities and repricing terms and developing alternative sources of funding or structuring new products to hedge existing exposures 
in addition to these balance sheet strategies  the company can also use derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps  caps  and floors to manage the potential impact of adverse changes in interest rates 
the company has interest rate swaps on which it pays fixed rates and receives variable rates 
two of the swaps  which have a total notional principal of  were executed to convert variable rate borrowings to fixed rates to reduce the risk of increased interest expense in a rising rate environment 
they are recorded at a fair value of  with changes recognized in other comprehensive income 
also  the company initiated a program to provide long term fixed rate loans to commercial borrowers without incurring interest rate risk by executing simultaneous interest rate swaps 
at december   the notional value of swaps in this program totaled  at a fair value of for the year ended december    has been recognized in interest expense related to the interest rate swaps compared with  for the same period in the company also has a notional balance of  of options on the s p which offsets the equivalent risk of certificate of deposit liabilities that have a return contractually linked to the index 
the effective portion of the options and the embedded derivative are carried at a fair value of 
for the year to date  the company has recognized in current income for the ineffective portion of the derivative

a schedule of significant off balance sheet commitments at december  follows fixed rate commitments to extend credit variable rate commitments to extend credit variable rate standby letters of credit and financial guarantees small business administration loan commitments total commitments to extend credit are legally binding and have fixed expiration dates  usually one year or less  or other termination clauses 
the company s exposure to credit loss on commitments to extend credit  in the event of nonperformance by the counterparty  is represented by the contractual amounts of the commitments 
the company controls its exposure to loss from these commitments through the same credit approval processes and monitoring procedures it applies for loans and by obtaining collateral to secure commitments based on management s credit assessment of the counterparty 
collateral held by the company may include cash  accounts receivable  securities  and real or personal property 
the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent the company s future liquidity requirements  as many of the commitments expire without being drawn upon

liquidity management the objective of liquidity management is to ensure the availability of funds to accommodate customer loan demand as well as deposit withdrawals while continuously seeking higher yields from longer term lending and investing opportunities 
this is accomplished principally by maintaining sufficient cash flows and liquid assets along with consistent stable core deposits and the capacity to maintain immediate access to funds 
principal sources of liquidity include cash and cash equivalents  federal funds sold and the cash flows provided by maturities and amortizations in the loan and securities portfolios 
the ability to raise funds in the market place is provided through the bank s branch network  in addition to the availability of fhlb advance borrowings  brokered deposits  federal funds purchased  securities sold under agreement to repurchase and bank borrowings 
an important factor in the preservation of liquidity is the maintenance of public confidence  as this facilitates the retention and growth of a large  stable supply of core deposits

during  the company s strategy was to increase liquidity and reduce interest rate risk 
during the historically low market interest rate and high refinancing environment that existed during  the company sold long term fixed rate mortgage loan production rather than retain the loans in its portfolio

impact of inflation consolidated financial data included herein have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted gaap in the united states of america 
presently  gaap requires unizan financial corp 
to measure financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars  except for securities available for sale which are carried at fair value 
changes in the relative value of money due to inflation or recession are generally not considered 
in management s opinion  changes in interest rates affect the financial condition of unizan financial corp 
to a far greater degree than changes in the inflation rate 
while interest rates are greatly influenced by changes in the inflation rate  they do not move concurrently 
rather  interest rate volatility is based on changes in the expected rate of inflation  as well as changes in monetary and fiscal policy 
a financial institution s ability to be relatively unaffected by changes in interest rates is a good indicator of its capability to perform in a volatile economic environment 
in an effort to protect itself from the effects of interest rate volatility  unizan financial corp 
reviews its interest rate risk position frequently  monitoring its exposure and taking necessary steps to minimize any detrimental effects on the company s profitability 
critical accounting policies and the impact of accounting estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
note  summary of significant accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements describes the company s accounting and financial policies and should be reviewed in detail for an understanding of the company s financial performance 
on an on going basis  the company s management evaluates its estimates and judgments including those related to allowance for loan losses  fair value of securities  valuation allowance for mortgage servicing rights msrs  determination and carrying value of impaired loans  post retirement benefit obligations  depreciation of premises and equipment  carrying value and amortization or impairment of intangibles  realization of deferred 
table of contents income tax assets and fair value of financial instruments 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are those policies that require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the company has identified accounting for the allowance for loan losses and the valuation of msrs to be critical accounting policies 
loans are the largest category of assets on the company s balance sheet  representing over of total assets 
the company considers the accounting policy for allowance for loan losses to be a critical accounting policy because of the significance of the loan portfolio to the financial condition of the company  and because determining the allowance is a complex process involving difficult and subjective judgments  assumptions and estimates 
management analyzes the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses regularly 
the company records a provision necessary to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level sufficient to provide for probable incurred credit losses 
the provision is charged against earnings when it is established 
an allowance for loan losses is established based on management s best judgment  which involves an ongoing review of prevailing national and local economic conditions  changes in the size and composition of the portfolio and review of individual problem credits 
growth of the loan portfolio  loss experience  economic conditions  delinquency levels  credit mix  adequacy of collateral  and an evaluation of selected credits are factors that affect judgments concerning the appropriateness of the allowance 
actual losses on loans are charged against the allowance 
if the financial condition of the company s borrowers were to decline  resulting in an impairment of their abilities to make payments  or the value of collateral securing the loans were to decline  an increase in the allowance may be required 
a significant decline in the credit quality of the company s loan portfolio could have a material adverse affect on the company financial condition and results of operations 
the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements also requires the establishment of estimates related to the life of loans or the rate of principal repayment of loans  investment securities and loans sold to investors 
the life of a loan impacts the amortization of loan origination costs and mortgage servicing rights 
management has identified the valuation of msrs as a critical accounting policy 
the value of the msr portfolio is analyzed by management quarterly by considering critical assumptions for mortgage pre payment speeds  the targeted investor yield to a buyer of msrs  and float on escrows 
market interest rates are an external factor that can have a material influence on this valuation process  as interest rates influence pre payment speeds and targeted investor yield 
since the company amortizes deferred loan fees and costs over the estimated life of single family mortgage loans  an increase in the prepayment speed for those loans above the estimated rate will generally require the company to adjust its amortization 
likewise  when loans serviced for others prepay more rapidly than projected  the company will generally be required to record an impairment charge on msrs or retained interests 
due to historically low interest rates  the company has experienced a record rate of loan repayments over the past two years 
future impairment could be realized if pre payment speeds increase beyond assumption rates 
conversely  if rates rise and pre payment activity slows  the value of the msrs should be positively impacted
