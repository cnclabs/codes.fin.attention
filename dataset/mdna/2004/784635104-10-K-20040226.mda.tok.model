in addition  our estimates of future operating results are based on our current complement of businesses  which is constantly subject to change as we implement our grow  fix or sell strategy 
executive overview we are a global multi industry company that is focused on profitably growing a number of platform businesses that have scale and growth potential 
we are a global provider of technical products and systems  industrial products and services  flow technology  cooling technologies and services and service solutions 
we offer a diverse collection of products  which include fire detection and building life safety products  tv and radio broadcast antennas and towers  life science products and services  power transformers  compaction equipment  high tech die castings  dock products and systems  cooling towers  air filtration products  valves  back flow prevention and fluid handling equipment  and metering and mixing solutions 
our products and services also include specialty service tools  diagnostic systems  service equipment and technical information services 
our products are used by a broad array of customers in various industries  including chemical processing  pharmaceuticals  infrastructure  mineral processing  petrochemical  telecommunications  transportation and power generation 
we are a multinational corporation with operations in over countries and approximately  employees worldwide 
our strategy is to create market advantages through technology  service and product leadership by expanding our market focus to offer full customer solutions and by building critical mass through strategic bolt on acquisitions 
our business strategy is focused on an integrated leadership process that aligns performance measurement  decision support  compensation and communication 
the value improvement process is our core competence  and it continues to provide the framework for operating our businesses 
as part of our process  we continually review our platforms and selected markets under a grow  fix or sell framework 
we regularly review and negotiate potential acquisitions and divestitures in the ordinary course of business  some of which are or may be material  and have completed numerous acquisitions and divestitures over the last several years 
all of our decisions regarding acquisitions and divestitures are based on an economic cash flow model 
we may consider a larger acquisition  more than  in revenues  if certain criteria are met 
we also consider business divestitures when we believe the business has a better strategic fit with another company that increases the overall cash flow returns to our investors 
on may   we completed the acquisition of united dominion industries  or udi  for approximately  udi  which had sales of  for the twelve months ended december   manufactured products including electrical test and measurement solutions  cable and pipe locating devices  laboratory testing chambers  industrial ovens  electrodynamic shakers  air filtration and dehydration equipment  material handling devices  electric resistance heaters  soil  asphalt and landfill compactors  specialty farm machinery  pumps  valves  cooling towers  boilers  leak detection equipment  and aerospace components 
excluding udi  over the last three years we have invested in bolt on acquisitions including in for fourteen acquisitions 
although we may make acquisitions in each of our segments  over the last three years the majority of these transactions have been completed in our technical products and systems  cooling technologies and services and flow technology segments 
in the last three years we have realized proceeds from assets sales and business divestitures of  including in our primary divestitures in were the sale of our inrange technologies corporation inrange subsidiary in may and the sale of our interest in the assa abloy door joint venture in july 
in the first quarter of  as part of our ongoing strategic review process  we evaluated several alternatives for our inrange subsidiary  part of our technical products and systems segment  and concluded that it was a better strategic fit with another company 
therefore  on may   we completed the sale of our ownership of the outstanding shares of inrange to computer network technology corporation cnt 
our portion of the cash proceeds was  after a settlement of an inter company note payable by us to inrange 
see note of our consolidated financial statements for more information on acquisitions and divestitures 
we have accounted for inrange as a discontinued operation  in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment and disposal of long lived assets 
the results of inrange for all periods presented are included in the consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations 
in addition  unless otherwise indicated  amounts provided in this md a pertain to continuing operations only 
we incur special charges as a result of executing our strategy to rationalize and consolidate manufacturing capacity  better serve customer demand  fix or discontinue operations  integrate acquisition capacity and build flexible cost structures through outsourcing initiatives 
in  and  we have recorded special charges of  and  respectively 
these charges can vary significantly from period to period  and as a result  we may experience fluctuations in our reported net income and earnings per share due to the timing of restructuring actions 
in  we continued to focus on stable long term liquidity and aligning our capital structure so that we are well positioned to meet the needs of our business and take advantage of our growth opportunities 
we were recognized for our success in accomplishing these objectives with standard poors credit rating agency upgrading our senior credit facility rating to investment grade bbb in the first quarter of performance highlights related to our liquidity and capital resources for include the following we realized net cash from continuing operations of  a increase from in working capital provided an aggregate cash inflow of  including from non recourse sales of certain trade receivables  as compared to a working capital investment of in we also received in connection with the microsoft settlement in we realized cash flows of from asset and business sales including primarily the sale of inrange and our interest in our assa abloy door joint venture 
we repaid under existing debt agreements  issued in new eight year  non callable bonds at  and repurchased of our common stock and invested  net of cash acquired  in fourteen strategic bolt on acquisitions 
we ended with cash and equivalents of compared to at the end of and had no borrowings on our revolver at december  or in december  we announced the implementation of a quarterly dividend program 
the actual amount of each quarterly dividend  as well as each declaration date  record date and payment date  is subject to the discretion of the board  and the target dividend level may be adjusted during the year at the discretion of the board 
pursuant to the program  on february  our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of per common share  payable on april  to shareholders of record on march we continue to expand our customer offerings globally  increase our sourcing outside the us  and grow our operations overseas through partnerships and attractive  strategic bolt on acquisitions 
we will continue our strategy of developing technology based growth  building flexible cost structures and supplying full solutions by developing complementary products and value added services for our customers 
business segment information in  our cooling technologies business exceeded ten percent of total segment revenue 
as a result  and in accordance with sfas no 
 we have begun reporting the results of cooling technologies and services as a separate reportable business segment 
as required by sfas no 
 the determination of the ten percent threshold should be evaluated in connection with future prospects and not necessarily on the current indicators only 
based on current forecasts  including the acquisition of hamon cie global dry and nafta wet cooling businesses in december  we believe the cooling technologies business will continue to exceed the ten percent threshold criteria established by sfas no 
all prior periods presented have been restated to separate cooling technologies and services from our flow technology segment 
for more information on the results of our segments see note of our consolidated financial statements 
technical products and systems our technical products and systems segment focuses on solving customer problems with complete technology based systems and services 
our emphasis is on growth through investment in new technology  new product introductions  alliances and acquisitions 
this segment includes operating units that design  manufacture and market laboratory and life science products and services  security and integrated building life safety systems and services  broadcast and communications systems  and electrical test and measurement solutions 
industrial products and services the strategy of our industrial products and services segment is to provide productivity solutions for industry 
this segment emphasizes introducing new related services and products  as well as focusing on the replacement parts and service elements of the segment 
this segment includes operating units that design  manufacture and market power systems  compaction equipment  engineered components and subsystems  dock products and systems and heat and ventilation products 
flow technology our flow technology segment designs  manufactures and markets solutions and products that are used to process or transport fluids  as well as solutions and products used in heat transfer applications and air flow treatment systems 
this segment includes operating units that design and manufacture cooling process and fluid handling equipment and boilers and hydronic products 
cooling technologies and services our cooling technologies and services segment designs  manufactures and services cooling products for markets throughout the world 
offering both dry and wet cooling systems  this segment provides a diverse offering of products for power generation  refrigeration  heating  ventilation and air conditioning and industrial markets 
this business is currently focused on expanding its global reach in service and large cooling tower reconstruction  and on further expanding its dry cooling manufacturing in china 
service solutions our service solutions segment consists of three primary units diagnostic systems and service equipment  specialty tools  and technical information and services 
the strategy of this segment is to focus on the design  manufacture and marketing of a wide range of specialty service tools  hand held diagnostic systems and service equipment  inspection gauging systems  and technical and training information  primarily for the franchised vehicle dealer industry in north america and europe 
we intend to grow this business by developing new service capabilities and strengthening alliances in hand held diagnostics 
major customers are franchised dealers of motor vehicle manufacturers  aftermarket vehicle service facilities and independent distributors 
joint venture we have one significant joint venture  egs electrical group  llc  with emerson electric co 
in which we hold a interest 
egs operates primarily in the united states  canada and mexico and is engaged in the manufacture of electrical fittings  hazardous location lighting  and power conditioning products 
we account for our investment under the equity method of accounting  on a three month lag basis 
we typically receive the majority of our share of this joint venture s earnings in cash dividends 
seasonality  competition and trends many of our businesses closely follow changes in the industries and end markets that they serve 
in addition  certain businesses have seasonal fluctuations 
our technical products and systems and flow technology segments tend to be stronger during the third and fourth quarters due to the purchasing patterns of customers at these businesses 
our industrial products and services segment is usually strongest in the second quarter due primarily to the seasonal demand for products of the compaction equipment division reported in this segment 
demand for products in our cooling technologies and services segment is highly correlated to contract timing on large construction contracts  which may cause significant fluctuations from period to period 
our service solutions segment revenues primarily follow program launch timing for diagnostic systems and service equipment  the largest unit in this segment 
in aggregate  our businesses generally tend to be stronger in the second half of the year  particularly in the fourth quarter 
although our businesses operate in highly competitive markets  our competitive position cannot be determined accurately in the aggregate or by segment since our competitors do not offer all of the same product lines or serve all of the same markets 
in addition  specific reliable comparative figures are not available for many of our competitors 
in most product groups  competition comes from numerous concerns  both large and small 
the principal methods of competition are price  service  product performance and technical innovations 
these methods vary with the type of product sold 
we believe we can compete effectively on the basis of each of these factors as they apply to the various products we offer 
see item business for discussion of competitors by business 
in  we reported revenues of  compared to  in  an increase of 
organic revenues  which are revenues excluding acquisitions or dispositions  declined approximately in compared to the decline in organic revenues was a result of many factors including  but not limited to global economic conditions  particularly conditions in us industrial markets  the negative impact of volume and pricing dynamics at our power systems businesses  due to reduced demand in us capital spending for power transmission  and lower volumes in our broadcast communication systems and services business  due to regulatory delays in the introduction of hdtv broadcast antennas in the us market 
partially offsetting the decline was strong organic growth at our cooling technologies and services and service solutions segments 
approximately of our revenues were generated from non us countries in accordingly  we are subject to the translation impact of changes in the us dollar relative to other global currencies 
the primary foreign currencies where we do business are the euro  sterling and canadian dollar 
in  favorable currency translation is estimated to have increased reported revenues by approximately 
the following table highlights our primary platforms performance in the markets they serve  including the impact of currency translation  and our expectations for based on information available at the time of this report 
we define forecasted trends as follows growth future end market performance is expected to be above the prior year  flat future end market performance is expected to be flat compared to the prior year  decline future end market performance is expected to be below the prior year 
primary platforms that experienced organic revenue growth for the year are summarized below 
segment platform annual forecasted trend comments technical products and systems security and integrated building life safety systems growth organic revenues for this platform increased low single digits 
organic revenues for our building life safety business  edwards systems technology  increased mid single digits as new product introductions  market share gains and growth in europe offset softness in us non residential building construction 
organic revenues at our security protection business declined nearly 
this decline was due primarily to a reduction in domestic security spending from the levels experienced for the period immediately following september  we expect growth in the end markets for this platform in from the increased demand for high end fire detection products  new product introductions and improved demand for global government security services 
industrial products and services compaction equipment flat this platform reported organic revenue growth of due primarily to the favorable translation impact of the strength of the euro relative to the us dollar and market share gains in asia 
these favorable trends have offset softness in the road construction markets and pricing pressures due to the strong euro 
we expect these trends to continue in this platform is highly seasonal by quarter  with the second quarter being the highest revenue period in the year 
cooling technologies and services cooling  thermal and resource management systems  products  reconstruction and services 
growth organic revenue growth of was experienced in soft demand in the us power market was offset by the global demand for large construction cooling technology products and reconstruction services 
we expect that the growth trend will continue in at a more moderate level than the prior year 
service solutions specialty tools and technical information and services flat organic revenues increased high single digits compared to the prior year 
the primary demand for products in this platform is driven by new vehicle model introductions  new vehicle technology  such as integrated electronics  and regulatory changes 
lower demand for oem dealer tools in is expected to be offset by stronger aftermarket tool sales  service offerings and new product introductions 
primary platforms that experienced organic revenue declines for the year are summarized below 
segment platform annual forecasted trend comments technical products and systems broadcast and communication systems and services decline organic revenues decreased in extensions granted by the fcc have caused delays in the hdtv roll out 
the timing associated with the delays in the hdtv roll out remain uncertain as regulatory decisions and legislative actions are pending in this market with respect to broadcast customers 
this platform has been positioned to provide turnkey systems to the broadcast market and  while there is still uncertainty regarding the timing of the hdtv roll out in our favorable long term view of this market remains unchanged 
laboratory and life science products growth organic revenues were down slightly  with future organic revenue growth expected for this unit 
kendro  the primary business in this platform  experienced flat organic revenues 
we expect capital spending demand in the laboratory and life science markets to be supplemented with new repository business  as well as with continued demand for bio preparation  processing and storage equipment and new product introductions 
industrial products and services power systems flat power generation end markets continue to experience reduced demand and pricing pressures 
accordingly  our power systems unit experienced a sharp decline in revenues with organic revenues declining approximately 
the impact of lower product revenues  market pricing and the delay of certain engineering  service and construction contracts significantly reduced profits 
based on current information  we believe that volumes and pricing have stabilized 
specialty engineered products flat this platform experienced low single digit revenue decline 
increased demand for aerospace defense components was offset by declines in filtration products  material handling dock loading applications  high integrity castings  heating and ventilation products and hydraulic power tools 
the demand for car and light truck vehicles in the us strongly influences the demand for filtration and high integrity casting products included in this platform 
we expect organic revenues for this platform to remain consistent with historical levels 
flow technology fluid systems flat this platform experienced low single digit organic decline as demand for boilers and hydronic products offset lower revenues for valves  process equipment and air filtration products 
we expect cyclical demand for short cycle products in power  chemical and mineral processing and industrial markets to remain soft through accounting policies and use of estimates revenue recognition we recognize revenues from product sales upon shipment to the customer  except for revenues from service contracts and long term maintenance arrangements  which are deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the agreement period  and revenues from certain construction and installation contracts  which are recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
under the percentage of completion method  revenue is recognized based on effort or costs incurred to date as compared to total estimated effort or cost of the total contract 
we realize profit at the time revenue is recognized based on our estimates as to the project status and the costs remaining to complete a particular project 
these estimates and actual experience may vary based on design changes  engineering change orders  cost over or under runs and other related events 
in  we recognized approximately of revenue under the percentage of completion method 
certain sales to distributors made with return rights and or price protection features are recognized upon shipment to the customer 
expected returns under these agreements are approximately of total revenues  can be reasonably estimated and are accrued for at the time of sale  and either a restocking charge is assessed on a return up to of sales price  or the customer must issue a replacement order before the return is authorized 
amounts billed for shipping and handling are included in revenue 
in addition  costs incurred for shipping and handling are recorded in cost of products sold and not netted against amounts billed 
employee benefit plans we have defined benefit pension plans that cover a significant portion of our salaried and hourly paid employees  including certain employees in foreign countries 
beginning in january  we discontinued providing pension benefits generally to newly hired employees 
in addition  we no longer provide service credits to certain active participants 
of the us employees covered by a defined account benefit pension and actively accruing a benefit  most are covered by an account balance plan or are part of a collectively bargained plan 
we have domestic postretirement plans that provide health and life insurance benefits for certain retirees and their dependents 
some of these plans require retiree contributions at varying rates 
not all retirees are eligible to receive these benefits  with eligibility governed by the plan s in effect at a particular location 
effective january   we implemented a uniform plan design for certain non union employees retiring after january  also effective january   we implemented a minimum employee contribution for all current  non union retirees 
certain of our non north american subsidiaries have similar plans for retirees 
our obligations for such plans are not material and are not included in this disclosure 
on december   the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of the act  was signed into law 
the act introduces a prescription drug benefit under medicare as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide prescription drug benefits that is at least actuarially equivalent to the medicare benefit offered under the act 
in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued financial staff position fsp sfas no 
accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of in accordance with fsp sfas no 
 we have elected to defer accounting for the effects of the act as specific authoritative guidance on the accounting for the federal subsidy is pending and that guidance  when issued  could require us to change previously reported information 
as a result  any measures of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation or net periodic postretirement benefit cost in these financial statements do not reflect the effects of the act on our plans 
based on certain provisions of our current postretirement plans  we believe we will be eligible to receive economic benefit from the act  however we are currently not able to quantify an amount 
we recorded net pension income of in  in and in the calculation of pension benefit income uses an expected rate of return on plan assets 
the difference between the estimated return and the actual return is treated as an unrecognized gain or loss  and this amount is amortized into the calculation of pension results in future periods 
the aggregate unrecognized loss position of our pension plans was and at december  and december   respectively 
the unrecognized loss position of our plans was favorably impacted in by the actual returns of plans assets  which exceeded our assumed returns 
however  historic lows in long term interest rates required a decrease in our discount rate assumption  which had a negative impact on the unrecognized loss position 
future net pension income or expense is dependent upon many factors  including level of employee participation in the plans  plan amendments  actuarial assumptions and the changes in market value of the plans assets  which  in turn  depends on a variety of economic conditions 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that future periods will include similar amounts of net pension income 
based on an assumed expected long term rate of return on assets of for and our current unrecognized loss position  we expect net pension income to decrease by approximately in the funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors  including returns on invested assets and the level of market interest rates 
the funded status of our pension plans as of december  has improved since december  as a result of the recent improvement in the performance of the us financial markets 
however  our funded status continues to be negatively impacted by the sustained historic lows in long term interest rates 
our german and other non funded pension plans account for of the current underfunded status  as these plans are typically not funded  in accordance with local regulations 
the underfunded status of our primary domestic pension plans did not have any impact on required cash contributions in we fund us pension plans in amounts equal to the minimum funding requirements of the employee retirement income security act of  plus additional amounts that may be approved from time to time 
we did not make any contributions to our primary domestic plans in in  we do not expect to make any payments to our primary domestic pension plans 
an additional minimum pension liability adjustment is required when the accumulated benefit obligation of a plan exceeds plan assets and accrued pension liabilities 
this adjustment also requires the elimination of any previously recorded prepaid pension asset 
the minimum liability adjustment  less allowable intangible assets  is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
however  in a year in which the plan assets exceed the accumulated benefit obligation of the plan  any pension adjustments previously recorded as a component of other accumulated other comprehensive income are removed and any net prepaid pension asset is restored 
as a result of the improved funded status of our pension plan for reasons described above  we were required to record a prepaid asset at december  this adjustment required the elimination of a portion of the minimum pension liability recorded as a result of the under funded position at december  we recorded this non cash  non income statement adjustment  net of tax  as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated statement of shareholders equity 
the total pension adjustment amount recorded to the accumulated other comprehensive income account at december  was  net of tax 
actuarial assumptions used in accounting for our pension plans are as follows year ended december  weighted average actuarial assumptions used in determining net periodic pension income discount rate rate of increase in compensation levels expected long term rate of return on assets domestic pension plans expected long term rate of return on assets foreign pension plans weighted average actuarial assumptions used in determining year end benefit obligations discount rate rate of increase in compensation levels it is our policy to review the pension assumptions annually 
pension benefit income or expense is determined using assumptions as of the beginning of the year  while the funded status is determined using assumptions as of the end of the year 
the assumptions are determined by management and established at the respective balance sheet date using the following principles the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is established based upon historical actual asset returns and the expectations of asset returns over the expected period to fund participant benefits based on the current investment mix of our plans  the discount rate is set based on the yield of high quality fixed income investments expected to be available in the future when pension benefits are paid high quality fixed income investments are commonly defined as fixed income investments with at least a moody s aa credit rating  and the rate of increase in compensation levels is established based on management s expectations of current and foreseeable future increases in compensation 
in addition  management also considers advice from independent actuaries 
a benchmark study completed by our independent actuaries has shown that our choice of assumptions is comparable to other organizations with a measurement date of december  a one percentage point increase or decrease to the assumed expected long term rate of return of our primary domestic pension plans would have a relative effect on net pension income 
the expected long term rate of return assumption for the pension benefit income calculation is expected to be approximately 
special and other charges as part of our business strategy  we right size and consolidate operations to drive results 
additionally  due to our acquisition strategy  from time to time we alter our business model to better serve customer demand  fix or discontinue lower margin product lines and rationalize and consolidate manufacturing capacity 
as a result  we recorded charges of in  in and in these special charges were primarily for restructuring initiatives to consolidate manufacturing and sales facilities  reduce our work force  rationalize certain product lines and recognize asset and goodwill impairments 
additionally  we recorded other charges to cost of products sold of in and in  primarily for discontinued product lines and other product changes associated with restructuring initiatives 
the purpose of our restructuring initiatives is to improve profitability  streamline operations  reduce costs and improve efficiency 
we believe that we will achieve operating cost reductions in and beyond through reduced employee and manufacturing costs and other facility overhead 
the estimated period in which we realize savings on our restructuring actions is on average approximately twelve months from the date of completion 
for restructuring actions announced in  we estimate that cost savings in the twelve months following the date of completion will be approximately to estimated cost savings will be realized in cost of products sold and selling  general and administrative expenses 
we continually review whether events and circumstances subsequent to the acquisition of any long lived assets  including definite lived intangible assets  have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful lives of those assets may warrant revision or that the remaining balance of those assets may not be recoverable 
we also continually review whether triggering events have occurred during the year and annually test for impairment to determine whether the carrying value exceeds the implied fair value of indefinite lived intangibles 
if events and circumstances indicate that the long lived assets  including intangible assets subject to amortization and indefinite lived intangibles should be reviewed for possible impairment  we use projections to assess whether future cash flows or operating income before amortization on a non discounted basis related to the tested assets are likely to exceed the recorded carrying amount of those assets to determine if a write down is appropriate 
if impairment is identified  a loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value of the impaired assets exceeds their fair value 
these special and other charges can vary significantly from period to period and as a result  we may experience fluctuations in our reported net income and earnings per share due to the timing of restructuring actions 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion on our special and other charges 
stock based compensation we have a stock based compensation plan  including stock options  restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards 
we account for our stock based employee compensation under accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and  accordingly  except for restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards  we do not recognize any compensation expense 
we have adopted the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment of fasb statement no 
refer to note of our consolidated financial statements for the disclosure information required under sfas no 
restricted stock or restricted stock units may be granted to certain eligible employees in accordance with applicable equity compensation plan documents and agreements 
subject to participants continued employment and other plan terms and conditions  the restrictions lapse and units vest ratably over three years 
upon vesting  the units are converted into shares of our common stock and are free of any restrictions 
in december  the compensation committee of the board of directors announced its intention to issue restricted stock and restricted stock units in lieu of stock options for stock based employee compensation to all employees commencing with grants in the first quarter of accordingly  under apb opinion no 
these awards to employees are required to be expensed over the vesting period 
non cash compensation expense associated with restricted stock awards was in and is estimated to be approximately in assuming the same level of restricted stock and restricted stock unit grants in and at the same stock price  we would record an incremental non cash compensation expense of approximately in each year  or a total non cash compensation expense of approximately and in and  respectively  as these grants vest over a three year period 
litigation and environmental matters numerous claims  complaints and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business  including but not limited to those relating to environmental matters  competitive issues  contract issues  intellectual property matters  personal injury and product liability claims  and workers compensation have been filed or are pending against us and certain of our subsidiaries 
additionally  we may become subject to significant claims of which we are unaware currently or the claims of which we are aware may result in our incurring a significantly greater liability than we anticipate 
this may also be true in connection with past or future acquisitions 
while we maintain property  cargo  auto  product  general liability  and directors and officers liability insurance and have acquired rights under similar policies in connection with our acquisitions that we believe cover a portion of these claims  this insurance may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against potential loss exposures 
in addition  we have been increasing our self insurance limits over the past several years 
while we believe we are entitled to indemnification from third parties for some of these claims  these rights may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against potential loss exposures 
in our opinion  these matters are either without merit or are of a kind that should not have a material adverse effect individually or in the aggregate on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
however  we cannot assure you that recoveries from insurance or indemnification claims will be available or that any of these claims or other matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
it is our policy to comply fully with applicable environmental requirements 
we are currently involved in various investigatory and remedial actions at our facilities and at third party waste disposal sites 
we accrue an estimate of loss  including expenses  from legal actions or claims when events exist that make the loss or expenses probable and we can reasonably estimate them 
our environmental accruals cover anticipated costs  including investigation  remediation  and operation and maintenance of clean up sites 
our estimates are based primarily on investigations and remediation plans established by independent consultants  potentially responsible third parties  and regulatory agencies at third party offsite disposal locations 
accordingly  our estimates may change based on future developments  including new or changes in existing environmental laws or policies  a difference in costs required to complete anticipated actions from estimates provided  future findings of investigation or remediation actions  or alteration to the expected remediation plans 
it is our policy to realize a change in estimates once it becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated 
in determining our accruals  we do not discount environmental or other legal accruals and do not reduce them by anticipated insurance recoveries 
we do take into account third party indemnification from financially viable parties in determining our accruals where there is no dispute regarding the right to indemnification 
while we believe that our accruals related to environmental  litigation and other claims are sufficient and that these items and our rights to available insurance and indemnity will be resolved without material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and liquidity  individually or in the aggregate  we cannot assure you that will be the case 
financial instruments we use interest rate swaps to manage our exposures to fluctuating interest rate risk on our variable rate debt portfolio 
we use interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges to reduce the risk of fluctuating interest rates by fixing a known cash flow that will be expended at future dates for the payment of interest 
we do not enter into financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
we report derivative financial instruments in our consolidated financial statements at fair value 
we record changes in the fair value of derivatives each period in earnings or other comprehensive income  depending on whether the derivative is designated and effective as part of a hedged transaction and on the type of hedge transaction 
we reclassify gains or losses on derivative instruments reported in other comprehensive income to earnings in the period in which earnings are affected by the underlying hedged item  and we recognize the ineffective portion of hedges in earnings in the current period 
this can result in additional volatility in reported earnings  other comprehensive income and accumulated other comprehensive income 
on the date a derivative contract is entered into  a qualifying derivative is designated as either a hedge of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment a fair value hedge  a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability a cash flow hedge  or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation a net investment hedge 
we document our hedge relationships  including identification of the hedging instruments and the hedged items  as well as our risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking the hedge transaction 
we record the fair values of derivative financial instruments in our balance sheets in other assets or other liabilities 
we also assess  both at inception and quarterly thereafter  whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the hedged item 
we record the effective portion of the changes in the fair value of our interest rate swaps  which are designated as cash flow hedges  in accumulated other comprehensive income  net of tax 
ineffectiveness is recorded as a component of interest expense 
changes in fair value are assessed quarterly based on dealer quotes 
income taxes we record our annual income taxes based on the requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which includes an estimate of the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
we periodically assess the realizability of deferred tax assets and the adequacy of deferred tax liabilities  including the results of local  state  federal or foreign statutory tax audits or estimates and judgments used 
realization of deferred tax assets associated with net operating loss and credit carryforwards is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income prior to their expiration 
we believe there is a risk that certain of these net operating loss and credit carryforwards may expire unused and  accordingly  have established a valuation allowance against them 
although realization is not assured for the remaining deferred tax assets  we believe it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be realized through future taxable earnings or alternative tax strategies 
however  deferred tax assets could be reduced in the near term if our estimates of taxable income during the carryforward period are significantly reduced or alternative tax strategies are no longer viable 
the valuation allowance decreased by in and increased by in the amount of income tax that we pay annually is dependent on various factors  including the timing of certain deductions 
since these deductions can vary from year to year  the amount of income taxes paid in future years may be greater than amounts paid in  and undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries amounted to approximately at december  a deferred tax estimate of has been provided for the foreign earnings of certain subsidiaries 
with the exception of these subsidiaries  the remaining foreign earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested 
accordingly  we have made no provision for us federal and state income taxes or foreign withholding taxes 
if these earnings were distributed  we would be subject to us income taxes subject to a reduction for foreign tax credits and withholding taxes payable to the various foreign countries 
determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred us income tax liability is not practicable  however  unrecognized foreign tax credits would be available to reduce some portion of the us liability 
us withholding taxes of approximately would be payable upon remittance of all previously unremitted earnings as of december  acquisitions we account for all business acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting and  accordingly  our statements of consolidated income include the results of each acquired business since the date of acquisition 
we record the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at estimates of fair value  as determined by management based on information available 
management considers a number of factors  including third party valuations or appraisals  when making these determinations 
we finalize the allocation of purchase price to the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed when we obtain information sufficient to complete the allocation  but in any case  within one year after acquisition 
as a result of acquisitions  we incur integration expenses for the incremental costs to exit and consolidate activities at the acquired companies locations  to terminate employees  and other costs of integrating operating locations and other activities of the acquired companies with our operations 
united states generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  requires us to reflect these acquisition integration expenses  to the extent that they are not associated with the generation of future revenues and have no future economic benefit  as assumed liabilities in the allocation of the purchase price to the net assets acquired 
on the other hand  these same principles require us to record acquisition integration expenses associated with integrating our existing operations into acquired company locations as period expenses 
these expenses are recorded as special charges and are discussed earlier in this section 
acquisition integration liabilities are based on our integration plans  which generally focus on three key areas of integration manufacturing process and supply chain rationalization  including plant closings  elimination of redundant administrative overhead and support activities  and restructuring and repositioning sales and marketing organizations to eliminate redundancies 
we expect that the termination of employees and consolidation of facilities will be substantially complete within one year of the date of acquisition 
use of estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we evaluate these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and base our estimates on experience  current and expected future conditions 
we also consider information from third party evaluations with respect to certain assumptions used in establishing our estimates 
the results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities as well as identifying and assessing the accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies 
actual results may differ from the estimates and assumptions used in our consolidated financial statements and related notes 
listed below are the significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our financial statements 
certain other estimates and assumptions are further explained elsewhere in this section or in our notes to consolidated financial statements 
the following should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes 
allowance for doubtful accounts we estimate losses for uncollectable accounts based on the aging of our accounts receivable and our evaluation of the likelihood of success in collecting the receivable 
impairment of long lived assets and intangibles subject to amortization we continually review whether events and circumstances subsequent to the acquisition of any long lived assets  or intangible assets subject to amortization  have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful lives of those assets may warrant revision or that the remaining balance of those assets may not be recoverable 
if events and circumstances indicate that the long lived assets should be reviewed for possible impairment  we use projections to assess whether future cash flows on a non discounted basis related to the tested assets are likely to exceed the recorded carrying amount of those assets to determine if a write down is appropriate 
should impairment be identified  a loss is reported to the extent that the carrying value of the impaired assets exceeds their fair values as determined by valuation techniques appropriate in the circumstances that could include the use of similar cash flow projections on a discounted basis 
in determining the estimated useful lives of definite lived intangibles  we consider the nature  competitive position  life cycle position and historical and expected future operating cash flows of each acquired asset  as well as our commitment to support these assets through continued investment and legal infringement protection 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets we test goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually to determine whether the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets exceeds their implied fair value 
consistent with the requirements of sfas no 
 the fair values of our reporting units were based on discounted cash flow projections that are believed to be reasonable under current and forecasted circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of the reported net assets of our reporting units 
other considerations are also incorporated  including comparable industry price multiples 
based on the results of the impairment testing performed  no impairment of goodwill or indefinite lived intangibles existed as of december  many of our businesses closely follow changes in the industries and end markets that they serve 
accordingly  we consider estimates and judgments that affect the future cash flow projections including principal methods of competition such as volume  price  service  product performance and technical innovations as well as estimates associated with cost improvement initiatives  capacity utilization  and assumptions for inflation and foreign currency changes 
accordingly  we monitor impairment indicators across our industries and markets including  but not limited to  the power transmission  industrial tools  broadcast  telecommunications and warehouse construction markets 
any significant change in market conditions and estimates or judgments used to determine expected future cash flows that indicates a reduction in carrying value may give rise to impairment in the period that the change becomes known 
accrued liabilities we make estimates and judgments in establishing accruals as required under gaap  including the following legal it is our policy to accrue for estimated losses from legal actions or claims  including legal expenses  when events exist that make the realization of the losses or expenses probable and they can be reasonably estimated 
environmental remediation costs we expense costs incurred to investigate and remediate environmental issues unless they extend the economic useful life of related assets 
we record liabilities and report expenses when it is probable that an obligation has been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated 
our environmental accruals cover anticipated costs  including investigation  remediation  and operation and maintenance of clean up sites 
our estimates are based primarily on investigations and remediation plans established by independent consultants  regulatory agencies and potentially responsible third parties 
we do not discount environmental obligations or reduce them by anticipated insurance recoveries 
self insurance we are primarily self insured for workers compensation  automobile  product and general liability costs  and we believe that we maintain adequate accruals to cover our retained liability 
our accrual for self insurance liability is determined by management and is based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported 
management considers a number of factors  including third party actuarial valuations  when making these determinations 
we maintain third party stop loss insurance policies to cover liability costs in excess of predetermined amounts 
warranty in the normal course of business we issue product warranties for specific product lines and provide for the estimated future warranty cost in the period in which the sale is recorded 
we provide for the estimate of warranty cost based on contract terms and historical warranty loss experience 
because warranty estimates are forecasts that are based on the best available information  claims costs may differ from amounts provided 
in addition  due to the seasonal fluctuations at certain of our businesses  the timing of warranty provisions and the usage of warranty accruals can vary period to period 
we make adjustments to initial obligations for warranties as changes in the obligations become reasonably estimable

liquidity and financial condition listed below are the cash flows from used in operating  investing and financing activities and the net change in cash and cash equivalents for the twelve months ended  and cash flow from operating activities cash flow used in investing activities cash flow from used in financing activities cash flows from used in discontinued operations net increase in cash and equivalents compared to operating activities we had cash flow from operations of in the primary factors contributing to the increase in operating cash flow in as compared to were a year over year improvement in net working capital and lower cash spending for restructuring actions 
in  working capital provided of cash inflows compared to outflows of in of the year over year improvement in accounts receivable and other  approximately was related to the non recourse sale of certain trade receivables 
these receivables were sold pursuant to an agreement that allows for similar receivable sales in the future  and we expect to continue selling comparable amounts of receivables in connection with this agreement 
in addition  cash spending on restructuring actions was lower in  which was driven primarily by restructuring activity and related special charges at levels below those in we expect to take additional special charges in in connection with implementing further cost reduction outsourcing actions and business consolidations 
while we cannot fully quantify the amount of these charges  the related cash portion has averaged approximately two thirds of the special charge recorded in the income statement 
in addition  the timing of the cash flows does not necessarily match the period in which a special charge is taken 
we paid  and in cash taxes for  and respectively 
in we made payments of associated with the actual and estimated tax liability for federal  state and foreign tax obligations and received refunds of the amount of income tax that we pay annually is dependent on various factors  including the timing of certain deductions 
since these deductions can vary from year to year  the amount of income taxes paid in future years may be greater than amounts paid in  and cash flows from continuing operations included and  in and  respectively  related to favorable patent litigation settlements 
accrued costs of related to the microsoft settlement will be paid in the first quarter of investing activities the major factor in the reduction in cash flows used in investing activities was the realization of an additional increase in proceeds from asset sales  which included principally the sale of inrange and our interest in the assa abloy door joint venture 
continually focusing on projects that generate cash from under utilized plant and equipment and non core product lines is a basic principle of our value improvement process 
the reduction in capital expenditures was primarily the result of higher spending in related to the construction of a new manufacturing facility for our lab and life sciences platform 
we estimate that capital expenditures will be similar to the investments made during cash spending on acquisitions was up slightly as we completed fourteen acquisitions in compared to thirteen in  and our average acquisition price over the two year period was approximately financing activities cash used in financing activities increased in contributing to this increase was a net repayment of borrowings due primarily to the early repayment of owed under our credit facility  the retirement of of liquid yield option notes lyons  and the issuance of in principal amounts of senior notes 
scheduled repayments of long term debt instruments are expected to be in increases in borrowings under other financing agreements consisted primarily of higher usage of our purchasing card program as our businesses take advantage of flexible low cost financing alternatives 
in addition to incremental debt repayments  repurchases of our common stock were higher in  as we purchased shares for an average price of per share in whereas we purchased shares in for an average price of per share 
cash received from stock option and stock warrant exercises was higher in all outstanding stock warrants were exercised in  and the variability in cash received from stock option exercises is correlated to the market price of our common stock 
in december  we announced the implementation of a quarterly dividend program 
the actual amount of each quarterly dividend  as well as each declaration date  record date and payment date  is subject to the discretion of the board  and the target dividend level may be adjusted during the year at the discretion of the board 
pursuant to the program  on february  our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of per common share  payable on april  to shareholders of record on march compared to operating activities in  cash flows from operating activities were compared to cash flows from operating activities of in the decrease in operating cash flow was due primarily to of cash spending on restructuring activities compared to in and a net increase in working capital outflows 
the increase in restructuring spending as compared to was due primarily to the completion of udi integration actions and previously initiated restructuring actions 
the primary driver of the working capital outflows in was the timing of certain payments  which were partially offset with working capital improvements  measured as a percent of revenue  at our service solutions segment  our flow technology segment and our compaction equipment business  as well as net cash received from a patent infringement award 
investing activities cash flows used in investing activities were higher in than in as cash spending on acquisitions and capital expenditures was higher in cash used for business acquisitions was  or  greater in as compared to in  acquisition spending included cash used for the udi acquisition and used for the acquisition of kendro  our largest bolt on acquisition in history in terms of purchase price 
excluding the cash spent in for kendro and udi  cash used for acquisitions increased  or  as compared to  as we completed thirteen bolt on acquisitions in cash used for capital expenditures was in compared to in the decrease in capital expenditures was due primarily to the fact that results included incremental spending on various plant expansion projects and new capital deployed at the recently acquired udi businesses 
cash proceeds from asset sales were higher in  driven by the received in from the sale of our door products business into a joint venture with assa abloy whereby we also received a ownership in the joint venture 
proceeds from asset sales in primarily included the divestiture of a non strategic machinery and material handling product line  as well as sales of non core plant and equipment 
aside from the assa abloy joint venture transaction  cash proceeds from asset sales in were generated primarily by the disposition of other product lines acquired with udi 
financing activities in  cash used in financing activities was compared to cash from financing activities of in net borrowings were in compared to in in  we amended and restated our senior credit facility  which resulted in a net reduction of our variable rate debt portfolio  and we paid down of other indebtedness 
these payments were offset by the issuance of in senior notes in december net borrowings in were higher than due primarily to the february issuance of lyons and the refinancing of debt acquired from udi 
in  we had of borrowings under other financing agreements  which primarily consist of usage of our purchasing card program 
due to recent accounting guidance regarding purchasing card arrangements  amounts owed are considered short term debt rather than accounts payable and have been classified accordingly 
in  we repurchased shares of our common stock for in cash 
we did not repurchase any common stock in in  we received from the exercise of stock warrants 
this was offset by of cash paid for other financing activities  including the termination of four interest rate swaps 
our management believes that free cash flow  which is defined as cash flows from operating activities less capital expenditures  can be a useful financial measure for investors in evaluating the cash flow performance of multi industrial companies  since it provides insight into the amount of cash available to fund such things as debt reduction and acquisitions or other strategic investments 
in addition  free cash flow is one of the factors used by our management in internal evaluations of the overall performance of our business 
free cash flow  however  is not a measure of financial performance under gaap  should not be considered a substitute for cash flows from operating activities as determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of liquidity  and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
in addition  free cash flow is not a direct measure of cash flow available for discretionary spending  since non discretionary expenditures  such as debt service  are not deducted from free cash flow 
cash flows from continuing operating activities of   in  and  respectively  less capital expenditures of  and  respectively  resulted in free cash flow in  and of  and  respectively 
debt the following summarizes the debt outstanding and unused credit availability  as of december  total commitment amount outstanding unused credit availability revolving credit loan tranche a term loan tranche b term loan lyons  net of unamortized discount of senior notes senior notes other borrowings total the unused credit availability is reduced by of letters of credit outstanding as of december  includes short term debt and current maturities of long term debt of as of december  credit facility our credit facility includes our tranche a and tranche b term loans along with our revolving credit loan 
aggregate maturities of the term loans are in  in  in  in  in  and in although no amounts are borrowed under our revolving credit loans at december   any future borrowings under these loans would mature in  when the facility expires  but could be repaid at any time before in august  we refinanced our credit facility by combining the existing tranche c term loan into the tranche b term loan 
the purpose of this refinancing was to reduce the applicable rate on the tranche c borrowings and to amend certain covenants to  among other things  increase flexibility with respect to dividend payment and stock repurchases 
on december   we repaid of our outstanding tranche b term loan in advance of its maturity date 
on february   we refinanced our credit facility to reduce the applicable rate on our tranche b term loan 
we also amended certain covenants to  among other things  increase our flexibility associated with the mandatory repayment of debt and disposition of assets 
the tranche b term loan matures in september in addition  our credit facility provides for a commitment to provide revolving credit loans of up to as of december   the revolving credit loans were unused  however  the aggregate available borrowing capacity was reduced by of letters of credit outstanding as of december  under the credit facility  the term loans bear interest  at our option  at libor plus the applicable rate or the abr plus the applicable rate 
during  interest on the term loans was calculated using libor and we intend to select libor as the borrowing rate in the foreseeable future 
the applicable rate for the revolving loans and the tranche a and b term loans is based upon the consolidated leverage ratio as defined in the credit facility 
the applicable rate in effect after the february refinancing is as follows libor based borrowings abr based borrowings tranche a term loan and revolving loans between and between and tranche b term loan between and between and our of revolving loans available under our credit facility is also subject to annual commitment fees between and on the unused portion of the loans 
our credit facility is secured by a pledge of of the stock of substantially all of our domestic subsidiaries and of the stock in our foreign subsidiaries and a security interest in substantially all of our assets and all of the assets of our wholly owned domestic subsidiaries 
our credit facility contains covenants  the most restrictive of which are two financial condition covenants 
the first financial condition covenant does not permit the consolidated leverage ratio as defined in the credit facility as of the last day of any period of four consecutive quarters to exceed to 
the second financial condition covenant does not permit the consolidated interest coverage ratio as defined in the credit facility for any period of four consecutive quarters to be less than to 
for the year ending december   our consolidated leverage ratio was to and our consolidated interest coverage ratio was to 
our credit facility also includes covenant provisions regarding  among other things  indebtedness  liens  investments  guarantees  acquisitions  dispositions  sales and leaseback transactions  restricted payments  and transactions with affiliates 
based on available information  we do not expect these covenants to restrict our liquidity  financial condition or access to capital resources in the foreseeable future 
under the credit facility covenants  our ability to pay cash dividends in a fiscal year is limited to plus an amount equal to of our consolidated net income as defined in the credit facility for the immediate preceding fiscal year minus stock repurchases in excess of if our consolidated leverage ratio is between and in addition  our credit facility contains the following covenants regarding our ability to repurchase shares of our common stock if our consolidated leverage ratio as defined in the credit facility is greater than  our share repurchase capacity is limited to  if our consolidated leverage ratio is between and  our share repurchase capacity is limited to plus an amount equal to of consolidated net income from october  to the end of the most recent fiscal period  less any cash dividends paid in excess of  and if our consolidated leverage ratio is less than  our share repurchase capacity is unlimited 
we have not paid cash dividends in or  however  our board of directors has approved the implementation of a quarterly dividend program 
pursuant to the program  on february  our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of per common share  payable on april  to shareholders of record on march  see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion on our dividend program 
we are permitted to prepay the tranche a and tranche b term loans in whole or in part at any time without penalty or premium 
we are not allowed to re borrow any amounts that we repay on the tranche a or tranche b term loans 
the final maturity for each loan is as follows date of final maturity revolving loans march  tranche a term loans march  tranche b term loans september  our credit facility also requires scheduled principal payments of the term loans and mandatory prepayments from net proceeds arising in connection with certain asset sales or dispositions and issuances of subordinated debt under certain circumstances 
the revolving loans may be borrowed  prepaid and re borrowed 
letters of credit and swing line loans are also available under the revolving credit facility 
the facility provides for the issuance of letters of credit in us dollars  euros  and pounds sterling at any time during the revolving availability period  in an aggregate amount not exceeding letters of credit issued under this facility reduce the aggregate amount available under the revolving loan commitment 
senior notes in june  we issued of non callable senior notes that mature on june  in december  we issued of callable senior notes that mature on january  both of these note issuances are unsecured and rank equally with all of our existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness  but are effectively junior to our senior secured debt and obligations of our subsidiaries 
the indentures governing the notes contain a number of covenants that limit our ability  and the ability of our subsidiaries  to incur additional debt  pay dividends and repurchase stock  make other restricted payments  including  without limitation  investments  create liens  enter into sale leaseback transactions  enter into agreements that restrict dividends from subsidiaries  sell or otherwise dispose of assets  including capital stock of subsidiaries  enter into transactions with our affiliates  and enter into mergers or consolidations 
under the indentures  none of our subsidiaries are restricted from paying dividends to us 
liquid yield option notes on february   we issued liquid yield option tm notes february lyons at an original price of per  principal amount at maturity  which represents an aggregate initial issue price including the over allotment exercised by the original purchaser of and an aggregate principal amount of due at maturity on february  on may   we issued liquid yield option tm notes may lyons at an original price of per  principal amount at maturity  which represents an aggregate initial issue price including the over allotment exercised by the original purchaser of and an aggregate principal amount of due at maturity on may  we may redeem all or a portion of the february lyons for cash at any time on or after february  at predetermined redemption prices 
february lyons holders may require us to purchase all or a portion of their lyons on february  for per lyon  or february  for per lyon 
we may redeem all or a portion of the may lyons for cash at any time on or after may  may lyons holders may require us to purchase all or a portion of their lyons on may  for per lyon or may  for per lyon 
for either the february lyons or may lyons  we have the option to pay the purchase price in cash  shares of common stock or a combination of cash and common stock 
on may   of the may lyons were put to us and settled in cash for  their accreted value as of may  the may lyons that remain outstanding subsequent to the put have an accreted value of at december  and are classified as long term debt as the next put date is may  as a result of the put on may   we were subject to of tax recapture on the may lyons  which was paid in the third quarter of on february   an immaterial amount of the february lyons were put to us and settled in cash 
the february lyons that remain outstanding subsequent to the put have an accreted value of at december  the next put date for the february lyons is february  and therefore of the february lyons outstanding at december  are classified as long term debt 
the lyons have a yield to maturity of per year  computed on a semi annual bond equivalent basis  calculated from the date of issuance 
we will not pay cash interest on the lyons prior to maturity unless contingent interest becomes payable 
the lyons are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations and are debt instruments subject to united states federal income tax contingent payment debt regulations 
even if we do not pay any cash interest on the lyons  bondholders are required to include interest in their gross income for united states federal income tax purposes 
this imputed interest  also referred to as tax original issue discount  accrues at a rate equal to on the february lyons and on the may lyons 
the rate at which the tax original issue discount accrues for united states federal income tax purposes exceeds the stated yield of for the accrued original issue discount 
in the event that any of the february lyons or may lyons are put to the company or redeemed by the company  the respective imputed interest deduction less the original issue discount of would be recaptured at the time of the put or redemption 
the amount of tax recapture we may be subject to at the next put dates of may  and february   if the lyons are put to us  is and  respectively 
the lyons are subject to conversion to shares of our common stock only if certain contingencies are met 
these contingencies include our average stock price exceeding predetermined accreted values of our stock price each quarter see below  during any period in which the credit rating assigned to the lyons by either moody s or standard poor s is at or below a specified level  and upon the occurrence of certain corporate transactions  including a change in control 
in addition  a holder may surrender for conversion  at the accreted value  a lyon for redemption even if it is not otherwise convertible at such time 
the conversion rights based on predetermined accretive values of our stock include  but are not limited to  the following provisions february lyons may lyons initial conversion rate shares of common stock per lyon initial accretion percentage accretion percentage decline per quarter conversion trigger prices for the next twelve months first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter holders may surrender lyons for conversion into shares of common stock in any calendar quarter  if  as of the last day of the preceding calendar quarter  the closing sale price of our common stock for at least trading days in a period of consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of such preceding calendar quarter is more than the specified percentage beginning at and declining per quarter thereafter for the february lyons  beginning at and declining per quarter thereafter for the may lyons of the accreted conversion price per share of common stock on the last trading day of such preceding calendar quarter 
the accreted conversion price per share as of any day will equal the issue price of a lyon plus the accrued original issue discount to that day  divided by the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of a lyon on that day 
under gaap  the lyons are not included in the diluted income per share of common stock calculation unless a lyon is expected to be converted for stock or one of the three contingent conversion tests summarized above are met 
if the lyons were to be put  we expect to settle them for cash and none of the contingent conversion tests have been met  accordingly  they are not included in the diluted income per share of common stock calculation 
if converted as of december   the february lyons and may lyons would be exchanged for a total of million shares of our common stock 
if the lyons had been converted as of january   diluted income per share of common stock from continuing operations would have been for the year ended december  other borrowings certain of our businesses participate in extended accounts payable programs through agreements with certain lending institutions 
under the arrangements  the businesses are provided extended payment terms 
as of december   the participating businesses had outstanding under these arrangements 
additionally  certain of our businesses purchase goods and services under a purchasing card program allowing payment beyond their normal payment terms 
as of december   the participating businesses had outstanding under this arrangement 
as these arrangements extend the payment of our businesses payables beyond their normal payment terms  we have classified these amounts as short term debt 
at december   a total of was outstanding under these programs 
other financing activities our compaction equipment business  part of the industrial products and services segment  utilizes an accounts receivable securitization facility pursuant to which it has an agreement to sell  on a revolving basis without recourse  certain qualified receivables  of which and had been sold under the agreement at december  and december   respectively 
the agreement allows for the sale of up to of certain qualified receivables to an unaffiliated third party entity and continues on an evergreen revolving basis unless we provide a three month notice under the agreement to discontinue the facility 
we expect to utilize the agreement in the foreseeable future 
in the fourth quarter of  we also entered into a sale and assignment agreement whereby certain of our businesses agreed to sell without recourse in receivables 
the net proceeds from the sale of the receivables were at december  we expect to utilize similar agreements in the foreseeable future  however  in the event we were to no longer utilize these programs  the impact on our financial condition or cash flows may be material 
in april  we entered into a three year trade receivables financing agreement whereby we can borrow  on a continuous basis  up to as of december   we had not yet utilized this program 
financial instruments we have entered into interest rate protection agreements swaps to hedge the potential impact of increases in interest rates on our variable rate debt portfolio 
we account for our swaps as cash flow hedges  and as of december   we had outstanding swaps with maturities to november that effectively convert  of our variable rate debt to a fixed rate of approximately 
as of december   the pre tax accumulated derivative loss recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss was  and we have recorded a long term liability of to recognize the fair value of these swaps 
based on the unrealized losses of our swaps at december   we expect to reclassify of our current derivative loss from accumulated other comprehensive income into interest expense during as the hedged transactions occur 
due to fluctuations in interest rates  however  the derivative loss recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income is subject to change prior to its reclassification into earnings 
the ineffective portion of these swaps has been recognized in earnings as a component of interest and resulted in expense of in we do not enter into financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
in  in connection with the repayment of of our outstanding tranche b term loan  we terminated one interest rate swap with an aggregate notional amount of for cash of this interest rate swap was included in the portfolio of interest rate swaps designated as a cash flow hedge of our variable rate debt portfolio 
because a portion of the future interest payments hedged by this swap was no longer probable of occurring  we recognized in interest expense to reclassify into earnings from accumulated other comprehensive loss  the fair value of the portion of the swap portfolio that was no longer probable of occurring 
from time to time we enter into commodity contracts or currency hedges 
other than the above noted swap arrangements  there were no material derivative instrument transactions during any of the periods presented 
current liquidity and principal payments we use operating leases to finance certain asset purchases when economically supported by our internal evaluation model 
these leases are used primarily to fund capital equipment programs to match payment terms with the expected production use of the equipment  although the expected useful or economic life of the asset is greater 
at december   we had of future minimum rental payments under leases with remaining non cancelable terms in excess of one year 
at december   we had of cash available for use and an unused revolver under our credit facility 
when adjusted by the of letters of credit outstanding at december   of the revolver was available for immediate use 
we believe that current cash and equivalents  cash flows from operations and our unused revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund working capital needs  planned capital expenditures  other operational cash requirements  and required debt service obligations in the foreseeable future 
in addition  we believe we have the ability and may elect to refinance the lyons  if put  with other debt 
we have a shelf registration statement for shares of common stock that may be issued for acquisitions 
we also have a  shelf registration that may be used in connection with an offering of certain debt and or equity securities for general corporate purposes or for the refinancing of existing debt 
in addition  other financing instruments may be used from time to time  including  but not limited to  private placement instruments  operating leases  capital leases and securitizations 
we expect that we will continue to access these markets as appropriate to maintain liquidity and to provide sources of funds for general corporate purposes or to refinance existing debt 
in april  we entered into an agreement to securitize and sell  on a continuous basis  up to of accounts receivable 
as of december   we had not yet utilized this program 
we were in compliance with all covenants included in our capital financing instruments as of december  and on february   the date of the most recent refinancing of our credit facility 
we have not paid cash dividends in  or  however  our board of directors has approved the implementation of a quarterly dividend program 
the actual amount of each quarterly dividend  as well as each declaration date  record date and payment date is subject to the discretion of the board of directors  and the target dividend level may be adjusted during the year at the discretion of the board of directors 
the factors the board of directors is expected to consider in determining the actual amount of each quarterly dividend include our financial performance and on going capital needs  our ability to declare and pay dividends under the terms of our credit facility and indenture  and other factors deemed relevant 
pursuant to the program  on february  our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of per common share  payable on april  to shareholders of record on march  financial instruments that potentially subject us to significant concentrations of credit risk consist of cash and temporary investments  trade accounts receivable and interest rate protection agreements 
cash and temporary investments and our interest rate protection agreements are placed with high quality financial institutions throughout the world 
we periodically evaluate the credit standing of these financial institutions 
concentrations of credit risk arising from trade accounts receivable are due to selling to a large number of customers in a particular industry 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial conditions and obtain collateral or other security when appropriate 
no one customer accounts for more than of our revenues 
we are exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by counter parties to our interest rate protection agreements  but have no other off balance sheet credit risk of accounting loss 
we anticipate  however  that counter parties will be able to fully satisfy their obligations under the contracts 
we do not obtain collateral or other security to support financial instruments subject to credit risk  but we do monitor the credit standing of counter parties 
we paid  and in cash taxes for  and  respectively 
in  we made payments of associated with the actual and estimated tax liability for federal  state and foreign tax obligations and received refunds of the amount of income tax that we pay annually is dependent on various factors  including the timing of certain deductions 
since these deductions can vary from year to year  the amount of income taxes paid in future years may be greater than amounts paid in  and as of december   except as discussed in notes and to the consolidated financial statements and for the following items  we do not have any material guarantees  off balance sheet arrangements or purchase commitments other than of certain standby letters of credit outstanding  of which reduce the available borrowing capacity on our revolving loans  and approximately of surety bonds 
of the total letters of credit and surety bonds outstanding at december   were for bid  performance or warranty arrangements related to commercial sales arrangements with customers of which the fees are reimbursed by the customer 
in addition  of our standby letters of credit relate to self insurance matters and originate from workers compensation  auto  or general liability claims made against us 
we account for each of these claims as part of our self insurance accruals 
except for the previously mentioned matters  we do not have any other material guarantees  off balance sheet arrangements or purchase commitments 
our certificate of incorporation provides that we shall indemnify our officers and directors to the fullest extent permitted by the delaware general corporation law for any personal liability in connection with their employment or service with us  subject to limited exceptions 
while we maintain insurance for this type of liability  the liability could exceed the amount of the insurance coverage 
we continually review each of our businesses pursuant to our grow  fix or sell strategy 
these reviews could result in selected acquisitions to expand an existing business or result in the disposition of an existing business 
additionally  we have stated that we would consider a larger acquisition  more than  in revenues  if certain criteria were met 
there can be no assurances that these acquisitions will not have an impact on our capital financing requirements  will be integrated successfully  or that they may not have a negative effect on our operations 
in addition  you should read factors that may affect future results that follows  business segment information included in the md a and item

the following is a summary of our primary contractual obligations contractual obligations total due within year due within years due within years due after years short term debt long term debt purchase obligations future minimum lease payments total contractual cash obligations there are various factors that a lyon holder would use in deciding to exercise its put option 
these factors include the price and volatility of our common stock  the interest yield on the lyons above the risk free interest rate and other quantitative and qualitative factors 
based upon the terms of the february and may lyons  holders may require us to purchase their lyons on february  and may   respectively 
if all the remaining february lyons were settled in cash on february   we would be required to pay the holders approximately if all the remaining may lyons were settled in cash on may   we would be required to pay the holders approximately due to the uncertainty surrounding the actual exercise of these put options  the full accreted value of the outstanding february and may lyons has been presented above based on their original maturity dates of february  and may   respectively 
represents contractual legally binding commitments to purchase goods and services at specified dates 
represents rental payments under leases with remaining non cancelable terms in excess of one year 
our long term liabilities include both contractual and contingent obligations 
contractual obligations consist primarily of pension  other postretirement benefit  and financial instrument obligations 
contingent obligations  such as environmental accruals  generally have no specific payment dates 
we do not however  expect any material cash outlays for any of these matters in any of the next five years 
we do not expect to make any material cash contributions to our primary domestic pension plans in the near future 
in  we made direct benefit payments of pursuant to our postretirement benefit plan and other non funded pension plan obligations  and we expect to make a similar level of contributions to these plans in see note to the consolidated financial statements for further disclosure of expected future benefit payments

factors that may affect future results our indebtedness may affect our business and may restrict our operating flexibility 
at december   we had approximately  in total indebtedness 
on that same date  we had of available borrowing capacity under our revolving senior credit facility after giving effect to reserved for letters of credit outstanding  which reduce the availability under our revolving senior credit facility 
in addition  at december   our cash balance was see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a and note to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
subject to certain restrictions set forth in our senior credit facility and the indenture governing our senior notes  we may incur additional indebtedness in the future  including indebtedness incurred to finance  or which is assumed in connection with  acquisitions 
we may in the future renegotiate or refinance our senior credit facility with agreements that have different or more stringent terms or split our senior credit facility into two or more facilities with different terms 
the level of our indebtedness could limit cash flow available for general corporate purposes  such as acquisitions and capital expenditures  due to the ongoing cash flow requirements for debt service  limit our ability to obtain  or obtain on favorable terms  additional debt financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures or acquisitions  limit our flexibility in reacting to competitive and other changes in the industry and economic conditions generally  expose us to a risk that a substantial decrease in net operating cash flows due to economic developments or adverse developments in our business could make it difficult to meet debt service requirements  and expose us to risks inherent in interest rate fluctuations because the existing borrowings are  and any new borrowings may be at variable rates of interest  which could result in higher interest expense in the event of increases in interest rates 
our ability to make scheduled payments of principal  to pay interest on  or to refinance our indebtedness and to satisfy our other debt obligations  including our obligations to repurchase the liquid yield option notes lyons if the holders of the lyons require us to repurchase their securities beginning in february for the february lyons will depend upon our future operating performance  which may be affected by general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory  business and other factors beyond our control 
we will not be able to control many of these factors  such as the economic conditions in the markets in which we operate and initiatives taken by our competitors 
in addition  there can be no assurance that future borrowings or equity financing will be available for the payment or refinancing of our indebtedness 
if we are unable to service our indebtedness  whether in the ordinary course of business or upon acceleration of such indebtedness  we may be forced to pursue one or more alternative strategies  such as restructuring or refinancing our indebtedness  selling assets  reducing or delaying capital expenditures  revising implementation of or delaying strategic plans or seeking additional equity capital 
if we are required to take any of these actions  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  we cannot assure you that we would be able to take any of these actions  that these actions would enable us continue to satisfy our capital requirements or that these actions would be permitted under the terms of our various debt agreements 
we may not be able to finance future needs or adapt our business plan to changes in economic or business conditions because of restrictions placed on us by our senior credit facility  the indenture governing our senior notes and any existing or future instruments governing our other indebtedness 
our senior credit facility  the indentures governing our senior notes and other agreements governing our other indebtedness contain  or may contain  a number of significant restrictions and covenants that limit our ability to make distributions or other payments to our investors and creditors unless certain financial tests or other criteria are satisfied 
we also must comply with certain specified financial ratios and tests 
in some cases  our subsidiaries may be subject to similar restrictions that may restrict their ability to make distributions to us 
in addition  our senior credit facility  the indentures governing our senior notes and these other agreements contain or may contain additional affirmative and negative covenants as described under md a 
all of these restrictions could affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities  such as acquisitions  as they arise 
if we do not comply with these or other covenants and restrictions contained in our senior credit facility  the indentures governing our senior notes and other agreements governing our indebtedness  we could be in default under those agreements  and the debt  together with accrued interest  could then be declared immediately due and payable 
if we default under our senior credit facility  the lenders could cause all of our outstanding debt obligations under our senior credit facility to become due and payable  require us to apply all of our cash to repay the indebtedness or prevent us from making debt service payments on any subordinated indebtedness we owe 
if our debt is accelerated  we may not be able to repay our debt or refinance it 
even if we are able to obtain new financing  we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it 
in addition  any default under our senior credit facility or agreements governing our other indebtedness could lead to an acceleration of debt under other debt instruments that contain cross acceleration or cross default provisions 
if the indebtedness under our senior credit facility and the indentures governing our senior notes is accelerated  we may not have sufficient assets to repay amounts due under our senior credit facility  our senior notes  or the lyons that we have issued  or under other debt securities then outstanding 
our ability to comply with these provisions of our senior credit facility  the indentures governing our senior notes and other agreements governing our other indebtedness may be affected by changes in the economic or business conditions or other events beyond our control 
in addition  complying with our covenants may also cause us to take actions that are not favorable to us and may make it more difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy and compete against companies that are not subject to such restrictions 
our failure to successfully integrate recent acquisitions  as well as any future acquisitions  could have a negative effect on our operations  our acquisitions could cause unexpected financial difficulties 
as part of our business strategy  we evaluate potential acquisitions in the ordinary course  some of which could be material 
we made fourteen acquisitions in for an aggregate purchase price of  net of cash acquired  which excludes consideration held back by us that may be paid in future periods 
our acquisitions involve a number of risks and present financial  managerial and operational challenges  including adverse effects on our reported operating results due to charges to earnings  including impairment charges associated with goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles  diversion of management attention from running our existing businesses  difficulty with integration of personnel and financial and other systems  increased expenses  including compensation expenses resulting from newly hired employees  increased foreign operations that may be difficult to assimilate  assumption of known and unknown liabilities and increased litigation  and potential disputes with the sellers of acquired businesses  technology  services or products 
we may not be able to integrate successfully the technology  operations and personnel of any acquired business 
our integration activities may place substantial demand on our management  operational resources and financial and internal control systems 
customer dissatisfaction or performance problems with an acquired business  technology  service or product could also have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business 
in addition  any acquired business  technology  service or product could under perform relative to our expectations 
we also could experience financial or other setbacks if any of the businesses that we have acquired or may acquire in the future have problems or liabilities of which we are not aware or that are substantially greater than we anticipate 
in addition  as a result of future acquisitions  we may further increase our debt level  or if we issue equity securities to pay for acquisitions  significantly dilute our existing shareholders 
we may not achieve the expected cost savings and other benefits of our acquisitions 
as a result of our acquisitions  we incur integration expenses for the incremental costs to exit and consolidate activities  to terminate employees  and for other costs to integrate operating locations and other activities of acquired companies with our operations 
significant portions of these expenses are cash expenses 
generally accepted accounting principles require that these acquisition integration expenses  which are not associated with the generation of future revenues and have no future economic benefit  be reflected as assumed liabilities in the allocation of the purchase price to the net assets acquired 
on the other hand  these same principles require that acquisition integration expenses associated with integrating our operations into locations of the acquired company must be recorded as expense 
accordingly  these expenses are not included in the allocation of the purchase price of the company acquired 
over the past five years  we have recorded special charges to our results of operations associated with cost reductions  integrating acquisitions and achieving operating efficiencies 
we believe that our actions have been required to improve our operations and  as described above  we will  if necessary  record future charges  which may be material  as appropriate to address cost and operational inefficiencies 
our plan is to achieve cost savings associated with integrating our acquisitions 
this plan is sometimes a consideration in the price we are willing to pay for acquisitions 
our current integration strategy for acquisitions focuses on three key areas of cost savings manufacturing process and supply chain rationalization  including plant closings  elimination of redundant administrative overhead and support activities  and restructuring and repositioning sales and marketing organizations to eliminate redundancies 
while we anticipate that we will achieve cost savings associated with integrating our acquisitions  cost savings expectations are inherently estimates that are difficult to predict and are necessarily speculative in nature 
in addition  we cannot assure you that unforeseen factors will not offset the estimated cost savings or other benefits from our acquisitions 
as a result  our actual cost savings  if any  and other anticipated benefits could significantly differ or be delayed  compared to our estimates and the other information contained in this report 
we may not be able to consummate acquisitions at our prior rate  which could negatively impact us 
we may not be able to consummate acquisitions at similar rates to our past acquisition rates  which could materially impact our growth rate  results of operations  cash flows and stock price 
our ability to continue to achieve our goals may depend upon our ability to identify and successfully acquire companies  businesses and product lines  to effectively integrate them and to achieve cost effectiveness 
we also may need to raise additional funds to consummate these acquisitions 
in addition  changes in our stock price may adversely affect our ability to consummate acquisitions 
competition for acquisitions in our business areas could also result in higher prices for these businesses  which may also impact our acquisition rate or the success rate of our acquisitions 
the loss of key personnel and any inability to attract and retain qualified employees could materially adversely impact our operations 
we are dependent on the continued services of our leadership team  including our chairman of the board  president and chief executive officer 
the loss of these personnel without adequate replacement could have a material adverse effect 
additionally  we need qualified managers and skilled employees with technical and manufacturing industry experience in order to operate our business successfully 
from time to time  there may be a shortage of skilled labor  which may make it more difficult and expensive for us to attract and retain qualified employees 
if we were unable to attract and retain qualified individuals or our costs to do so increase significantly  our operations would be materially adversely affected 
many of the industries in which we operate are cyclical  and  accordingly  our business is subject to changes in the economy  pressure from original equipment manufacturers to reduce costs could adversely affect our business 
many of the business areas in which we operate are subject to specific industry and general economic cycles 
certain businesses are subject to industry cycles  including  but not limited to the automotive industry  which influences our service solutions and industrial products and services segments  the electric power and infrastructure markets  which influence our industrial products and services and cooling technologies and services segments  process equipment  chemical and petrochemical markets  which influence our flow technology segment  the non residential facility construction markets  which influence our technical products and systems and industrial products and services segments  and the laboratory and life science markets  which influence our technical products and systems segment 
demand for products in our cooling technologies and services segment is highly correlated to contract timing on large construction contracts  which may cause significant fluctuations from period to period 
accordingly  any downturn or competitive pricing pressures in those or other markets in which we participate could adversely affect us 
difficulties at enron  dynegy  nrg and other independent power producers has led to a change in the buying habits of some customers in the power generation markets  which has led to lower demand and price levels for our power transformers 
a decline in automotive sales and production may not only affect our sales of components  tools and services to vehicle manufacturers and their dealerships  but also sales of components  tools and services to aftermarket customers  and could result in a decline in our results of operations or a deterioration in our financial condition 
similar cyclical changes could also affect aftermarket sales of products in our other segments 
there is also substantial and continuing pressure from the major original equipment manufacturers  particularly in the automotive industry  to reduce costs  including the cost of products and services purchased from outside suppliers such as us 
if in the future we were unable to generate sufficient cost savings to offset price reductions  our gross margins could be materially adversely affected 
if demand changes and we fail to respond accordingly  our results of operations could be materially adversely affected in any given quarter or period 
the downturns in the business cycles of our different operations may occur at the same time  which could exacerbate any material adverse effects to our business 
see md a business segment information 
in addition  certain of our businesses have seasonal fluctuations 
in aggregate  our businesses generally tend to be stronger in the second half of the year  particularly in the fourth quarter 
consistent with many multi industry  capital goods companies  certain of our businesses have been impacted in by soft economic conditions 
there can be no assurance that the economic downturn will not worsen or that we will be able to sustain existing or create additional cost reductions to offset economic conditions  and the unpredictability and changes in the industrial markets in the current environment could continue and may adversely impact our results 
cost reduction actions often result in charges against earnings 
we expect to take charges against earnings in in connection with implementing additional cost reduction actions at certain of our businesses 
these charges can vary significantly from period to period and  as a result  we may experience fluctuations in our reported net income and earnings per share due to the timing of restructuring actions  which in turn can cause fluctuations in our stock price 
further  the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we evaluate these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and base our estimates on experience  current and expected further conditions  third party evaluations and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities  as well as identifying and assessing the accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies 
we consider certain estimates and judgments that affect our future cash flow projections  including principal methods of competition such as volume  price  service  product performance and technical innovations 
actual results may differ from the estimates and assumptions used in our financial statements and related notes 
if the fair value is insufficient to recover the carrying value of our goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles  a material non cash charge to earnings could result 
at december   we had net goodwill and intangible assets of approximately  and shareholders equity of approximately  we account for goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

sfas no 
states that goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized but are reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
in accordance with the transition provisions of sfas no 
 we recorded a non cash impairment charge of during as a policy  we conduct annual impairment testing to determine if we will be able to recover all or a portion of the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles 
if the fair value is insufficient to recover the carrying value of our goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles  we may be required to write off a portion of the balance 
consistent with the requirements of sfas no 
 the fair values of our reporting units were based on discounted cash flow projections that are believed to be reasonable under current and forecasted circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of the reported net assets of our reporting units 
other considerations are also incorporated  including comparable industry price multiples 
based on the results of the impairment testing performed  no impairment of goodwill or indefinite lived intangibles existed as of december  many of our businesses closely follow changes in the industries and end markets that they serve 
accordingly  we consider estimates and judgments that affect the future cash flow projections including principal methods of competition such as volume  price  service  product performance and technical innovations as well as estimates associated with cost improvement initiatives  capacity utilization  and assumptions for inflation and foreign currency changes 
accordingly  we monitor impairment indicators across our industries and markets including  but not limited to  the power transmission  industrial tools  broadcast  telecommunications and warehouse construction markets 
any significant change in market conditions and estimates or judgments used to determine expected future cash flows that indicates a reduction in carrying value may give rise to impairment in the period that the change becomes known 
our strategy to outsource more of the various elements of the products we sell subjects us to the business risks of our suppliers  which could have a material adverse impact on our operations 
our increasing dependence on third party suppliers for outsourced products or components subjects us to the risk of customer dissatisfaction with the quality or performance of the products we sell because of supplier failure 
in addition  business difficulties experienced by a third party supplier can lead to the interruption of our ability to obtain the outsourced product and ultimately our inability to supply products to our customers 
third party supplier business interruptions can include  but are not limited to  work stoppages  union negotiations and other labor disputes  as well as financial and credit difficulties 
a portion of our revenues is generated through long term fixed price contracts  which could expose us to various risks including the risks of cost overruns  inflation and credit risks associated with certain customers 
a portion of our revenues and earnings is generated through long term fixed price contracts 
we recognize revenues from certain of these contracts using the percentage of completion method of accounting whereby revenue and expenses  and thereby profit  in a given period are determined based on our estimates as to the project status and the costs remaining to complete a particular project 
to the extent that we underestimate the remaining cost to complete a project  we may overstate the revenues and profit in a particular period 
further  certain of these contracts and our other contracts provide for penalties for failure to timely perform our obligations under a contract  or require that we  at our expense  correct and remedy to the satisfaction of the other party  certain defects 
we may enter into additional long term fixed price contracts of this type or other performance obligations in the future and there is no assurance that expenses relating to these provisions will not have a material adverse effect on our revenues and earnings 
we are subject to environmental and similar laws and potential liability relating to certain claims  complaints and proceedings  including those relating to environmental and other matters  arising in the ordinary course of business 
we are subject to various environmental laws  ordinances  regulations and other requirements of government authorities in the united states and other nations 
these requirements may include  for example  those governing discharges from and materials handled as part of our operations  the remediation of soil and groundwater contaminated by petroleum products or hazardous substances or wastes  and the health and safety of our employees 
under certain of these laws  ordinances or regulations  a current or previous owner or operator of property may be liable for the costs of investigation  removal or remediation of certain hazardous substances or petroleum products on  under  or in its property  without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of  or caused  the presence of the contaminants  and regardless of whether the practices that resulted in the contamination were legal at the time they occurred 
the presence of  or failure to remediate properly  these substances may have adverse effects  including  for example  substantial investigative or remedial obligations and limitations on the ability to sell or rent that property or to borrow funds using that property as collateral 
under certain of these laws  ordinances or regulations  a party that disposes of hazardous substances or wastes at a third party disposal facility may also become a responsible party required to share in the costs of site investigation and environmental remediation 
in connection with our acquisitions and divestitures  we may assume or retain significant environmental liabilities 
although we perform extensive due diligence with respect to acquisitions  divestitures and continuing operations  we may have environmental liabilities of which we are not aware 
future developments related to new or existing environmental matters or changes in environmental laws or policies could lead to material costs for environmental compliance or cleanup 
there can be no assurance that these liabilities and costs will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position in the future 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
numerous claims  complaints and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business  including but not limited to those relating to environmental matters  competitive issues  contract issues  intellectual property matters  personal injury and product liability claims  and workers compensation have been filed or are pending against us and certain of our subsidiaries 
additionally  we may become subject to significant claims of which we are currently unaware or the claims of which we are unaware may result in our incurring a significantly greater liability than we anticipate 
this may also be true in connection with past or future acquisitions 
while we maintain property  cargo  auto  product  general liability  and directors and officers liability insurance and have acquired rights under similar policies in connection with these acquisitions that we believe cover a portion of these claims  this insurance may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against potential loss exposures 
in addition  we have been increasing our self insurance limits over the past several years 
while we believe we are entitled to indemnification from third parties for some of these claims  these rights may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against potential loss exposures 
in our opinion  these matters are either without merit or are of a kind that should not have a material adverse effect individually or in the aggregate on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
however  we cannot assure you that recoveries from insurance or indemnification claims will be available or that any of these claims or other matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
see md a 
it is our policy to comply fully with applicable environmental requirements 
we are currently involved in various investigatory and remedial actions at our facilities and at third party waste disposal sites 
we accrue an estimate of loss  including expenses  from legal actions or claims when events exist that make the loss or expenses probable and we can reasonably estimate them 
our environmental accruals cover anticipated costs  including investigation  remediation  and operation and maintenance of clean up sites 
our estimates are based primarily on investigations and remediation plans developed by independent consultants  regulatory agencies and potentially responsible third parties 
accordingly  our estimates may change based on future developments  including new or changes in existing environmental laws or policies  a difference in costs required to complete anticipated actions from estimates provided  future findings of investigation or remediation actions  or alteration to the expected remediation plans 
it is our policy to realize a change in estimates once it becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated 
in determining our accruals  we do not discount environmental or other legal accruals and do not reduce them by anticipated insurance recoveries 
we do take into account third party indemnification from financially viable parties in determining our accruals where there is no dispute regarding the right to indemnification 
while we believe that our accruals related to environmental  litigation and other claims are sufficient and that these items and our rights to available insurance and indemnity will be resolved without material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and liquidity  individually or in the aggregate  we cannot assure you that our accruals and right to indemnity and insurance will be sufficient or that these items will be resolved without a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and liquidity  individually or in the aggregate 
we are subject to work stoppages  union negotiations  labor disputes and other matters associated with our labor force  which may adversely impact our profitability and cause us to incur incremental costs 
as of december   we had approximately  employees 
eighteen domestic collective bargaining units and various foreign collective labor arrangements cover approximately  employees 
while we generally have experienced satisfactory relations at our various locations  we are subject to potential union campaigns  work stoppages  union negotiations and potential labor disputes 
further  we may be subject to work stoppages  which are beyond our control  at our suppliers or customers 
difficulties presented by international economic  political  legal  accounting and business factors could negatively affect our interests and business effort 
in  approximately of our sales were international 
sales originating from germany and the united kingdom in were and  respectively 
we are seeking to increase our sales outside the united states 
our international operations require us to comply with the legal requirements of foreign jurisdictions and expose us to the political consequences of operating in foreign jurisdictions 
our foreign business operations also are subject to the following risks difficulty in managing  operating and marketing our international operations because of distance  as well as language and cultural differences  increased strength of the us dollar will increase the effective price of our products sold in us dollars  which may have a material adverse effect on sales or require us to lower our prices and also decrease our reported revenues or margins in respect of sales conducted in foreign currencies to the extent we are unable or determine not to increase local currency prices  likewise  decreased strength of the us dollar could have a material adverse effect on the cost of materials and products purchased overseas  difficulty entering new international markets due to greater regulatory barriers than the united states and differing political systems  increased costs due to domestic and foreign customs and tariffs  potentially adverse tax consequences  including imposition or increase of withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries  and transportation and shipping expenses  credit risk or financial condition of local customers and distributors  potential difficulties in staffing and labor disputes  risk of nationalization of private enterprises  government embargos or foreign trade restrictions such as anti dumping duties  increased costs of transportation or shipping  environmental laws and regulations  ability to obtain supplies from foreign vendors and ship products internationally during times of crisis or otherwise  potential difficulties in protecting intellectual property  increased worldwide hostilities including  but not limited to  military action in iraq  potential imposition of restrictions on investments  and local political  economic and social conditions  including the possibility of hyperinflationary conditions and political instability in certain countries 
as we continue to expand our international operations  these and other risks associated with international operations are likely to increase 
in addition  as we enter new geographic markets  we may encounter significant competition from the primary participants in those markets who may have significantly greater market knowledge and substantially greater resources than we do 
future increases in the number of shares of our outstanding common stock could adversely affect our common stock price or dilute our earnings per share 
sales of a substantial number of shares of common stock into the public market  or the perception that these sales could occur  could have a material adverse effect on our stock price 
if certain conditions are met  the lyons could be converted into shares of our common stock 
the shares that are covered by the february lyons and the may lyons have been registered under the securities act 
subject to adjustment  the lyons could be converted into an aggregate of shares of common stock 
in addition  as of december   approximately shares of our common stock are issuable upon exercise of outstanding stock options by employees and non employee directors 
additionally  we may issue a significant number of additional shares in connection with our acquisitions 
we also have a shelf registration statement for shares of common stock that may be issued in acquisitions  and we have a shelf registration statement for a total of  which may be used in connection with an offering of debt securities  preferred securities and or common stock for general corporate purposes 
any additional shares issued could have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share 
provisions in our corporate documents and delaware law may delay or prevent a change in control of our company  and  accordingly  we may not consummate a transaction that our shareholders consider favorable 
provisions of our certificate of incorporation and by laws may inhibit changes in our control not approved by our board 
these provisions include  for example a staggered board of directors  a prohibition on shareholder action by written consent  a requirement that special shareholder meetings be called only by our chairman  president and chief executive officer or our board  advance notice requirements for shareholder proposals and nominations  limitations on shareholders ability to amend  alter or repeal the by laws  enhanced voting requirements for certain business combinations involving substantial shareholders  the authority of our board to issue  without shareholder approval  preferred stock with terms determined in its discretion  and limitations on shareholders ability to remove directors 
we also have a shareholder rights plan designed to make it more costly and thus more difficult to gain control of us without the consent of our board 
in addition  we are afforded the protections of section of the delaware general corporation law  which could have similar effects 
in general  section prohibits us from engaging in a business combination with an interested shareholder each as defined in section for at least three years after the time the person became an interested shareholder unless certain conditions are met 
our technology is important to our success 
because many of our products rely on proprietary technology  we believe that the development and protection of our intellectual property rights is critical to the success of our business 
in order to maintain our market positions and margins  we need to continually develop and introduce high quality  technologically advanced and cost effective products on a timely basis 
the failure to do so could result in a significant competitive disadvantage 
additionally  despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties or competitors may copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology 
the steps we have taken may not prevent unauthorized use of our technology  particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk all amounts are in millions we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  and we selectively use financial instruments to manage these risks 
we do not enter into financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
we have interest rate protection agreements with financial institutions to limit exposure to interest rate volatility 
our currency exposures vary  but are primarily concentrated in the euro  canadian dollar  and british pound 
we generally do not hedge translation exposures 
the following table provides information  as of december   about our primary outstanding debt obligations and presents principal cash flows  weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates and fair values 
expected maturity date after total fair value long term debt senior notes average interest rate senior notes average interest rate lyons  fully accreted average interest rate term loans average interest rate there are various factors that a lyon holder would use in deciding to exercise its put option 
these factors include the price and volatility of our common stock  the interest yield on the lyons above the risk free interest rate and other quantitative and qualitative factors 
based upon the terms of the february and may lyons  holders may require us to purchase their lyons on february  and may   respectively 
if all the remaining february lyons were settled in cash on february   we would be required to pay the holders approximately if all the remaining may lyons were settled in cash on may   we would be required to pay the holders approximately due to the uncertainty surrounding the actual exercise of these put options  the full accreted value of the outstanding february and may lyons has been presented above based on their original maturity dates of february  and may   respectively 
as of december   we had outstanding variable rate term loans that bear interest  at our option  at libor plus the applicable rate or the abr plus the applicable rate 
the applicable rate is a defined term per our credit facility that is based upon our historical consolidated leverage ratio 
for these instruments  we had outstanding swaps that effectively converted  of our variable rate debt to a fixed rate of approximately 
we account for these swaps as cash flow hedges and they expire at various dates  with the longest expiring in november as of december   the interest rate swap agreements had a fair value recorded as a long term liability of we believe that current cash and equivalents  cash flows from operations and our unused revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund working capital needs  planned capital expenditures  other operational cash requirements and required debt service obligations for the foreseeable future 
in addition  we believe we have the ability and may elect to refinance the lyons  if put  with other debt
