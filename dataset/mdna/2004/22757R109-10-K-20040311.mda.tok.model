item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the trustee s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for the three year period ended december  in the trust s annual report to unitholders for the year ended december  is incorporated herein by reference 
liquidity and capital resources the trust s only cash requirement is the monthly distribution of its income to unitholders  which is funded by the monthly receipt of net profits income after payment of trust administration expenses 
the trust is not liable for any production costs or liabilities attributable to the net profits interests 
if at any time the trust receives net profits income in excess of the amount due  the trust is not obligated to return such overpayment  but future net profits income payable to the trust will be reduced by the overpayment  plus interest at the prime rate 
the trust may borrow funds required to pay trust liabilities if fully repaid prior to further distributions to unitholders 
the trust does not have any transactions  arrangements or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or persons that could materially affect the trust s liquidity or the availability of capital resources 
off balance sheet arrangements the trust has no off balance sheet financing arrangements 
the trust has not guaranteed the debt of any other party  nor does the trust have any other arrangements or relationships with other entities that could potentially result in unconsolidated debt  losses or contingent obligations 
contractual obligations as shown below  the trust had no obligations and commitments to make future contractual payments as of december   other than the december distribution payable to unitholders in january  as reflected in the statement of assets  liabilities and trust corpus 
payments due by period total less than year years years more than years distribution payable to unitholders related party transactions the underlying properties are currently owned by xto energy 
xto energy deducts an overhead charge from monthly net proceeds as reimbursement for costs associated with monitoring the net profits interests 
as of december   this monthly charge was   net to the trust and is subject to annual adjustment based on an oil and gas industry index 
for further information regarding the trust s relationship with xto energy  see note to financial statements in the trust s annual report to unitholders for the year ended december  critical accounting policies the financial statements of the trust are significantly affected by its basis of accounting and estimates related to its oil and gas properties and proved reserves  as summarized below 
basis of accounting the trust s financial statements are prepared on a modified cash basis  which is a comprehensive basis of accounting other than generally accepted accounting principles 
this method of accounting is consistent with reporting of taxable income to trust unitholders 
the most significant differences between the trust s financial statements and those prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles are net profits income is recognized in the month received rather than accrued in the month of production 
expenses are recognized when paid rather than when incurred 
cash reserves may be established by the trustee for certain contingencies that would not be recorded under generally accepted accounting principles 
for further information regarding the trust s basis of accounting  see note to financial statements in the trust s annual report to unitholders for the year ended december  all amounts included in the trust s financial statements are based on cash amounts received or disbursed  or on the carrying value of the net profits interests  which was derived from the historical cost of the interests at the date of their transfer from xto energy  less accumulated amortization to date 
accordingly  there are no fair value estimates included in the financial statements based on either exchange or nonexchange trade values 
oil and gas reserves the trust s proved oil and gas reserves are estimated by independent petroleum engineers 
reserve engineering is a subjective process that is dependent upon the quality of available data and the interpretation thereof 
estimates by different engineers often vary  sometimes significantly 
in addition  physical factors such as the results of drilling  testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate  as well as economic factors such as changes in product prices  may justify revision of such estimates 
because proved reserves are required to be estimated using prices at the date of the evaluation  estimated reserve quantities can be significantly impacted by changes in product prices 
accordingly  oil and gas quantities ultimately recovered and the timing of production may be substantially different from original estimates 
the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows and changes in such cash flows  as reported in item of the trust s annual report on form k  is prepared using assumptions required by the financial accounting standards board and the securities and exchange commission 
such assumptions include using year end oil and gas prices and year end costs for estimated future development and production expenditures 
discounted future net cash flows are calculated using a rate 
changes in any of these assumptions  including consideration of other factors  could have a significant impact on the standardized measure 
accordingly  the standardized measure does not represent xto energy s or the trustee s estimated current market value of proved reserves 
forward looking statements certain information included in this annual report and other materials filed  or to be filed  by the trust with the securities and exchange commission as well as information included in oral statements or other written statements made or to be made by xto energy or the trustee contain forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  and section a of the securities act of  as amended  relating to the trust operations of the underlying properties and the oil and gas industry 
such forward looking statements may concern  among other things  development activities  increased density drilling  maintenance projects  development  production and other costs  oil and gas prices  pricing differentials  proved reserves  payout on reversion properties  production levels  litigation  regulatory matters and competition 
such forward looking statements are based on xto energy s current plans  expectations  assumptions  projections and estimates and are identified by words such as expects  intends  plans  projects  anticipates  predicts  believes  goals  estimates  should  could  and similar words that convey the uncertainty of future events 
these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks  uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict 
therefore  actual results may differ materially from expectations  estimates or assumptions expressed in  implied in  or forecasted in such forward looking statements 
some of the risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are discussed below 
oil and gas price fluctuations 
the trust s monthly cash distributions are highly dependent upon the prices realized from the sale of gas and  to a lesser extent  oil 
oil and gas prices can fluctuate widely on a month to month basis in response to a variety of factors that are beyond the control of the trust and xto energy 
factors that contribute to price fluctuations include instability in oil producing regions  worldwide economic conditions  weather conditions  the supply and price of foreign oil and gas  consumer demand  and the price and availability of alternative fuels 
moreover  government regulations  such as regulation of natural gas transportation and price controls  can affect product prices in the long term 
lower oil and gas prices may reduce the amount of oil and gas that is economic to produce and will reduce net profits available to the trust 
the volatility of energy prices reduces the predictability of future cash distributions to trust unitholders 
increased production and development costs 
production and development costs on the net profits interests properties are deducted in the calculation of the trust s share of net proceeds 
accordingly  higher or lower production and development costs  without concurrent increases in revenue  will directly decrease or increase the amount received by the trust for its net profits interests 
if development and production costs of the net profits interests located in a particular state exceed the production proceeds from the properties  the trust will not receive net proceeds for those properties until future proceeds from production in that state exceed the total of the excess costs plus accrued interest during the deficit period 
development activities may not generate sufficient additional revenue to repay the costs 
reserve estimates 
estimating reserves is inherently uncertain 
petroleum engineers consider many factors and make assumptions in estimating reserves and future net cash flows 
lower oil and gas prices generally cause lower estimates of proved reserves 
ultimately  actual production  revenues and expenditures for the underlying properties will vary from estimates and those variations could be material 
the trust s reserve quantities are based on estimates of reserves for the underlying properties 
the method of allocating a portion of those reserves to the trust is complicated because the trust holds an interest in net profits and does not own a specific percentage of the oil and gas reserves 
operating risks 
the occurrence of drilling  production or transportation accidents at any of the underlying working interest properties will reduce trust distributions by the amount of uninsured costs 
these accidents may result in personal injuries  property damage  damage to productive formations or equipment and environmental damages 
any uninsured costs would be deducted as production costs in calculating net proceeds payable to the trust 
no control over the operation or development of underlying properties 
because xto energy does not operate most of the underlying properties  it is unable to significantly influence the operations or future development of the underlying properties 
neither the trustee nor the trust unitholders can influence or control the operation or future development of the underlying properties 
the current operators of the underlying properties are under no obligation to continue operating the properties 
neither the trustee nor trust unitholders have the right to replace an operator 
trust s assets are depleting assets 
the net proceeds payable to the trust are derived from the sale of depleting assets 
accordingly  the portion of the distributions to trust unitholders attributable to depletion may be considered a return of capital 
the reduction in proved reserve quantities is a common measure of the depletion 
future maintenance and development projects on the underlying properties will affect the quantity of proved reserves 
the timing and size of these projects will depend on the market prices of oil and gas 
if operators of the properties do not implement additional maintenance and development projects  the future rate of production decline of proved reserves may be higher than the rate currently expected by xto energy 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the only assets of and sources of income to the trust are the net profits interests  which generally entitle the trust to receive a share of the net profits from oil and gas production from the underlying properties 
consequently  the trust is exposed to market risk from fluctuations in oil and gas prices 
the trust is a passive entity and  other than the trust s ability to periodically borrow money as necessary to pay expenses  liabilities and obligations of the trust that cannot be paid out of cash held by the trust  the trust is prohibited from engaging in borrowing transactions 
the amount of any such borrowings is unlikely to be material to the trust 
in addition  the trustee is prohibited by the trust indenture from engaging in any business activity or causing the trust to enter into any investments other than investing cash on hand in specific short term cash investments 
therefore  the trust cannot hold any derivative financial instruments 
as a result of the limited nature of its borrowing and investing activities  the trust is not subject to any material interest rate market risk 
additionally  any gains or losses from any hedging activities conducted by xto energy are specifically excluded from the calculation of net proceeds due the trust under the forms of the conveyances 
the trust does not engage in transactions in foreign currencies which could expose the trust to any foreign currency related market risk
