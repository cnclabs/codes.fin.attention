item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our operations are grouped into two segments x software and related systems and services x data center service bureau services results of operations fixed price software development contracts and licenses accounted for of consolidated revenue for each of the years ended december  and we recognize revenue for fixed price contracts on the estimated percentage of completion basis 
since the billing schedules under the contracts differ from the recognition of revenue  at the end of any period  these contracts generally result in either costs and estimated profits in excess of billing or billing in excess of cost and estimated profits 
revenue from fixed price software development contracts is determined using the percentage of completion method which is based upon the time spent by our technical personnel on a project 
as a result  during the third and fourth quarters  when many of our employees are on vacation and holidays  our revenue is affected 
our time spent on projects during the second half of the year can generally range from to less than time spent on projects during the first half of the year

the increase in working capital also included million in net proceeds from the exercise of our stock options and warrants 
these increases were partially offset by the costs related to the carenet acquisition  which utilized approximately  of our cash

with respect to the million investment in the our new facility  we negotiated with our new landlord a rent free period of ten months  which will result in approximately  of cash savings which will partially offset the investment we have made 
in june  we entered into a revolving credit and term loan agreement with fleet bank fleet 
this financing provides us with a five year term loan of million  as well as a two year million revolving line of credit 
the million line of credit expired in june we did not utilize this line of credit during its duration 
we are currently exploring our options with fleet  relating to the possible increase in its term loan to be used for acquisitions  as well as an additional term loan to assist in costs associated with the relocation of our corporate headquarters 
the current term loan bears interest at libor plus 
we have entered into an interest rate swap agreement with fleet for the amount outstanding under the term loan whereby we converted our variable rate on the term loan to a fixed rate of in order to reduce the interest rate risk associated with these borrowings

purchases of stock will be made from time to time  depending on market conditions  in open market or in privately negotiated transactions  at prices deemed appropriate by management 
there is no set time limit on the purchases 
we expect to fund any stock repurchases from our operating cash flow 
as of december   we have not made any stock repurchases 
on june   we acquired substantially all of the assets of the carenet segment of shuttle data systems corporation  d b a adia information management corp  pursuant to an asset purchase agreement dated june   among the netsmart  adia and steven heintz  jr  the president and majority shareholder of adia 
the principal assets acquired were the intellectual property and customer contracts of carenet 
the total purchase price  including acquisition costs  was  which consisted of  shares of common stock valued at   in cash  and a three year promissory note in the principal amount of  payable in equal monthly installments of principal plus interest at the prime rate plus 
the cash portion of the purchase price was paid for out of existing working capital 
we also assumed certain contractual obligations and liabilities totaling  and incurred  in legal and accounting costs which are included in the purchase price 
the cost of the acquisition was allocated to purchased software in the amount of  customer lists in the amount of  and computer hardware in the amount of  we are amortizing the purchased software over an eight year life and the customer lists over a nine year life 
in addition  in connection with the acquisition  we entered into a non compete and non solicitation agreement with steven heintz  jr 
and jennifer lindbert for which they were paid a fee of an aggregate  which fee was paid in cash out of existing working capital and is included in other assets on the balance sheet 
the covenant not to compete is currently being amortized over a three year life 
we accounted for this acquisition pursuant to the purchase method of accounting 
for accounting purposes we recorded the assets and related liabilities of carenet effective as of june  we incorporated the operations of carenet into our operations commencing july  in  we incurred capitalized software development costs of  relating to our avatar am  order entry and rad plus products 
the avatar am and order entry products are being amortized over a three year period and in  we charged to  to operations 
a part of our growth strategy is to acquire other businesses that are related to our current business 
such acquisitions may be made with cash  our securities or a combination of cash and securities 
if we fail to make any acquisitions our future growth will be limited to only internal growth 
as of the date of this form k annual report  we did not have any formal or informal agreements or understandings with respect to any material acquisitions  and we cannot give any assurance that we will be able to complete any material acquisitions 
based on our outstanding contracts and our continuing business  we believe that our cash flow from operations and our cash on hand will be sufficient to enable us to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months 
it is possible that we may need additional funding if we go forward with certain acquisitions or if our business does not develop as we anticipate or if our expenses  including our software development costs relating to our expansion of our product line and our marketing costs for seeking to expand the market for our products and services to include smaller clinics and facilities and sole group practitioners  exceed our expectation 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these accounting principles require us to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions 
we believe that the estimates  judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates  judgments and assumptions are made 
these estimates  judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
among other things  estimates are used in accounting for allowances for bad debts  deferred income taxes  expected realizable values of assets primarily capitalized software development costs and customer lists and revenue recognition 
to the extent there are material differences between these estimates  judgments or assumptions and actual results  our financial statements will be affected 
the significant accounting policies that we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following revenue recognition capitalized software development costs impairment of customer lists revenue recognition revenue associated with fixed price turnkey sales consists of the following components licensing of software  labor associated with the installation and implementation of the software  and maintenance services rendered in connection with such licensing activities 
revenue from fixed price software development contracts and revenue under license agreements  which require significant modification of the software package to the customer s specifications  are recognized utilizing the estimated percentage of completion method which uses the units of work performed method to measure progress towards completion 
revisions in cost estimates and recognition of losses on these contracts are reflected in the accounting period in which the facts become known 
the complexity of the estimation process and issues related to the assumptions  risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of the percentage of completion method of accounting affect the amounts of revenue and related expenses reported in our consolidated financial statements 
a number of internal and external factors can affect our estimates  including labor rates  utilization and efficiency variances and specification and testing requirement changes 
maintenance contract revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the life of the respective contract 
we also derive revenue from the sale of third party hardware and software which is recognized based upon the terms of each contract 
consulting revenue is recognized when the services are rendered 
data center revenue is recognized in the period in which the service is provided 
the above sources of revenue are recognized when  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed and determinable and collectibility is probable 
contract terms provide for billing schedules that differ from revenue recognition and give rise to costs and estimated profits in excess of billings  and billings in excess of costs and estimated profits 
deferred revenue represents revenue billed and collected but not yet earned 
the cost of maintenance revenue  which consists solely of staff payroll and applicable overhead  is expensed as incurred 
capitalized software development costs capitalization of computer software development costs begins upon the establishment of technological feasibility and ends upon its availability for general release to customers 
technological feasibility for our computer software products is generally based upon achievement of a detail program design free of high risk development issues 
the company capitalizes only those costs directly attributable to the development of the software 
the establishment of technological feasibility and the ongoing assessment of recoverability of capitalized computer software development costs requires considerable judgment by management with respect to certain external factors  including  but not limited to  technological feasibility  anticipated future gross revenue  estimated economic life and changes in software and hardware technology 
prior to reaching technological feasibility these costs are expensed as incurred and included in research  development and maintenance 
activities undertaken after the products are available for general release to customers to correct errors or keep the product updated are expensed as incurred and included in research  development and maintance 
amortization of capitalized computer software development costs commences when the related products become available for general release to customers 
amortization is provided on a product by product basis 
the annual amortization is the greater of the amount computed using a the ratio that current gross revenue for a product bear to the total of current and anticipated future gross revenue for that product or b the straight line method over the remaining estimated economic life of the product 
the estimated life of these products range from to years 
we periodically perform reviews of the recoverability of such capitalized software costs 
at the time a determination is made that capitalized amounts are not recoverable based on the estimated cash flows to be generated from the applicable software  any remaining capitalized amounts are written off 
impairment of customer lists pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we evaluate our long lived assets for financial impairment  and continue to evaluate them as events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable 
we evaluate the recoverability of long lived assets by measuring the carrying amount of the assets against the estimated undiscounted future cash flows associated with them 
at the time such evaluations indicate that the future undiscounted cash flows of certain long lived assets are not sufficient to recover the carrying amount of such assets  the assets are adjusted to their fair values

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
most of our debt is at fixed rates of interest after completing an interest rate swap agreement  which effectively converted our variable rate debt into a fixed rate debt of 
therefore  if the libor rate plus increases above  it may have a positive effect on our net income 
most of our invested cash and cash equivalents  which are invested in money market accounts and commercial paper  are at variable rates of interest 
if market interest rates decrease by percent from levels at december   the effect on our net income would be a decrease of approximately  per year
