the discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes 
all dollar amounts are in millions except share and per share amounts 
all references to notes are to notes to the consolidated financial statements 
prior share amounts and earnings per share have been restated to give retroactive effect to the company s stock dividend  which was effective in april company profile overview jefferson pilot corporation is a holding company whose financial services and broadcasting subsidiaries provide products and services in four major businesses life insurance  annuities and investment products  group life  disability and dental insurance  and broadcasting and sports programming production 
our principal life insurance subsidiaries are jefferson pilot life insurance company jp life  jefferson pilot financial insurance company jpfic and its wholly owned subsidiary  jefferson pilot lifeamerica insurance company jpla 
jefferson pilot communications company jpcc and its wholly owned subsidiaries conduct our broadcasting operations 
jefferson pilot securities corporation with related entities  jpsc is a registered non clearing broker dealer that sells affiliated and non affiliated variable life and annuity products and other investment products 
in our three financial services segments  effective investment management and asset liability management are important to our financial position and results of operations 
interest spread  which represents the difference between interest earned on our investments and interest credited to policyholder funds  is a key component of our reportable segment results 
the earned rate on our investments has declined in recent years as a result of a decline in the general interest rate environment 
we establish credited rates within a highly competitive market for financial products 
in establishing these rates  we start with an analysis of rates credited by other insurance companies and also compare rates offered by other financial services providers  such as bank certificates of deposit 
these rates may impact the level of new sales or retention of existing customers 
we believe that the historically low interest rate levels that we are currently experiencing will continue to challenge our earnings progression 
our operating results are also dependent on the level of mortality death and morbidity disability and health costs we incur 
we attempt to address these conditions through underwriting risk selection and classification  by adjusting policyholder crediting rates to achieve desired spread performance  by monitoring claim and industry health care trend reports  and through a focus on conservative product designs 
also  we record substantial intangible asset balances because of commissions and expenses incurred in selling new policies  and because of acquisitions dac  voba  goodwill 
the assumptions that we use in accounting for these intangible assets are important to our reported results 
for a more complete explanation of these important concepts  please see the critical accounting policies  financial position  investments and market risk exposures sections of this report 
we use reportable segment results in assessing the performance of our business segments internally and believe it to be relevant and useful information 
in the following discussion  reportable segment results and total reportable segment results include all elements of net income available to common stockholders except realized investment gains and losses 
reportable segment results as described above may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
our individual products segment sells life insurance on individuals  through which we underwrite the economic risks of mortality and provide vehicles for the accumulation of individual savings 
we select and classify mortality risks  using actuarial science  within a competitive marketplace in accordance with various state and federal regulations 
because we earn revenues for accepting mortality risks  the growth in face amount of insurance in force is a key measure for a portion of our revenue growth 
because individual products operates under two distinct accounting models  we further analyze this segment by its two main product types ul type products and traditional products 
ul type products offered by this segment include universal life ul and variable universal life vul products 
ul type product premiums may vary over the life of the policy at the discretion of the policyholder  so we do not recognize them as revenues when received  although ul type premiums do increase assets and liabilities 
we earn spreads between interest earned and credited to policyholders from aggregation and investment of policyholder funds 
in managing these spreads  we develop and maintain systems and skills that are necessary to understand and mitigate credit and interest rate risks 
we also recognize revenues on these products from mortality  expense and surrender charges earned policy charges 
trends in policyholder fund balances and segment assets are important measures when analyzing the development of segment earnings 
due to competition from other financial services providers  it is important that we achieve continuing improvements in internal cost efficiencies in relation to policies administered and assets under management 
traditional products require the policyholder to pay scheduled premiums over the life of the coverage 
we recognize traditional premium receipts as revenues and profits are expected to emerge in relation thereto 
because of market preferences  we do not offer new traditional products except for some term life insurance 
product development is important to growth in sales 
we operate within a competitive marketplace by offering products that respond to demographic changes  the evolving financial needs of our customers  and regulatory requirements 
we currently sell individual life insurance products designed to provide our customers vehicles for wealth accumulation  mortality protection  and a balance between those two objectives 
because this segment issues long duration contracts  sales results may not materially impact current period profitability  but longer term sales trends are an important indicator of future growth in reportable segment results 
our annuity and investment product aip segment primarily offers our proprietary fixed annuity products 
we also sell mutual funds and other investment products through our broker dealer 
we earn interest spreads and policy charges on our annuity products  and recognize revenues from concession income earned on investment product sales by our broker dealer 
the principal source of reportable segment results is investment spreads on policyholder fund balances 
investment selection and matching of interest rate risk profiles of investments to those of policyholder fund balances are critical to achieving successful results within this segment 
in recent years  historically low levels of interest rates have reduced the margin between rates we credit to policyholder accounts and those that are guaranteed under contractual provisions  and therefore will limit our ability to reduce crediting rates 
we have responded to that exposure through innovative product designs that reduce spreads required to achieve desired returns 
because we derive a majority of our earnings from spread management activities  trends in policyholder fund balances and effective investment spreads earned are both important drivers of reportable segment results 
product development activities are important to providing appropriate products to a highly competitive marketplace 
we have introduced new products with fixed interest and equity index components in recent months that have contributed to improving sales trends  whereas sales of traditional fixed interest  multi year guarantee products declined in the two most recent years because of competition from other financial services providers within a declining interest rate environment 
new fixed annuity premium sales and surrenders of existing policies are both key indicators of growth in policyholder fund balances 
our benefit partners segment insures individuals for mortality  morbidity and dental costs under master group insurance contracts with employers 
this segment offers various forms of contributory and noncontributory plans  as well as supplemental contracts 
most of our group contracts are sold to employers with fewer than employees 
we select and classify risks within a competitive marketplace based on group characteristics  applying actuarial science and group underwriting practices 
we may adjust premiums charged for insuring group risks  usually on an annual basis  in relation to evolving group characteristics and subject to policyholder acceptance 
insurance products offered by this segment to the employer marketplace include group non medical products  principally term life  disability and dental insurance 
as these are traditional products  we recognize premium receipts from this segment as revenues and profits are expected to emerge in proportion to the revenue recognized 
because group underwriting risks may change over time  management focuses on trends in loss ratios to compare actual experience with pricing expectations 
also  expense ratios are an important factor in profitability since group insurance contracts are offered within an environment that competes on the basis of price and service 
reported sales relate to long duration contracts sold to new policyholders 
the trend in sales is an important indicator of development of business in force over time 
in march  we acquired canada life s us based group life  disability and dental business 
following this acquisition  we are positioned with approximately billion of annual group life  disability and dental premiums  one third of which is due to the acquisition 
our communications segment consists of radio and television broadcasting operations located in selected markets in the southeastern and western united states  and sports program production 
we generate revenues for this segment through advertising  sales of programming rights and other programming compensation 
management evaluates the performance of our broadcast stations using a number of metrics including audience levels ratings  growth in audiences  revenue growth  relative share of market revenues  and operating efficiencies  with the ultimate goal of achieving growth in broadcast cash flow 
we focus our efforts at the local level  combining sound business practices with service to the community 
we monitor each station s product through market research and tailor the product to our target audience s tastes and listening viewing habits 
we attempt to maximize revenues and increase revenue share by focusing on management of commercial inventory and pricing 
we achieve operating efficiencies by exercising tight expense control at both the local and corporate levels 
our corporate and other segment contains the activities of the parent company and passive investment affiliates  surplus of the life insurance subsidiaries not allocated to other reportable segments  financing expenses on corporate debt  strategic initiatives intended to benefit the entire company  and federal and state income taxes not otherwise allocated to business segments 
we include all realized gains and losses on investments in the corporate and other segment  and hold all defaulted securities in this segment 
realized investment gains are gains and losses on sales and write downs of investments  and although these are included in revenues  we exclude them in assessing the performance of our business segments 
the company s business segments  operating results  risks and opportunities are discussed in further detail in the sections that follow 
segment revenues the revenues for our reportable segments  excluding realized gains and losses  were as follows year ended individual products aip benefit partners communications corporate and other critical accounting policies general we have identified the accounting policies below as critical to the understanding of our results of operations and our financial position 
the application of these critical accounting policies in preparing our financial statements requires management to use significant judgments and estimates concerning future results or other developments including the likelihood  timing or amount of one or more future transactions or amounts 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  assumptions and judgments based upon historical experience and various other information that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
for a detailed discussion of other significant accounting policies  see note dac  voba and unearned revenue the individual products  aip and benefit partners segments defer the costs of acquiring new business 
these costs include first year commissions and group sales representative incentive compensation  first year bonus interest or day one premium bonuses on annuities  certain costs of underwriting and issuing policies plus agency office expenses 
these deferred expenses are referred to as deferred acquisition costs dac 
we limit our capitalization of acquisition costs other than commissions in the individual and aip segments to the lower of product specific pricing allowables or the actual deferrable acquisition costs 
when we acquire new business through an acquisition  we allocate a portion of the purchase price to a separately identifiable intangible asset  referred to as value of business acquired voba 
we initially establish voba as the actuarially determined present value of future gross profits of each business acquired 
both dac and voba reflect our expectations about the future experience of business in force 
our primary assumptions regarding future experience that can affect the carrying value of dac and voba balances include mortality  interest spreads and policy lapse rates 
significant changes in these assumptions can impact the amortization of dac and voba in both the current and future periods  which is reflected in earnings 
our unearned revenue reserves result from the deferral of policy charges on certain products with large up front expense charges 
these reserves are amortized into income over periods similar to those used for dac and voba 
both the deferral and amortization of unearned revenue reserves are reported in ul and investment product charges 
see the financial position section for further discussion of these items including a sensitivity analysis regarding the impact of changes in critical assumptions or expectations 
investments we regularly monitor our investment portfolio to ensure that investments that may be other than temporarily impaired are identified in a timely fashion and properly valued  and that any impairments are charged against earnings in the proper period 
our methodology to identify potential other than temporary impairments  requires professional judgment and is further described in the investments section and in note valuing our investment portfolio involves a variety of assumptions and estimates  particularly for investments that are not actively traded 
we rely on external pricing sources for highly liquid publicly traded securities and use an internal pricing matrix for privately placed securities 
this matrix relies on our judgment concerning the discount rate we use in calculating expected future cash flows  credit quality  industry sector performance  and expected maturity 
under certain circumstances  we make adjustments as we apply professional judgment based upon specific detailed information concerning the issuer 
as the discussion above indicates  many judgments are involved in timely identifying and valuing securities  including other than temporary impairments on securities 
inherently  there are risks and uncertainties involved in making these judgments 
see the discussion of investments and note for further details 
critical assumptions and changes in circumstances such as a weak economy  an economic downturn or unforeseen events which affect one or more companies  industry sectors or countries could result in additional write downs in future periods for impairments that are deemed to be other than temporary 
litigation in recent years  the life insurance industry has experienced increased litigation in which large jury awards including punitive damages or settlements in lieu of litigation have occurred 
establishing accruals for specific litigation inherently involves a variety of estimates of future potential outcomes 
accordingly  management  based on the advice of internal and external counsel  reviews each specific litigation matter and makes a judgment whether it is probable we have incurred a loss 
once it is determined that a loss is probable  we use professional judgment in determining whether we can reasonably estimate the loss 
in general  we accrue the estimated costs of defense until we can reasonably estimate the loss or any potential range of possible loss 
at that time  these additional costs are accrued 
based on consultation with our legal advisors  we believe that resolution of pending legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or liquidity but could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations for a specific period 
see further discussion in note results of operations the following tables illustrate our results before and after realized investment gains and losses  and reconcile reportable segment results to net income available to common stockholders  the most directly comparable gaap financial measure favorable unfavorable vs

these net investment losses in and were primarily the result of other than temporary bond impairments  partially offset in by realized gains from sales of equity securities 
total reportable segment results increased in driven by growth in all segments 
an increase in interest spreads benefited our individual and our aip lines and effective expense management benefited the whole organization 
the results were primarily influenced by an increase in the accrual for pending litigation in our corporate segment which offset growth in our aip  communications and benefit partners segments 
earnings per share amounts for the reportable segments were more favorable than the absolute earnings amounts due to repurchases of  shares in and  shares in results by business segment we assess profitability by business segment and measure other operating statistics as detailed in the separate segment discussions that follow 
we determine reportable segments in a manner consistent with the way we make operating decisions and assess performance 
sales are one of the statistics we use to track performance

sales in our core agency channels were up in and were strongest in the latter part of the year as additional products were brought to market 
with these new product offerings no single product comprised more than of total sales in the fourth quarter of sales to community banks and boli business declined in both and community bank and boli business will vary widely between periods as we respond to sales opportunities for these single premium products only when the market accommodates our required returns 
interest margin on ul type products grew in  despite lower investment yields  due to growth in policyholder fund balances and an increase in average interest spread 
the lower investment yield was due to the general interest rate environment and an increase in default charges paid from the individual products segment to the corporate and other segment of as discussed under corporate and other 
we actively manage interest spreads on our fixed ul type products in response to changes in investment yields by adjusting the rates credited to policyholder fund balances while considering our competitive strategies as well 
the average investment spread on fixed ul products increased basis points to in after having decreased basis points in during and  prepayments of mortgage backed securities significantly increased as a result of continued declines in long term mortgage rates 
our mortgage backed securities portfolio is primarily a discount portfolio 
the effect of prepayments in excess of expected levels increased effective investment yields by and basis points in and prepayments were not significant in of the basis point investment yield impact in  only a portion affected interest margin due to partial pass through of the higher yield to policyholders through crediting rates 
dac amortization and income taxes also reduce the earnings impact of excess accretion of discount 
our ability to manage interest crediting rates on fixed ul type products is limited by minimum guaranteed rates provided in policyholder contracts 
therefore  continued low general market interest rates may impact future profitability  as the investment of cash flows at current interest rates reduces our average portfolio yield 
at the end of and  our crediting rates were approximately and basis points on average in excess of our minimum guaranteed rates  including some policies that were already at their minimum guaranteed rates 
due to strong growth in expense charges and of cost of insurance charges associated with a reinsurance recapture  product charge revenue grew at a rate faster than average ul policyholder fund balances in excluding this recapture  product charge revenue in grew over products issued in recent years are designed to generate more of their revenues from expense charges 
we defer expense charges received in excess of ultimate annual expense charges and amortize them into income relative to future estimated gross profits

absent this item  the increase in over was 
death benefits  net of reinsurance  per thousand dollars of face amount of insurance in force were for compared to for and for cost of insurance charges have grown as well 
these trends relate to growth in average face amount of insurance in force and aging of our blocks 
changes in product design also impact cost of insurance charges 
traditional premiums and other considerations declined in both and as we are focusing our sales efforts towards ul type products and because in we began reinsuring of our term life insurance sales 
net investment income from our traditional blocks declined in despite a favorable impact from prepayments of mortgage backed securities  due to the decline in investment yields and the decreasing size of the block 
policy benefits on traditional business include death benefits  dividends  surrenders and changes in reserves  with the most significant being death benefits 
policy benefits as a percentage of premiums and other considerations were in  down slightly from in the benefit ratio was in  reflecting favorable mortality experience in that year 
total expenses including the net deferral and amortization of dac and voba are as follows favorable unfavorable vs 
vs 
commissions general and administrative acquisition related general and administrative maintenance related taxes  licenses and fees total commissions and expenses incurred less commissions and expenses capitalized expenses excluding amortization of dac and voba amortization of dac and voba total expense expenses excluding amortization of dac and voba were down in due to a reduction in the effective rate of premium taxes  and effective expense controls in our maintenance functions 
the expense amounts we capitalize as dac include first year commissions and deferrable acquisition expenses 
we generally limit our capitalization of deferrable acquisition expenses to the lower of product specific pricing allowables or our actual deferrable acquisition costs 
see further discussion of dac and voba under the financial position section 
the decline in expenses excluding amortization of dac and voba in from was primarily a function of increased deferral of acquisition related general and administrative expenses stemming from the significant increase in sales in recent years sales growth combined with higher emergence of gross profits on ul type products  particularly interest margin and expense charges in  were the primary contributors to the increases in the amortization of dac and voba 
unlocking of dac assumptions reduced dac amortization on fixed ul products by and in and the unlocking pertained primarily to assumptions regarding interest spreads and mortality  while the unlocking was related primarily to persistency assumptions 
the unlocking was partially offset by a increase in amortization on vul products due to limitation of mean reversion techniques  as discussed in the financial position section 
the growth in average individual products assets in and was primarily due to growth in ul policyholder fund balances  partially offset by a decline in assets supporting our traditional block of business 
in  market values of separate account assets of variable products declined  which hindered the growth in average assets for this segment 
our financial and operating risks for this segment include  among others  interest margin risks  mortality risks  variances between actual and underlying assumptions of dac and voba  changes in taxation of our products and competing offerings  and the effects of unresolved litigation 
we discuss these risks in more detail in the financial position  capital resources and liquidity  and market risk exposures sections 
see note for a discussion of statement of position  a new accounting pronouncement that is effective january   which may significantly impact the timing of this segment s earnings emergence in and beyond  depending on the outcome of evolving implementation guidance

fixed annuity premium sales variable annuity premium sales investment product sales average policyholder fund balances average separate account policyholder fund balances average assets effective investment spreads for fixed annuities fixed annuity surrenders as a percentage of beginning fund balances fixed annuity premium sales declined in and reflecting continued competition in the fixed annuity market and our unwillingness to match our competitors crediting rates  especially in the bank channel 
sales trends showed substantial improvement in late as approximately of our total fixed annuity premium sales for came in the fourth quarter  following the introduction of a new product portfolio with fixed interest and equity indexed components 
we continue to develop differentiated annuity products designed to create new distribution opportunities and strengthen existing marketing relationships 
our policy charge income declined in both and as our product mix focused more on products that derived most of their earnings from investment spreads rather than from policy charges  and as a result of lower surrenders 
net investment income growth was lower than the growth in average policyholder fund balances  primarily due to a decline in investment yields 
the effect of the prepayments of mortgage backed securities in excess of expected levels in the aip segment increased effective yields by and basis points in and prepayments were not significant in of the basis point investment yield impact in  only a portion impacted effective investment spreads on fixed annuities due to partial pass through of the higher yield to policyholders through crediting rates 
dac amortization and income taxes also reduce the earnings impact of excess accretion of discount 
we actively manage spreads on fixed annuity products in response to changes in our investment portfolio yields by adjusting the interest rates we credit on annuity policyholder fund balances while considering our competitive strategies 
effective investment spreads on fixed annuities increased in after having decreased in our ability to manage interest crediting rates on fixed annuity products is limited by minimum guaranteed rates provided in policyholder contracts  and continued low general market interest rates will impact future profitability  as the investment of cash flows at current interest rates reduces our average portfolio yield 
we have approximately billion of fixed annuity policyholder fund balances with crediting rates that are reset on an annual basis  and our crediting rates on average are approximately basis points in excess of our minimum guaranteed rates at december  of the remaining billion of fixed annuity policyholder fund balances  approximately billion have multi year guaranteed rates  which will begin to reset in the second half of our recent sales have been of products with lower guaranteed minimum rates and lower spread requirements  developed in response to the declining interest rate environment 
policy benefits  which are mainly comprised of interest credited to policyholder accounts  decreased in despite growth in average policyholder fund balances  reflecting crediting rate actions we took as part of our management of investment spreads 
fixed annuity surrenders as a percentage of beginning fund balances declined in and  reflecting the effects of the lower interest rate environment and the increased percentage of our annuity block with multi year crediting rate guarantees 
the surrender rate in the aip segment is influenced by many other factors such as the portion of the business that has low or no remaining surrender charges  competition from annuity products including those which pay up front interest rate bonuses or higher market rates  and rising interest rates that may make returns available on new annuities or investment products more attractive than our older annuities 
fixed annuity fund balances with surrender charges of or more decreased to at year end from at year end total expenses including the net deferral and amortization of dac and voba were as follows favorable unfavorable vs

also  reflected a decrease in amortization of due to lower lapse rates on fixed annuity products  partially offset by an increase in amortization on variable annuity products using the mean reversion techniques discussed in the financial position section 
risks in the annuity business other than those mentioned in our overview are that equity market volatility could reduce demand for our products with interest credited rates indexed to those markets  increased lapses when interest rates rise  particularly in the portion of business subject to low or no surrender charges  and changes in taxation of our products and competing offerings 
we discuss these risks in more detail in the financial position  capital resources and liquidity  and market risk exposures sections

also  in we tightened certain underwriting rules and strengthened our sales focus on higher margin  smaller case business 
the increases in policy benefits in and were driven by growth in overall business coupled with an increased loss ratio  primarily related to adverse mortality experience in our life business 
accordingly  we made pricing increases to address an isolated segment of our life line of business that was under performing  and we implemented greater management scrutiny of larger cases  especially renewals of groups with adverse experience 
going forward  we expect these actions to progressively improve our reportable segment results

in march  we acquired canada life s group life  disability and dental business 
this transaction resulted in a commitment of approximately of capital 
this acquisition will enable us to expand our distribution network and further grow this business segment 
risks beyond normal competition that may impact this segment include increased morbidity risk due to a weak economy that may increase disability claim costs  continued medical cost inflation that can put pressure on non medical benefit premium rates because employers may focus more on the employer s cost of non medical programs  and mortality risks including concentration risks from acts of terrorism not priced for or reinsured 
we mitigate these risks by monitoring new and existing claims and industry health care trend reports which serve as indicators of increased employer medical costs  through scrutiny of larger cases  especially renewals of groups with adverse experience  and through intensive review of our concentration risks 
one of our non core products  exec u care  which provides an insured medical expense reimbursement vehicle to executives for non covered health plan costs  produced revenues for this segment of approximately and net income of approximately in a discontinuation of exec u care  while not anticipated  would have a significant impact on segment revenues  but only a limited effect on net income

furthermore  our stations derived and of their advertising revenues from the automotive industry in and if automobile advertising is significantly curtailed  it could have a negative impact on broadcasting revenues 
in  of television revenues came from a network agreement with our cbs affiliated stations that expires in the trend in the industry is away from the networks compensating affiliates for carrying their programming  and there is a possibility those revenues will be eliminated when the contract is renewed 
radio and television stations require a license from the fcc to operate  with periodic renewal 
while management considers failure to renew remote  any station that fails to receive renewal would be forced to cease operations 
many different businesses compete for available advertising sales in our markets  including newspapers  magazines  billboards  and other radio and television broadcasters

this had the added benefit of creating taxable losses that we were able to carry back against previously paid income taxes 
bond impairments declined in as a result of significant improvement in the corporate credit environment and proactive portfolio management 
we reflect provisions for credit related losses in our estimated gross profits when calculating dac and voba amortization 
as reflected in the preceding table  we record dac and voba amortization on realized gains and losses on investments that back ul type products 
during the third quarter of  we recorded a dac unlocking of due to higher actual credit losses experienced over an economic cycle of several years than what we had assumed in our expected gross profits 
modeling of expected gross profits is discussed further in the dac and voba section that follows 
the following table summarizes assets assigned to this segment 
vs 
parent company  passive investment companies and corporate line assets of insurance subsidiaries unrealized gain on fixed interest investments co insurance receivables on acquired blocks employee benefit plan assets goodwill arising from insurance acquisitions other total total assets for the corporate and other segment increased as a result of improvement in the corporate credit environment  growth of our excess capital levels  and an increase of approximately in unrealized gains on equity securities 
we experienced a record level of bond impairments in due to the deterioration of the bond market as shown in the realized investment gains and losses table above 
risks for this segment include investment impairments due to continuing economic weakness or further economic decline  the risk of rising interest rates on our floating rate debt  the ability to replace existing debt agreements with comparable terms  declines in the values of our equity securities which would limit our potential for realized gains  general uncertainty regarding litigation  and the potential for future impairment of goodwill 
also  as discussed in the liquidity section  to service our debt and to pay shareholder dividends  we rely on excess cash flows through dividends from the insurance subsidiaries 
these dividends are dependent upon regulatory approval when above certain limits 
financial position our primary resources are investments related to our individual products  aip and benefit partners segments  properties and other assets utilized in all segments and investments backing corporate capital 
this section identifies several items on our balance sheet that are important to the overall understanding of our financial position 
the investments section reviews our investment portfolio and key portfolio management strategies 
total assets increased  in and  in due to net policyholder contract deposits  growth in dac  and unrealized gains on investments  which more than offset dividends  stock repurchases and impairment losses 
intangible assets on our balance sheet include dac  voba  goodwill and fcc licenses 
dac  voba and unearned revenue both dac and voba are amortized through expenses as revenues are recognized in the future 
some of the assumptions regarding future experience that can affect the carrying value of dac and voba balances include mortality  interest spreads  lapse rates and policy fees earned 
significant differences between actual experience and assumptions we use can impact the carrying balance of dac and voba and therefore produce changes that must be reflected in earnings 
these changes can be positive or negative 
our traditional individual and group insurance products are long duration contracts 
dac and voba related to these products are amortized in proportion to premium revenue recognized 
the dac and voba balances on these products were or of the gross balances before adjustments for unrealized gains and losses at december   and are generally subject to little volatility 
we amortize dac and voba on ul type products and annuity products relative to the future estimated gross profits egp over the life of these products 
in calculating the egp for these products  management must make assumptions regarding the following components estimates of fees charged to policyholders to cover mortality  surrenders and maintenance costs  estimated mortality in excess of fund balances accumulated  expected interest rate spreads between income earned  including default charges paid to the corporate and other segment  and amounts credited to policyholder accounts  and estimated costs of policy administration maintenance 
as mentioned earlier  certain ul type products sold in our individual products segment are designed with larger up front expense charges 
significant portions of these up front expense charges are deferred as unearned revenue reserves and are amortized into income over time using assumptions similar to those used for dac and voba 
the egp used in our dac and voba calculations include these up front expense charges net of the deferrals but exclude the related amortization 
dac and voba calculations are sensitive to changes in our assumptions regarding egp components  and any significant change in these assumptions will immediately impact the current dac and voba balances with the change reflected through the income statement 
we regularly review the models and the assumptions regarding egp used in the calculation of amortization expense for these products so that the assumptions reflect management s current view of future events 
we consider the following assumptions to be most significant to ul type products estimated mortality  estimated interest spreads  and estimated future policy lapses 
dac and voba on ul type products were  or of the gross balances at december  in addition to these three assumptions all ul type  vul and va products contain an additional assumption that affects the dac and voba amortization 
this critical assumption is the rate of growth of the separate account mutual funds that generate additional policy fees utilized in the egp on vul and va products 
we assume a long term total net return on separate account assets  including dividends and market value increases  of and a five year reversion period 
the reversion period is a period over which a short term return assumption is used to maintain the model s overall long term rate of return 
we cap the reversion rate of return at for one year and for years two through five 
the effect of this limitation is to reduce the cumulative effective long term rate 
the following table reflects the possible pretax income statement impacts that could occur in a given year if we change our assumptions as illustrated related to ul type products in the individual products segment one time effect on dac  voba and unearned revenue amortization favorable unfavorable quantitative change in significant assumptions change change estimated mortality improving degrading per year for years from the current estimate estimated interest spread increasing decreasing basis points per year for years from the current assumed spread estimated policy lapse rates decreasing increasing immediately and then increasing decreasing per year for years estimated long term rate of return from vul assets increasing decreasing using mean reversion techniques we consider estimated interest spreads and estimated future policy lapses to be the most significant assumptions related to our annuity products 
dac and voba on these products were or of the gross balances at december  the following table reflects the possible income statement impacts for our aip segment that could occur in a given year if we change our assumptions as illustrated related to annuity products one time effect on dac and voba amortization favorable unfavorable quantitative change in significant assumptions change change estimated interest spread increasing decreasing basis points per year for years from the current assumed spread estimated policy lapse rates decreasing increasing immediately and then increasing decreasing per year for years we also adjust the carrying value of dac and voba to reflect changes in the unrealized gains and losses in available for sale securities backing ul type and annuity products  since this impacts the timing of and possible realization of egp s 
note contains roll forwards of dac and voba including the amounts capitalized  amounts amortized and the effect of the unrealized gains 
goodwill goodwill was at december  and and and as a percentage of shareholders equity at these dates 
through december   goodwill was amortized on a straight line basis over periods of to years 
effective january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which primarily addresses the accounting for goodwill and intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition 
as a result  we regularly review the carrying amounts of these assets for indications of value impairment  considering financial performance and other relevant factors such as a significant adverse change in the business or legal climate  an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  or unanticipated competition 
if considered impaired  the carrying amounts would be written down to a value determined by using a combination of fair value and discounted cash flows 
absent an indication of impairment  we test goodwill for impairment annually in the month of june 
we concluded that there had been no impairments in or other at december  and  we had reinsurance receivables of and and policy loans of and which are related to the businesses of jp financial that are coinsured with household international hi affiliates 
hi has provided payment  performance and capital maintenance guarantees with respect to the balances receivable 
we regularly evaluate the financial condition of our reinsurers and monitor concentrations of credit risk related to reinsurance activities 
we have not suffered any significant credit losses from reinsurance activities in the last three years 
at december  and  the fair values of the assets related to the defined benefit pension plans were and the increase in assets reflects the improvement in the equity markets in which the majority of these assets are invested 
the projected benefit obligations at december  and were and with the majority of the growth due to actuarial losses that arose from a lower discount rate we used in the liability calculations for due to the declining interest rate environment 
net periodic benefit cost  which includes service cost  interest cost  return on plan assets and net amortization and deferrals of gains and losses  was an expense of for compared to income of for see note for further details regarding our pension plans 
capital resources at december   our capital structure consisted of short term commercial paper  securities sold under repurchase agreements  long term junior subordinated debentures  and stockholders equity 
we also have bank credit agreements for unsecured revolving credit  under which we have the option to borrow at various interest rates 
the two agreements currently aggregate with half available until may and half available until may the credit agreements principally support our issuance of commercial paper 
outstanding commercial paper has various maturities that can be up to days 
if we cannot remarket commercial paper at maturity  we have sufficient liquidity  consisting of the bank credit agreements  liquid assets  such as equity securities  and other resources to retire these obligations 
the weighted average interest rates for commercial paper borrowings outstanding of and at december  and were and 
the maximum amount outstanding during and was and our commercial paper is currently rated by two rating agencies 
agency rating fitch f standard poor s a these are both the highest ratings that the agencies issue and have been affirmed in the past six months 
a significant drop in these ratings  while not anticipated  could cause us to pay higher rates on commercial paper borrowings or lose access to the commercial paper market 
our insurance subsidiaries have sold collateralized mortgage obligations and agency debentures under repurchase agreements involving various counterparties  accounted for as financing arrangements with maturities less than six months 
we may use proceeds to purchase securities with longer durations as an asset liability management strategy 
at december  and  repurchase agreements  including accrued interest  were and the securities involved had a fair value and amortized cost of and at december  versus and at december  the maximum principal amounts outstanding were and during and under fin as described in note  effective december  we no longer consolidate two affiliated capital trusts that sold preferred capital securities in private placements and used the proceeds to purchase junior subordinated debentures from the company in the debentures pay interest semi annually and mature in or earlier  at our option  beginning in at december  and  the debentures outstanding were prior to the adoption of fin we reported of capital securities in the mezzanine equity section of our consolidated balance sheet 
on january   we issued of year term notes and of floating rate extendible liquidity securities exls with an initial maturity of february  subject to periodic extension through the proceeds from the debt issuance were used to finance the canada life acquisition and to pay down commercial paper while rebalancing the mix of fixed and floating rate debt and short and long term maturities in our capital structure 
we have received confirmation from both fitch and s p that the debt issuance will have no impact on our ratings or outlook 
stockholders equity increased in compared to in unrealized gains on available for sale securities  which are included as a component of stockholders equity  increased and in those years 
the remaining change in stockholders equity is due to net income  dividends to stockholders  and common share activity due to issuance of shares under our stock option plans and share repurchases 
our ratio of stockholders equity to assets excluding separate accounts was   and at december   and in we repurchased  of our common shares at an average cost of per share compared to  shares at an average cost of in in february  our board refreshed its share repurchase authorization to million shares 
our insurance subsidiaries have statutory surplus and risk based capital levels well above regulatory required levels 
these capital levels together with the rating agencies assessments of our business strategies have enabled our major life insurance affiliates to attain the following claims paying ratings jp life jpfic jpla am best a a a standard poor s aaa aaa aaa fitch ratings aa aa aa the ratings by am best and standard poor s are currently the highest available by those rating agencies and have been recently reaffirmed  while the ratings by fitch ratings is that agency s second highest rating 
a significant drop in our ratings  while not anticipated  could potentially impact future sales and or accelerate surrenders on our business in force 
liquidity we meet liquidity requirements primarily by positive cash flows from the operations of subsidiaries 
primary sources of cash from our insurance operations are premiums  other insurance considerations  receipts for policyholder accounts  investment sales and maturities and investment income 
primary uses of cash for our insurance operations include purchases of investments  payment of insurance benefits  operating expenses  withdrawals from policyholder accounts  costs related to acquiring new business  dividends and income taxes 
primary sources of cash from the communications operations are revenues from broadcast advertising  and primary uses include payments for commissions  compensation and related costs  sports rights  interest  income taxes and purchases of fixed assets 
cash provided by operations in  and was  and the primary drivers for the increase over were an increase in traditional product premium receipts in our benefit partners segment due to growth in that segment  combined with the timing of the processing of community banks and boli single premiums received in late  pending policy issuance which then occurred in those premiums were reported as cash received from operations in and as a decrease in cash from operations in net cash used in investing activities was   and  in  and the decrease in aip sales in provided less funds for investment purposes 
record sales levels in our individual products segment in increased funds available for investment 
net cash provided by financing activities was   and in  and  including cash inflows from policyholder contract deposits net of withdrawals of   and  the fluctuations in net policyholder contract deposits again reflect the lower aip sales  increased life sales in  combined with the processing of the premiums received in late net borrowings decreased in as borrowings were used in to fund investing activities as well as increased stock repurchases in that year 
in order to meet the parent company s dividend payments  debt servicing obligations and other expenses  we rely on dividends from our insurance subsidiaries 
cash dividends received from subsidiaries by the parent company were  and in  and our life insurance subsidiaries are subject to laws in their states of domicile that limit the amount of dividends that can be paid without the prior approval of the respective state s insurance regulator 
the limits are based in part on the prior year s statutory income and capital  which are negatively impacted by bond losses and write downs 
approval of these dividends will depend upon the circumstances at the time  but we have not experienced problems with state approvals in the past 
cash and cash equivalents were  and at december   and the decrease in reflects the year end build up of cash used to pay off the meds in january the parent company and non regulated subsidiaries held equity and fixed income securities of  and at these dates 
we consider the majority of these securities to be a source of liquidity to support our strategies 
total debt and equity securities available for sale at december  and were  and  contractual obligations the following table details our contractual obligations at december  payments due by period less than more than total year years years years debt purchase obligations total reverse repurchase agreements and external commercial paper represent debt due in less than one year 
the junior subordinated debentures mentioned earlier are the debt due in five years or more 
purchase obligations consist of jpcc commitments for purchases of syndicated television programming and commitments on other contracts and future sports programming rights of approximately as of december   payable through the year we have commitments to sell a portion of the sports programming rights to other entities for over the same period 
these commitments are not reflected as an asset or liability in our balance sheets because the programs are not currently available for use 
we expect advertising revenues that are sold on an annual basis to fund the purchase commitments 
our total policy liabilities also represent contractual obligations  where the timing of payments is unknown because it depends on insurable events or policyholder surrenders 
our asset liability management process  discussed further in market risk exposures  is designed to appropriately match our invested assets with the actuarially estimated timing of amounts payable to our policyholders 
off balance sheet arrangements and commitments we have no material off balance sheet arrangements of a financing nature 
we routinely enter into commitments to extend credit in the form of mortgage loans and to purchase certain debt instruments in private placement transactions for our investment portfolio 
the fair value of such outstanding commitments as of december  approximates these commitments will be funded through cash flows from operations and investment maturities during and are not included in contractual obligations listed above 
investments portfolio description our strategy for managing the investment portfolio of our insurance subsidiaries is to consistently meet pricing assumptions while appropriately managing credit risk 
we invest for the long term  and most of our investments are held until they mature 
our investment portfolio includes primarily fixed income securities and commercial mortgage loans 
the nature and quality of investments that our insurance subsidiaries hold must comply with state regulatory requirements 
we have established a formal investment policy  which describes our overall quality and diversification objectives and limits 
approximately of our portfolio has been designated as available for sale afs and is carried on the balance sheet at fair value 
we determine fair values of our securities  including securities not actively traded  using the methodology described in the critical accounting policies section above 
changes in fair values of afs securities are reflected in other comprehensive income 
the remainder of our portfolio has been designated as held to maturity htm 
as prescribed by generally accepted accounting principles  htm securities are carried at amortized cost  and accordingly there is a difference between fair value and carrying value for htm securities 
the following table shows the carrying values of our invested assets december december publicly issued bonds privately placed bonds total bonds redeemable preferred stock total debt securities mortgage loans on real property common stock non redeemable preferred stock policy loans real estate other cash and equivalents total unrealized gains and losses the majority of our unrealized gains and losses can be attributed to changes in interest rates and market changes in credit spreads

we manage this risk through a structured approach in which we assess the effects of the changing economic landscape 
we devote a significant amount of effort of both highly specialized  well trained internal resources and external experts in our approach to managing credit risk 
impairment review in identifying potentially distressed securities we first screen for all securities that have a fair value to amortized cost ratio of less than 
however  as part of this identification process  management must make assumptions and judgments using the following information current fair value of the security compared to amortized cost length of time the fair value was below amortized cost industry factors or conditions related to a geographic area that are negatively affecting the security downgrades by a rating agency past due interest or principal payments or other violation of covenants deterioration of the overall financial condition of the specific issuer in analyzing securities for other than temporary impairments  we then pay special attention to securities that have been potentially distressed for a period greater than six months 
we assume that  absent reliable contradictory evidence  a security that is potentially distressed for a continuous period greater than twelve months has incurred an other than temporary impairment 
such reliable contradictory evidence might include  among other factors  a liquidation analysis performed by our investment professionals and consultants  improving financial performance or valuation of underlying assets specifically pledged to support the credit 
when we identify a security as potentially impaired  we add it to our potentially distressed security list and determine if the impairment is other than temporary 
various committees comprised of senior management and investment analysts intensively review the potentially distressed security list to determine if a security is deemed to be other than temporarily impaired 
in this review  we consider the following criteria fundamental analysis of the liquidity and financial condition of the specific issuer underlying valuation of assets specifically pledged to support the credit time period in which the fair value has been significantly below amortized cost industry sector or geographic area applicable to the specific issuer our ability and intent to retain the investment for a sufficient time to recover its value when this intensive review determines that the decline is other than temporary based on management s judgment  the security is written down to fair value through a charge to realized investment gains and losses 
we adjust the amortized cost for both afs and htm securities that have experienced other than temporary impairments to reflect fair value at the time of the impairment 
we consider factors that lead to an other than temporary impairment of a particular security in order to determine whether these conditions have impacted other similar securities 
we monitor unrealized losses through further analysis according to maturity date  credit quality  individual creditor exposure and the length of time the individual security has continuously been in an unrealized loss position 
the following table shows the maturity date distribution of our debt securities in an unrealized loss position at december  the fair values of these securities could fluctuate over the respective periods to maturity or any sale

of this amount  had been continuously included in our potentially distressed securities list for more than twelve months 
information about unrealized gains and losses is subject to rapidly changing conditions 
securities with unrealized gains and losses will fluctuate  as will those securities that we have identified as potentially distressed 
the recent volatility of financial markets and declines in market interest rates has led to an increase in both unrealized gains and losses 
we consider all of the factors discussed earlier when we determine if an unrealized loss is other than temporary  including our ability and intent to hold the security until the value recovers 
however  we may subsequently decide to sell certain of these securities in future periods within the overall context of our portfolio management strategies 
if we make the decision to dispose of a security with an unrealized loss  we will write down the security to its fair value if we have not sold it by the end of the reporting period 
realized losses write downs and sales realized losses are comprised of both write downs on other than temporary impairments and actual sales of securities 
in we had other than temporary impairments on bonds of as compared to for the individual impairments in excess of  how they were measured  the circumstances giving rise to the losses  and the impact those circumstances have on other material investments we held at the time are as follows write down on debt of dairy holdings a subsidiary of parmalat 
this issuer defaulted on this security and subsequently filed for bankruptcy protection 
this is the only exposure we had to parmalat 
this security was sold for its written down value in this had no impact on other holdings in our portfolio 
write down related to airline equipment trusts that were secured by passenger aircraft 
given the overall softness in the us passenger airline industry  these securities became other than temporarily impaired 
we sold these bonds at their book value after this write down 
we have been actively managing all of our exposures to the passenger airline industry  although this had no impact on other holdings in our portfolio 
write down of us generating 
this was an investment in a project finance security in the power generating industry 
the lessee of this facility filed bankruptcy and rejected this lease 
as a result  the investment became other than temporarily impaired 
this had no impact on other holdings in our portfolio 
write down on preferred stock of a financial marketing firm 
the circumstances surrounding this other than temporary impairment do not impact any other securities in our portfolio 
write down of manufactured housing debt that was secured by long term mortgages on mobile homes and a corporate guarantee from the manufacturer and underwriter of the underlying collateral 
the manufacturer filed for chapter bankruptcy protection rendering the corporate guarantee essentially worthless 
in addition  we concluded that projected cash flows of the underlying collateral may be insufficient based on third party valuations 
this had no impact on other holdings in our portfolio 
write down of manufactured housing debt that was secured by long term mortgages on mobile homes and a corporate guarantee from the manufacturer and underwriter of the underlying collateral 
the manufacturer filed for chapter bankruptcy protection  which left us unable to collect under the corporate guarantee 
again  we concluded that projected cash flows of the underlying collateral may be insufficient based on third party valuations 
this had no impact on other holdings in our portfolio 
write down on debt of worldcom  inc  which filed for bankruptcy in july 
this issuer had specific problems with accounting restatements and potentially questionable business practices 
the entire telecommunications sector has been under pressure due to overcapacity 
we then sold these securities in we specifically looked at other creditors in this sector including several on our potentially distressed security list and determined that at this point  the unrealized losses on securities we hold of other material creditors are temporary 
write down related to united airlines equipment trust certificates 
this airline filed for chapter bankruptcy protection 
this had no impact on other holdings in our portfolio 
write down on debt of nrg energy that defaulted due to liquidity issues brought upon by rapid ratings downgrades 
we then sold these securities in the bulk of our holdings in the utilities sector are regulated utility bonds 
however  we did review our exposure to unregulated companies  whose bonds are typically lower rated and display greater risk profile than regulated companies 
in this review we did not identify any other write downs 
in  we incurred losses of on sales of securities 
there were no individually material losses on sales of securities in all disposals were in accordance with established portfolio management strategies and did not previously meet the criteria for other than temporary impairment 
mortgage backed securities mortgage backed securities including commercial mortgage backed securities at december  and  all of which are included in debt securities available for sale  were as follows federal agency issued mortgage backed securities corporate private labeled mortgage backed securities total our investment strategy with respect to mortgage backed securities mbs portfolio focuses on actively traded issues with less volatile cash flows 
the majority of the mbs holdings are sequential and planned amortization class tranches of federal agency issuers 
the mbs portfolio has been constructed with underlying mortgage collateral characteristics and structure in order to mitigate cash flow volatility over a range of interest rates 
because of the decline in interest rates during and early  the mortgage market experienced record levels of refinancings and the structural protection of our mbs portfolio eroded 
we experienced mbs prepayments totaling  or and  or of the average carrying value of the mbs portfolio in and our mbs portfolio is primarily a discount portfolio  therefore  prepayments accelerate the accretion of discount into income 
the excess accretion of discount increased investment income in by compared to in  on a pre tax basis 
prepayments were not material in these prepayments are reinvested at yields that are lower than our current portfolio yields  producing less investment income going forward 
as shown above  our mbs portfolio declined substantially in  and we reinvested most of the proceeds in investment grade corporate bonds 
mortgage loans we record mortgage loans on real property net of an allowance for credit losses 
this allowance includes both reserve amounts for specific loans  and a general reserve that is calculated by review of historical industry loan loss statistics 
we consider future cash flows and the probability of payment when we calculate our specific loan loss reserve 
see note for more detail regarding the composition and concentration of our mortgage loan portfolio 
derivative instruments our investment guidelines permit use of derivative financial instruments such as futures contracts and interest rate swaps in conjunction with specific direct investments 
our actual use of derivatives through december  has been limited to managing well defined interest rate risks 
interest rate swaps utilized in our asset liability management strategy with a current notional value of and were open as of december  and during  we began using interest rate swaps to hedge prospective bond purchases to back deposits on certain annuity contracts 
this hedging strategy protects the spread between the annuity crediting rate offered at the time the annuities are sold and the yield on bonds to be purchased to back those annuity contracts 
these interest rate swap contracts are generally terminated within a month 
we also purchase s p index options in conjunction with our sales of equity indexed annuities 
the reinsurance agreement on previously issued equity indexed annuities remains in force 
market risk exposures since our assets and liabilities are largely monetary in nature  our financial position and earnings are subject to risks resulting from changes in interest rates at varying maturities  changes in spreads over us treasuries on new investment opportunities  changes in the yield curve  and equity price risks 
during  year us treasury rates increased basis points from to 
in a falling interest rate environment  the risk of prepayment on some fixed income securities increases and funds prepaid are then reinvested at lower yields 
we limit this risk by concentrating the fixed income portfolio mainly on non callable securities  by selecting mbs s that are structured to minimize cash flow volatility and by purchasing securities that provide for make whole type prepayment fees 
falling interest rates can also impact demand for our products  as bank certificates of deposit with no surrender charges and higher average returns from equity markets may become more attractive to new and existing customers 
conversely  in a rising interest rate environment  competitive pressures may make it difficult for us to sustain spreads between rates we credit on interest sensitive products and our portfolio earnings rates  thereby prompting withdrawals by policyholders 
we manage these risks by adjusting our interest crediting rates with due regard to the yield of our investment portfolio  minimum rate guarantees and pricing assumptions and by prudently managing interest rate risk of assets and liabilities 
as is typical in the industry  our life and annuity products contain minimum rate guarantees regarding interest we credit 
for interest sensitive life products  our minimum rates range from to  with an approximate weighted average of 
for annuity products  our minimum rates range from to  with an approximate weighted average of 
we employ various methodologies to manage our exposure to interest rate risks 
our asset liability management process focuses primarily on the management of interest rate risk of our insurance operations 
we monitor the duration of insurance liabilities compared to the duration of assets backing the insurance lines  measuring the optionality of cash flows 
our goal in this analysis is to prudently balance profitability and risk for each insurance product category  and for us as a whole 
at december  and  of policy liabilities related to interest sensitive portfolios 
we also consider the timing of cash flows arising from market risk sensitive instruments and insurance portfolios under varying interest rate scenarios as well as the related impact on reported earnings under those varying scenarios 
market risk sensitive instruments include debt and equity securities available for sale and held to maturity including mbs securities  mortgage loans  policy loans  investment commitments  annuities in the accumulation phase and periodic payment annuities  commercial paper borrowings  repurchase agreements and interest rate swaps 
we have derived the estimated incremental loss amounts below by modeling estimated cash flows of our market risk sensitive instruments and insurance portfolios 
incremental income or loss is net of taxes at 
the model also assumes that all floating rate debt  including reverse repurchase agreements  is replaced with similar instruments 
estimated cash flows produced in the model assume reinvestments representative of our current investment strategy  and calls prepayments include scheduled maturities as well as those expected to occur when borrowers can benefit financially based on the difference between prepayment penalties and new money rates under each scenario 
assumed lapse rates within insurance portfolios consider the relationships expected between crediting rates and market interest rates  as well as the level of surrender charges inherent in individual contracts 
the illustrated incremental income or loss also includes the expected impact on amortization of dac and voba 
the model is based on our existing business in force as of december  and does not consider new sales of life and annuity products or the potential impact of interest rate fluctuations on sales 
the following table shows our estimate of the impact that various hypothetical interest rate scenarios would have on our earnings for a single year  based on the assumptions in our model 
we believe that  based upon historically low current interest rates  a symmetrical change in interest rates is not reasonably possible 
our model shows the effect on income with an increase of up to basis points and a decrease of basis points 
we believe that the basis point increase or basis point decrease  graded pro rata over four quarters  reflects reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates as of december  the incremental loss for a year derives primarily from differences in the yield curves and in the sensitivities they introduce to our model 
these estimated impacts are incremental to potential earnings impacts from trends and or environmental factors already in existence  such as an expected reduction in the level of prepayments on mortgage backed securities 
the model assumes that changes in our crediting rates will occur correspondingly with increases or declines in investment yields  subject to the impact of minimum rate guarantees 
as discussed previously  as of year end our crediting rates on blocks of business that are on an annual reset basis were approximately basis points and basis points on average in excess of minimum guaranteed rates for individual products and aip 
the table reflects the effect of the interest rate scenarios on one year s reportable segment results 
a spike in interest rates of basis points that lasts for three years would produce a significantly larger estimated loss in the second and third years  as policyholders would potentially seek more attractive rates elsewhere 
correspond ingly  a basis point decrease would cause a significantly larger estimated loss in the second and third years  as minimum rate guarantees would prohibit us from lowering credited rates on most products 
estimated incremental change in interest rate single year loss basis points basis points basis points basis points generally  an increase in interest rates will benefit our earnings in the insurance portfolio  yet increase our interest expense on floating rate debt 
conversely  a decrease in interest rates will decrease earnings from the insurance portfolio as minimum rate guarantees have more of an effect and or competitive conditions would not permit us to reduce crediting rates  while we would benefit from the decline in interest expense on our floating rate debt 
the incremental income or loss for shifts in excess of those shown or that occur more quickly than quarterly grading does not have a linear relationship to the values shown above 
the incremental loss resulting from a higher change in interest rates would be proportionally greater due to the optionality of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities 
similarly  the incremental loss resulting from a greater decrease in interest rates would be proportionally greater due to the effect of minimum rate guarantees in our interest sensitive liabilities 
a significant change in the slope of the yield curve could also affect our results 
for example  competing products such as bank cds could become relatively more attractive than our longer duration annuities under an inverted yield curve  resulting in higher policyholder withdrawals 
an anticipated increase in interest rates could also suggest that we would term out more of our floating rate debt  which the model does not take into consideration 
we are exposed to equity price risk on our equity securities other than trading 
we hold common stock with a fair value of  approximately is in a single issuer  bank of america corporation bankamerica 
we believe that a hypothetical decline in the equity market is possible 
if the market value of the s p index  and of bankamerica common stock specifically  decreased  the fair value of our common stock as of december  would change as follows hypothetical change in fair value from market decline bankamerica common stock other equity securities total change in fair values certain fixed interest rate market risk sensitive instruments may not give rise to incremental income or loss during the period illustrated  but may be subject to changes in fair values which are reflected in equity

external trends and forward looking information we operate within the united states financial services and broadcasting markets  which are both subject to general economic conditions 
interest rates on longer maturity debt instruments continued to drop dramatically in and early additional changes in rates may affect our businesses in many ways as discussed earlier in the market risk exposure section 
as noted in the investment section  the prolonged decline in general economic conditions has increased our credit risk 
a prolonged period of further declining or even level interest rates in their current position would have an impact on our individual and aip segments 
investments purchased for those segments yielding rates lower than our current portfolio rates will lower our overall portfolio earned rates 
in the individual and aip segments  there are minimum crediting rates on policyholder accounts inherent in the insurance portfolio due to both product guarantees and various state requirements 
our inability to reduce crediting rates in response to the declines in earned rates would result in a significant negative impact on future earnings 
furthermore  a continued general economic weakness would cause deterioration in our balance sheet and our overall future profitability 
our operations are also affected over the longer term by demographic shifts  global markets  technological innovation and overall capital market volatility 
these forces impact us in various ways such as demand for our insurance products and advertising revenues  competition from other financial services providers  competition from emerging technologies for television and radio advertising  competition for new investments  debt costs  mergers and consolidations within the financial services and communications sectors  and costs inherent in administering complex financial products 
demographic changes include the aging of the baby boomers  reaching their high earning years at a time when investment yields from fixed rate products are at historically low points 
this challenge has been met by the insurance industry by offering various types of fixed and variable products aimed at this population 
the industry s overall individual life insurance sales in the us were flat in and  until late in the year  reflected a trend towards those financial products with a fixed rate given the volatility in the equity markets 
regulatory and legal environment the us insurance industry has experienced mergers  acquisitions  consolidations  sales of business lines and marketing arrangements with other financial services providers 
these activities have been driven by a need to reduce costs of distribution and to increase economies of scale in the face of growing competition from larger insurers  banks  securities brokers  mutual funds and other non traditional competitors 
we expect further strategic alignments in the financial services industry given changing demographics  technological advances  and customer expectations for one stop shopping 
we continue to analyze our options within this environment for increasing distribution  adding products and technology and improving economies of scale 
state guaranty associations make assessments to cover losses to policyholders of insolvent or rehabilitated insurance companies 
assessments may be partially recovered through a reduction in future premium taxes in most states 
we have accrued for expected assessments net of estimated future premium tax deductions

environmental liabilities we are exposed to environmental regulation and litigation as a result of ownership of investment real estate and real estate owned by jpcc 
our actual loss experience has been minimal and we consider our exposure to environmental losses to be insignificant
