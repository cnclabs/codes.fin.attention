material sciences corporation msc or company reports segment information based on how management disaggregates its businesses for evaluating performance and making operating decisions 
msc reports results on the basis of two business segments  msc engineered materials and solutions group ems and msc electronic materials and devices group emd 
ems s electronic material based solutions consist primarily of coated metal and laminated noise reducing materials used in the electronics market 
ems s acoustical thermal material based solutions consist of layers of metal and other materials used to manage noise and thermal energy for the automotive  lighting and appliance markets 
ems s coated metal material based solutions include coil coated and electrogalvanized eg products primarily used in the automotive  building and construction  appliance and lighting markets 
emd s electronic material based solutions include field effect technology for sensors  switches and interface solutions in the consumer electronics and transportation markets 
as a result of the sale of substantially all of the assets of the company s specialty films segment  including msc specialty films  inc msc sfi  to bekaert corporation and its affiliates bekaert in the second quarter of fiscal  and the sale of substantially all of the assets of the company s pinole point steel business  including msc pinole point steel inc and msc pre finish metals pp inc  to grupo imsa sa de sa imsa and other third parties in the first quarter of fiscal  both specialty films and pinole point steel are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented

overcapacity in the coil coating industry is approximately which has an impact on pricing  facility utilization and the need for competitive terms of sale 
in addition  the domestic steel industry has suffered numerous bankruptcies and strong international competition 
table of contents which has impacted the company s eg business and the availability and cost of steel substrate 
however  there are significant growth opportunities for the company s noise  vibration and harshness nvh solutions in the acoustical thermal and electronic markets served 
we also believe that the future opportunities for emd s field effect technology are significant  as exhibited by the recent commercial successes with lear corporation lear and in the recreational vehicle and marine markets 
during fiscal  management executed an action plan to make systemic cost reductions  initiate organizational changes designed to provide focus on operations  evaluate the strategic direction of the company and its portfolio of operations  and perform a review of underperforming assets with the intent of improving performance  selling or idling those underperforming assets 
during the fiscal year  the company benefited from approximately  of cost savings including both cost of sales and sg a cost reductions 
these cost savings were due to the company s production efficiencies  workforce reductions and reductions in benefit costs  including the reduction of  in retiree health care liability in the second fiscal quarter  and other reductions in discretionary spending 
the company made certain organizational changes in fiscal  impacting the company s marketing and manufacturing operations 
the last changes were made in may the primary emphasis of these actions was to focus appropriate resources on the coil coating markets to increase sales and reduce costs 
in the growth area of the business  primarily quiet steel products  the company continues to invest in marketing and manufacturing facilities to commercialize its laminate products 
these efforts were rewarded with key product wins including the ford f dash panel and oil pan  and the recessed floor pans for the stow n go seat in the new chrysler town country and dodge grand caravan minivans 
in may  the company announced the addition of a center of excellence coe which will be utilized for the engineering  application and validation of its nvh material solutions 
in connection with its strategic review process  the company announced the sale of its idled elk grove village production line in january  and entered into a letter of intent for the sale of the elk grove village production facility housing the idled line 
in addition  the company entered into retention agreements with key employees to ensure continuity of business operations 
a significant portion of the retention benefits vest on may  the company also entered into agreements to buyout legacy costs related to certain supplemental pension benefits serp with officers and key employees 
as a result of the strategic review and fourth quarter events industry wide metal shortages  higher metal pricing and the loss of a significant customer serviced by the middletown  ohio facility  the company announced the closing of the middletown facility in may the board concluded that operating the remaining coil coating facilities would provide the best opportunity for a greater return to shareowners 
this resulted in a pretax impairment charge of  in the fourth quarter of fiscal the company also evaluated the goodwill related to its fiscal acquisition of goldbach automobil consulting gac in the fourth quarter in accordance with its accounting policy to review goodwill for impairment on an annual basis 
the penetration of the european brake market was slower than previously projected 
in addition  the company experienced delays in the negotiation of definitive agreements with a potential strategic partner related to the marketing and sales of quiet steel in europe 
based on these factors  the company recorded a pretax impairment charge of  the company is reviewing various strategic alliances  including joint ventures  to commercialize these products in europe 
however  we cannot be certain of the success of these efforts 
the company is also reviewing the continued investment in the emd business segment 
we believe that the field effect technology has significant value indicated by the acceptance of the technology in several areas including the automotive market execution of an exclusive supply agreement with lear  the non automotive transportation market products in the recreational vehicle and marine and the consumer electronics market 
the company is currently discussing a full range of strategic alternatives as it relates to the emd business 
the company believes that this process will accelerate the market penetration of the technology

long lived assets 
long lived assets consist of property  plant and equipment and are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable based on projections of cash flows on a non discounted basis 
if the fair value is less than the carrying amount of the asset  a loss is recognized for the difference 
fair value is determined based on market quotes  if available  or is based on valuation techniques  such as discounted cash flows 
the valuation techniques utilize certain assumptions made by the company including  but not limited to  
table of contents estimated fair market value of assets  which are based on additional assumptions such as public market data  depreciation factors for orderly liquidation  including allowances such as dismantlement and removal  and the relationship between replacement cost new and market value based on the age of the assets 
goodwill 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
with the adoption of sfas no 
on march   goodwill will no longer be subject to amortization over its estimated useful life

this test requires that the company estimate the fair value of its goodwill and compare that estimate to the amount of goodwill recorded on the consolidated balance sheet 
the estimation of fair value requires that the company make judgments concerning future cash flows and appropriate discount rates 
the estimate of the fair value of goodwill could change over time based on a variety of factors  including the actual operating performance of the relevant portion of the business see note  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements entitled  summary of significant accounting policies goodwill on pages and 
income taxes 
the provision for income taxes is determined under the liability method pursuant to sfas no

plan assets  which consist primarily of marketable equity and debt instruments  are valued using market quotations 
plan obligations and the annual pension expense are determined by consulting actuaries using a number of assumptions 
key assumptions in measuring the plan obligations include the discount rate at which the obligation could be effectively settled and the anticipated rate of future salary increases 
key assumptions in the determination of the annual pension expense include the discount rate  the rate of salary increases and the estimated future return on plan assets 
to the extent actual amounts differ from these assumptions and estimated amounts  results could be adversely affected
