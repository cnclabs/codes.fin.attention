overview the company is focused exclusively on providing a superior experience to over  students through the leading global network of accredited campus based and online higher education institutions 
on june   the company sold the principal operations comprising its k segments k segment and sold certain investments in sylvan ventures that are not strategic to its post secondary education business in a transaction more fully described in note of the consolidated financial statements 
in connection with these transactions  the company realigned its business segments 
the company s educational services are offered through two separate business segments campus based and online higher education segments 
the campus based segment owns or maintains controlling interests in nine separately accredited higher education institutions with locations in mexico  chile  spain  switzerland  france  ecuador  panama and costa rica 
the online higher education segment provides career oriented degree programs to over  students through canter  walden  and ntu 
sale of business units on june   the company completed the sale to educate  inc educate  a newly formed company by apollo  of substantially all of its k segment principal k disposal group 
in addition  during the second quarter of  management committed to a plan to dispose of its wsi business 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding these transactions 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s accounting policies are more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
as disclosed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates  and these differences may be material to the financial statements 
the company believes the following key accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements and are critical to its business operations and the understanding of its results of operations 
revenue recognition 
revenues from educational services  tuition and fees  are recorded on a straight line basis over the length of period in which services are provided 
textbook sales and the related cost of the textbooks are recognized at the beginning of each academic quarter with respect to students who are attending courses in which textbooks are charged separately from tuition 
approximately of the company s revenues represent tuition charges and approximately of revenues represent bookstore sales and student fees 
for each student  billings issued or payments received in excess of tuition earned are recorded as deferred revenue 
refunds to students have been immaterial and generally limited to amounts paid for which educational services have not been rendered 
since the company does not recognize revenues until the services have been rendered  these refunds are charged to the deferred revenue account 
the amount of tuition earned depends on the fee per semester or per credit hour of the courses  how many program courses a student takes during each period of enrollment  and the total number of students enrolled in each program 
each of these factors is known at the time our tuition revenues are calculated and is not subject to estimation 
if the company were to add additional fees related to educational services  the fees would need to be assessed for proper revenue recognition treatment 
revenue from the sale of educational products is generally recognized when shipped and collectibility is reasonably assured 
accounts and notes receivable 
the company routinely makes estimates of the collectibility of its accounts and notes receivable 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
the company estimates the amount of the required allowance by reviewing the status of past due receivables and analyzing historical bad debt trends 
actual collection experience has not varied significantly from estimates  due primarily to credit policies  and a lack of concentration of accounts receivable 
if the financial condition of students were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make required payments for tuition  additional allowances may be required 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
during each of the years presented  the company acquired various businesses accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
a portion of the purchase prices for these businesses was allocated to identifiable tangible and intangible assets and assumed liabilities based on estimated fair values at the dates of acquisitions 
any excess purchase price was allocated to goodwill 
this goodwill and other indefinite lived intangibles are evaluated at least annually for impairment 
goodwill is considered impaired when the carrying amount of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  as determined under a two step approach 
the first step is to determine the estimated fair value of each reporting unit with goodwill 
the reporting units of the company for purposes of the impairment test are those components of operating segments for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component 
components are combined when determining reporting units if they have similar economic characteristics 
because the company manages its campus based segment geographically  the reporting units for this segment are also geographic components of this operating segment 
the online higher education segment is one reporting unit for purposes of the impairment tests 
the company estimates the fair value of each reporting unit by estimating the present value of the reporting unit s future cash flows 
if the recorded net assets of the reporting unit are less than the reporting unit s estimated fair value  then no impairment is indicated 
alternatively  if the recorded net assets of the reporting unit exceed its estimated fair value  then goodwill is assumed to be impaired and a second step is performed 
in the second step  the implied fair value of the goodwill is determined by deducting the estimated fair value of all tangible and identifiable intangible net assets of the reporting unit from the estimated fair value of the reporting unit 
if the recorded amount of goodwill exceeds this implied fair value  an impairment charge is recorded for the excess 
other intangible assets include acquired student rosters  accreditation  tradenames  non competition agreements and curriculum 
the assumptions used to calculate the initial fair value of these identified intangible assets included estimates of future operating results and cash flows  as well as discount rates and weighted average cost of capital for each acquisition 
the assigned useful lives  which range from to years  are based upon estimated matriculation rates and other factors 
if the company used different assumptions and estimates in the calculation of the initial fair value of identified intangible assets and the estimation of the related useful lives  the amounts allocated to these assets  as well as the related amortization expense  could have been significantly different than the amounts recorded 
in assessing the recoverability of the company s goodwill and other intangible assets  the company must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded 
income taxes 
the company earns a significant portion of its income from subsidiaries located in countries outside of the united states 
at december   undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries totaled approximately million 
deferred tax liabilities have not been recognized for these undistributed earnings because it is management s intention to reinvest such undistributed earnings outside of the united states 
apb opinion no 
 accounting for income taxes special areas  requires that a company evaluate its circumstances to determine whether or not there is sufficient evidence to support the assertion that it has or will reinvest undistributed foreign earnings indefinitely 
the company s assertion that earnings from its foreign operations will be permanently reinvested is supported by projected working capital and long term capital needs in each subsidiary location in which the earnings are generated 
additionally  the company believes that it has the ability to permanently reinvest foreign earnings based on a review of projected cash flows from domestic operations  projected working capital and liquidity for both short term and long term domestic needs  and the expected availability of debt or equity markets to provide funds for those domestic needs 
if circumstances change and it becomes apparent that some or all of the undistributed earnings of the company s foreign subsidiaries will be remitted to the united states in the foreseeable future  the company will be required to recognize deferred tax liabilities on those amounts 
as of december   if all undistributed earnings had been remitted to the united states  the amount of incremental us federal income tax liabilities  net of foreign tax credits  would have been approximately million  of which million is related to discontinued operations 
the company has generated significant deferred tax assets  primarily as a result of its equity in the net losses of affiliated companies 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that it believes is more likely than not to be realized 
the primary factor used by the company to determine the amount of valuation allowance needed to offset deferred tax assets related to these losses is that when realized  these capital losses may be carried back to offset the company s substantial prior year capital gains  subject to certain limitations 
the company also has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the amount of valuation allowance needed 
if the company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should the company determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made 
results of operations sylvan s two continuing business segments generate revenues as follows campus based earns tuition and related fees paid by the students of the company s campus based higher education institutions 
online higher education earns revenues from instructional services that are provided through an online format  as well as other forms of distance learning 
the campus based and online higher education segments when presenting aggregated statements of operations data are referred to as core operating segments 
enrollments management closely follows trends in new and total enrollment because total enrollment growth is highly correlated with revenue growth 
new enrollments are particularly important as they impact future results 
enrollment reporting each of the higher education institutions has a different enrollment cycle depending on geography and academic program 
each higher education institution has a primary enrollment cycle at the start of each academic year  during which most of the enrollment occurs 
the first quarter coincides with the primary enrollment cycle for the company s higher education institutions in the chile region 
the third quarter coincides with the primary enrollment cycle for the company s higher education institutions in the mexico region  as well as higher education institutions in spain  switzerland  us and france 
the timing of the higher education institutions primary enrollment cycles impacts the seasonality of the business 
seasonality most of the higher education institutions have a summer break when classes are generally not in session  during which minimal revenues are recognized 
operating expenses  however  do not fully correlate to our enrollment and revenue cycles as the higher education institutions continue to incur fixed expenses during summer breaks 
as a result  the fourth quarter is the strongest quarter because all of the higher education institutions are in session 
the second quarter is also seasonally strong as all higher education institutions have classes in session  however  the company s largest university  located in mexico  is in session for only part of the quarter 
the first and third quarters are weaker quarters because the four largest higher education institutions have summer breaks for some portion of those quarters 
due to the seasonality  revenues and profits in any period are not necessarily indicative of results in subsequent periods 
the following chart shows the enrollment cycles for each higher education institution 
in the chart  shaded areas represent periods when classes are generally in session and revenues are recognized 
areas that are not shaded represent summer breaks during which revenues are not typically recognized 
the large circles indicate the primary enrollment start dates of the company s higher education institutions  and the small circles represent secondary enrollment start dates smaller intake cycles

student attrition management defines attrition as those students that leave the higher education institution prior to graduation 
attrition may be due to academic  financial or other personal reasons 
management closely monitors attrition levels at its higher education institutions 
to address the key reasons for student attrition  management has implemented programs  such as assistance with financing  remedial educational programs  mentoring and counseling 
in general  attrition at the higher education institutions has been stable as a percentage of total revenue over the past five years 
historically  attrition rates have not changed materially from year to year 
average length of stay management actively monitors the average length of stay of students 
the average length of stay is defined as the average time necessary to complete a given course of study  adjusted for attrition 
management believes that the company s year average length of stay and low attrition levels contribute to the predictability of future revenues 
due to the company s multi year average length of stay  historically changes in enrollment from one cycle to the next have not materially impacted quarterly or annual results 
pricing each higher education institution has different pricing based upon local demand level  economic conditions  and competitive environment 
increases in tuition have historically exceeded local market inflation 
foreign exchange all of the higher education institutions in the campus based segment are located outside the unites states 
therefore  management actively monitors the impact of foreign currency movements and the correlation between the local currency and the us dollar 
our diversified portfolio of currencies has mitigated the impact of translation risk based on currency movements 
since all of our revenues and expenses in a particular country are denominated in the local currency  our exposure is limited to the operating margin of our higher education institutions in that country 
also  since the company has historically reinvested each higher education institution s cash flow locally  our principal exposure is the translation risk into us dollars for purposes of our financial statements  as required by us gaap 
currently  the mexican peso is our largest currency  followed by the chilean peso  us dollar  euro and swiss franc  respectively

interest expense increased million primarily due to debt assumed in the august glion acquisition and incurred in the may unab acquisition 
income taxes 
the company has operations in multiple countries  many of which have statutory tax rates lower than the united states 
since approximately of the company s revenues are generated outside the united states  the impact of lower foreign tax rates in the jurisdictions where the company operates results in an effective tax rate significantly lower than the united states statutory rate as outlined in note to the consolidated financial statements 
comparison of results for the year ended december  to results for the year ended december  revenues

included in the fiscal expenses was the write off of million of deferred costs related to the terminated initial public offering of the campus based segment and one terminated acquisition 
excluding these charges  campus based expenses represented of campus based revenues for the fiscal year 
the decrease in expenses as a percentage of revenue is primarily due to operating efficiencies achieved throughout the campus based segment  particularly at udla  uem  and uvm 
online higher education expenses increased by million to million  or of online higher education revenue for the fiscal year  compared to million  or of online higher education revenue for the fiscal year 
approximately million of this increase was due to the acquisitions of walden in february and ntu in november canter had a decrease in expenses as a percentage of revenue for the year primarily due to the adoption of statement no 
in  which discontinued the amortization of goodwill 
the amortization of goodwill related to the canter acquisition was million in the fiscal year 
this decrease in canter s expenses as a percentage of its revenue was partially offset by an increase in expenses as a percentage of revenue due to the inclusion of the operating results of onlinelearning 
net in the fiscal year

core operating general and administrative expenses decreased to of core operating revenues in the fiscal year compared to of revenues in the fiscal year due to strong revenue expansion combined with cost controls 
sylvan ventures general and administrative expenses decreased by million to million for the fiscal year compared to million for the fiscal year 
the decrease was due to significant reduction in labor  travel and consulting costs associated with the research  evaluation and acquisition of new investment opportunities as management shifted its focus towards solely managing and reinvesting in its current investment portfolio

investment losses totaled million in the fiscal year compared to million in the fiscal year 
the fiscal year loss on investments was primarily due to million related to the write off of the company s investment in and advances to the frontline group 
this investment write off was a result of challenges facing the corporate training industry in general  and frontline group specifically 
the company originally accepted shares of common stock in frontline group as consideration for the sale of the pace business unit in the loss on investment was related to the company s investment in caliber 
the company recorded a loss on investment of million in the fiscal year  consisting of bad debt expense for uncollected notes receivable and advances to caliber of million  as well as the accrual of a million estimated liability relating to the company s guarantee of certain non cancelable caliber lease obligations and other caliber related liabilities incurred by the company 
in  the company recorded an additional million of liabilities related to caliber lease guarantees 
due to the uncertainties surrounding the bankruptcy proceedings and the ultimate settlement of caliber s lease and other liabilities  it is possible that the company s loss estimate may change prior to finalization 
the reduction in investment loss was partially offset by a decrease of investment and other income of million resulting from lower investment balances and a reduced interest rate environment equity in net income loss of affiliates 
sylvan ventures equity in net losses of affiliates  net of income taxes  decreased to million for the fiscal year from million for the fiscal year 
these losses relate to sylvan ventures share of operating losses generated by the early stage enterprises in the investment portfolio not under sylvan ventures control 
this decrease was primarily due to sylvan ventures change in strategy to focus on managing its current investments rather than investing in new early stage enterprises  as well as the consolidation of walden and edverify 
the reduction in the number of early stage enterprises and the decision of certain portfolio companies to cease operations slowed the losses absorbed by sylvan ventures  as these companies initially generate significant losses 
additionally  a number of the enterprises in which sylvan ventures invested throughout and have matured  and thus are generating reduced losses  relative to their earlier stages in the fiscal year 
in addition  in fiscal  the sylvan ventures investment in caliber of million was reduced to upon recording its allocable share of losses related to caliber prior to the bankruptcy proceedings  which is included in sylvan ventures equity in net loss of affiliates

also resulted in sylvan ventures no longer amortizing goodwill associated with equity method investments 
the amortization of goodwill related to the sylvan ventures equity investments in the fiscal year was million 
income taxes 
the company has operations in multiple countries  many of which have statutory tax rates lower than the united states 
since approximately of the company s revenues are generated outside the united states  the impact of lower foreign tax rates in the jurisdictions where the company operates results in an effective rate significantly lower than the united states statutory rate as outlined in note to the consolidated financial statements 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
as a result of adopting statement no 
as of january  and performing the required transitional impairment tests  the company recorded a non cash charge of million  net of income tax benefit of million  which was included in cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in the consolidated statements of operations 
the impairment charge related solely to wsi 
liquidity and capital resources the company generates revenue from tuition and other fees charged to students in connection with its various education program offerings 
students typically self finance the costs of their education or seek third party sponsored financing programs 
tuition is generally collected in advance 
as such  working capital is generally a source rather than use of funds 
given the favorable cash flow characteristics of the company s post secondary business  sylvan anticipates generating sufficient cash flow from operations within each of the individual countries where we operate to satisfy the working capital and financing needs of the company s organic growth plan of each respective country 
accordingly  liquidity is managed locally with oversight provided by corporate staff in baltimore  maryland 
the company incurs significant costs at its headquarters location in baltimore  maryland relating to meeting us and group corporate governance  reporting and compliance requirements  stewardship and financing of its ownership in investments and subsidiaries  and development of group synergies among its investments and subsidiaries 
cash flow from operations generated by the company s domestic businesses included within online higher education  coupled with incremental borrowing capacity  are expected to be sufficient to meet future working capital  financing and investment needs 
the following table presents the condensed statement of cash flows for the year ended december  for segregated for core operating segments and sylvan ventures activity 
the company is disbanding sylvan ventures 
the following table illustrates the uses of cash by sylvan ventures during the year ended december  management does not believe that the operations of sylvan ventures will be a significant use of cash in core operating segments sylvan ventures consolidated in thousands operating activities net income loss adjustments to reconcile net income loss to net cash provided by used in operating activities depreciation and amortization loss on ventures investments held for sale gain on disposal of discontinued operations non cash compensation other non cash items changes in working capital net cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities purchases of property and equipment proceeds from sale of principal k disposal group and fixed assets cash paid for acquired businesses  net of cash received other investing activities  net net cash used in investing activities financing activities net cash received from minority members of sylvan ventures intercompany funding other financing activities  net net cash used in provided by financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash net decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year cash and cash equivalents at end of year cash and cash equivalents classified as continuing operations discontinued operations cash and cash equivalents at end of period year during  cash provided by operations was million  net of cash used by operations of sylvan ventures of million

working capital decreased liquidity by million  primarily due to core operating segments 
this use of cash consisted primarily of a decrease in income taxes payable of million related to payments of income taxes on the gain from the sale of the principal k disposal group partially offset by decreases in inventory  prepaid expenses and other current assets and increased accounts payable and accrued expenses 
cash used by investing activities was million in the fiscal year  including cash used by sylvan ventures of million 
this compares to cash used by investing activities of million in the fiscal year including cash used by sylvan ventures of million 
the investment activity was primarily the result of net proceeds from the sale of available for sale securities of million and net proceeds from the sale of discontinued operations of million partially offset by cash paid for acquisitions of million  purchases of property  plant and equipment of million  and expenditures for deferred contract costs and increases in other long term assets of million

the fiscal year financing activity related primarily to net capital contributions from the minority interest members of sylvan ventures of million  proceeds from the exercise of options of million and increases in other long term liabilities of million 
the company anticipates that cash flow from operations  available cash and existing credit facilities will be sufficient to meet its operating requirements  including expansion of its existing business  funding campus based higher education institution acquisitions  and payment of contingent consideration 
the company continues to examine opportunities in the educational services industry for potential synergistic acquisitions 
sylvan expects that existing capital resources including credit facilities will be sufficient to continue to acquire businesses in the educational services industry for at least the next several years 
however  if the company were to pursue a number of large acquisitions  additional debt or equity capital may be required 
the company cannot be certain that this capital would be available on attractive terms  if at all 
the amount of capitalized costs incurred in connection with potential acquisitions and greenfield projects was million at december  these costs become part of the purchase price when the acquisition is completed or are expensed when the potential acquisition does not materialize

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss to future earnings  to fair values or to future cash flows that may result from the changes in the price of financial instruments 
the company is exposed to financial market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates  equity prices and investment values 
the company occasionally uses derivative financial instruments to protect against adverse currency movements related to significant foreign acquisitions 
exposure to market risks related to operating activities is managed through the company s regular operating and financing activities 
foreign currency risk the company derives approximately of its revenues from customers outside the united states 
this business is transacted through a network of international subsidiaries  generally in the local currency that is considered the functional currency of that foreign subsidiary 
expenses are also incurred in the foreign currencies to match revenues earned and minimize the company s exchange rate exposure to operating margins 
a hypothetical adverse change in average annual foreign currency exchange rates would have decreased operating income and decreased cash flows for the fiscal year by million 
the company generally views its investment in most of its foreign subsidiaries as long term 
the effects of a change in foreign currency exchange rates on the company s net investment in foreign subsidiaries are reflected in other comprehensive income loss 
a depreciation in functional currencies relative to the us dollar would have resulted in a decrease in the company s net investment in foreign subsidiaries of approximately million at december  interest rate risk the company holds its cash and cash equivalents in high quality  short term  fixed income securities

the company typically does not attempt to reduce or eliminate its market exposure on these securities 
a adverse change in equity prices would not materially impact the fair value of the company s marketable securities or other comprehensive income loss 
investment risk the company s investment portfolio includes debt securities that mature within one year 
a hypothetical adverse change in the fair value of the debt securities would not materially adversely impact earnings or cash flows because of the company s ability to hold the debt securities until maturity 
in addition to the debt securities  the company has an investment portfolio that includes short term investments in available for sale debt and equity securities 
the company s investment portfolio is exposed to risks arising from changes in these investment values 
all the potential impacts noted above are based on sensitivity analysis performed on the company s financial position at december  actual results may differ materially
