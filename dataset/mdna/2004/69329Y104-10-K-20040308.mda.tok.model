overview we are a recognized leader in the discovery and development of humanized monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of disease 
all of our revenues are derived from licensing  humanization and royalty arrangements 
as of december   we received royalties on five marketed products  with approximately of our royalty revenues derived from the herceptin antibody product marketed by genentech and the synagis antibody product marketed by medimmune 
we do not currently anticipate having proprietary marketed products prior to accordingly  our revenues and related cash flows depend substantially on the success of our licensees and our ability to enter into new licensing and royalty arrangements 
significant risks in general  we have a history of operating losses and may not achieve sustained profitability 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
our expenses will increase over the next several years because of the extensive resource commitments required to identify and develop antibody candidates  including the ongoing operating costs associated with our acquisition of eos biotechnologies  inc see acquisition of eos below  to achieve regulatory approval and to market potential products for commercial success for any individual product 
over the next several years  we expect to incur substantial additional expenses as we continue to identify  develop and manufacture our potential products  invest in research and improve and expand our development  manufacturing  marketing and sales capabilities 
since we or our collaborative partners or licensees may not be able to successfully develop additional products  obtain required regulatory approvals  manufacture products at an acceptable cost and with appropriate quality  or successfully market such products with desired margins  we may never achieve sustained profitable operations 
the amount of net losses and the time required to reach sustained profitability are highly uncertain 
although we have had some profitable reporting periods  we do not expect to achieve sustained profitability until we are able to market and sell products 
since our goal is to launch our first product or products into the north american market by  our ability to achieve this cash flow positive position would not occur sooner than that  if we were successful 
our commitment of resources to research and the continued development of our products will require significant additional funds 
our operating expenses may also increase as some of our earlier stage potential products move into later stage clinical development  as additional potential products are selected as clinical candidates for further development  as we invest in additional manufacturing capacity  as we defend or prosecute our patents and patent applications  and as we invest in research or acquire additional technologies  product candidates or businesses 
in the absence of substantial revenues from new corporate collaborations or patent rights or patent licensing or humanization agreements  significant royalties on sales of products licensed under our intellectual property rights  product sales or other uncertain sources of revenue  we will incur substantial operating losses 
acquisition of eos in april  we completed the acquisition of eos biotechnology  inc eos  a privately held south san francisco based antibody discovery company  in exchange for approximately million shares of our common stock 
the eos acquisition expanded our research personnel and added new capabilities in antibody target identification and validation  particularly in oncology 
we also obtained two pre clinical antibody product candidates  one of the antibody candidates m  which began clinical development in may  targets potential treatment of solid tumors  and the second f targets potential treatment of certain ocular indications 
the eos acquisition was accounted for as an acquisition of assets rather than as a business combination as eos was a development stage company that had not commenced its planned principal operations 
eos lacked the necessary elements of a business because it did not have completed products and  therefore  no ability to access customers 
the eos operating results have been included in our consolidated results of operations since april  in conjunction with this transaction  we recorded a charge of approximately million related to acquired in process research and development in the second quarter of the aggregate purchase price was million  consisting of the shares issued to the eos stockholders valued at million including the value of shares withheld to provide for tax liabilities of million  transaction costs of million and employee change of control costs of million 
the shares issued in connection with this acquisition were valued at per share  which represented the average of the closing market price of our common stock a few days before and after the acquisition announcement date february  
acquisition of daclizumab effective october  we entered into an amendment to our collaboration agreement with roche  pursuant to which we now have exclusive worldwide rights to market  develop  manufacture and sell zenapax daclizumab in all disease indications other than transplantation 
roche is currently expected to continue to market zenapax in transplantation indications until  although an earlier transfer to us of rights in transplantation may occur upon six months written notice at roche s election 
under the new arrangement  we assumed worldwide responsibility for the development and  if successful  sales and marketing of daclizumab in all indications other than transplantation 
we also have rights to manufacture daclizumab 
in connection with the new arrangement  we paid roche million in cash for return of exclusive rights in indications other than transplantation  and we obtained an option to acquire rights in transplant indications reversion right  exercisable by us in  but effective in or as early as at the election of roche 
to effectuate the transfer of zenapax in the transplantation indications  we will pay an additional exercise fee to roche based on the average annual gross sales of zenapax during the period from january  through the calendar quarter prior to the date of notice of the exercise  or roche s notice of its decision to transfer the rights to us prior to our exercise date 
if we do not receive transplantation rights  we would pay modest royalties to roche on any sales in all diseases other than transplantation  and would continue to receive royalties on sales of zenapax in transplantation 
of the million that we paid to roche in october  we recorded a charge to acquired in process research and development totaling approximately million 
we capitalized the remaining amount of million  which relates to core technology and the reversion right 
we are amortizing the value of the core technology  million  over the term of the patents underlying the acquired technology 
we will reclassify the reversion right asset  million  into core technology at the time when the rights to the technology revert back to us  which at our option will be no later than  but could be as early as at the election of roche 
upon reclassifying the reversion right asset to core technology  we will amortize the asset over the remaining term of the patents underlying the acquired technology 
critical accounting policies and the use of estimates the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
the items in our financial statements requiring significant estimates and judgments are as follows revenue recognition we currently recognize three types of revenues resulting from the licensing and use of our technology  and from services we sometimes perform in connection with the licensed technology 
these revenues are typically derived from our proprietary patent portfolio covering the development  use  sale and importation of humanized antibodies 
we enter into patent license and humanization agreements that may contain other elements  such as royalties and milestones related to the achievement of particular stages in product development 
as a result  significant contract interpretation is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting  including whether the deliverables specified in a multiple element arrangement should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes  and if so  how the aggregate contract value should be allocated among the deliverable elements and when to recognize revenue for each element 
we recognize revenue for delivered elements only when the fair values of undelivered elements are known  when the associated earnings process is complete and  to the extent the milestone amount relates to our performance obligation  when our customer confirms that we have met the requirements under the terms of the agreement and when payment is reasonably assured 
changes in the allocation of the contract value between deliverable elements might impact the timing of revenue recognition  but in any event  would not change the total revenue recognized on the contract 
under our humanization agreements  the licensee typically pays an upfront fee for us to humanize an antibody 
these upfront fees are recognized on a percent completion basis  as the humanization work is performed  which is typically over three to six months 
we follow this method because we can reliably estimate the progress of each project based on information from our scientists 
due to our extensive experience in humanizing antibodies  coupled with the short term nature of the humanization contracts  the likelihood that the actual progress is materially different than that reflected in our revenues at the end of any particular reporting period is low 
historically  revenues recognized have approximated actual progress under each humanization agreement 
clinical trial expenses our cost accruals for clinical trials are based on estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with numerous clinical trial centers and clinical research organizations 
in the normal course of business we contract with third parties to perform various clinical trial activities in the on going development of potential drugs 
the financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation and variation from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows 
payments under the contracts depend on factors such as the achievement of certain events or the successful accrual of patients or the completion of portions of the clinical trial or similar conditions 
the objective of our accrual policy is to match the recording of expenses in our financial statements to the actual services received and efforts expended 
as such  direct expenses related to each patient enrolled in a clinical trial are recognized on an estimated cost per patient basis as services are performed 
in addition to considering information from our clinical operations group regarding the status of our clinical trials  we rely on information from contract research organizations cros  such as estimated costs per patient  to calculate our accrual for direct clinical expenses at the end of each reporting period 
for indirect expenses  which relate to site and other administrative costs to manage our clinical trials  we rely on information provided by the cro  including costs incurred by the cro as of a particular reporting date  to calculate our indirect clinical expenses 
in the event of early termination of a clinical trial  we accrue an amount based on our estimate of the remaining non cancelable obligations associated with the winding down of the clinical trial  which we confirm directly with the cro 
our estimates and assumptions could differ significantly from the amounts that may actually be incurred  however  our experience has been that our estimates at the end of any particular reporting period have been materially accurate 
intangible assets the valuation in connection with the initial purchase and the ongoing evaluation for impairment of intangible assets requires significant management estimates and judgment 
the purchase price allocation process requires management estimates and judgment as to expectations for various products and business strategies 
for example  we estimate future probability adjusted cash flows and certain discount rates as well as assumed commercialization dates for future potential products 
these estimations affect the allocation between charges to acquired in process research and development and capitalization of intangible assets 
if any of the significant assumptions differ from the estimates and judgments used in the purchase price allocation  this could result in different valuations for intangible assets 
once the values for intangible assets are established  we must test intangible assets with definite useful lives for impairment in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
when we conduct our impairment tests for intangibles  factors that are considered important in determining whether impairment might exist include significant changes in our underlying business and product candidates or other factors specific to each asset being evaluated 
any changes in key assumptions about the business and its prospects  or changes in market conditions or other externalities  could result in an impairment charge and such a charge could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations 
results of operations years ended december   and total revenues annual percent change years ended december  in thousands total revenues    our total revenues for were million  a increase from due to higher royalties and license fees when compared to total revenues for were million  a increase from due to higher royalties  partially offset by lower license and other revenues 
these revenue changes are further discussed below 
annual percent change years ended december  in thousands revenues royalties    license and other    royalties royalty revenues recognized under agreements with roche  genentech  medimmune and wyeth were million in compared to million in  an increase of compared to an increase of in from in  the increase was primarily due to increased herceptin sales reported by genentech and higher synagis sales reported by medimmune 
royalty payments from medimmune and genentech accounted for and  respectively  of our royalty revenues during the increase in royalty revenues in when compared to was primarily due to higher third party sales of synagis and herceptin 
in  royalty revenues from medimmune and genentech accounted for and of our royalty revenues  respectively 
in  royalty revenues from medimmune and genentech accounted for and of our royalty revenues  respectively 
we expect that in  with the additional licensed products brought to market in late and the launch of genentech s avastin antibody product in  we will continue to experience royalty revenue growth 
we also continue to expect quarterly fluctuations in royalty revenues due to the seasonality of sales of synagis 
license and other revenues years ended december  in thousands license and other revenues patent right and licensing    humanization and other    total license and other revenues    license and other revenues were million in  an increase of from license and other revenues were million in  a decrease of from license and other revenues recognized primarily consist of upfront patent licensing and patent rights fees  milestones  amortization of upfront fees associated with humanization agreements and license maintenance fees 
the increase in license and other revenues in was primarily due to the fact that we entered into more patent licensing agreements in as compared with as well as higher milestone revenue in as compared with in  we entered into six patent licensing agreements  compared to one patent rights and one patent licensing agreement in in addition  in  we recognized million in milestone revenues  with no such comparable revenues in the decrease in license and other revenues in from was primarily due to the fact that we entered into fewer patent licensing  patent rights and humanization agreements in as compared with and due to greater milestone and humanization revenues in as compared with in  we entered into one patent rights and one patent licensing agreement  as compared with three patent rights agreements in in addition  in  we recognized more than million in milestone and humanization revenues  with no such comparable revenues in we expect quarterly fluctuations in license and other revenues depending on the number of new contract arrangements we enter into and milestones achieved by our licensees 
costs and expenses annual percent change years ended december  in thousands costs and expenses research and development    general and administrative    acquired in process research and development  total costs and expenses    research and development expenses research and development expenses in were million  an increase of from research and development expenses in were million  an increase of from research and development costs include costs of personnel to support our research and development activities  costs of preclinical studies  costs of conducting our clinical trials  such as clinical investigator fees  monitoring costs  data management and drug supply costs  research and development funding provided to third parties and an allocation of facility costs 
the increase in was primarily due to an increase in personnel costs of approximately million  in large part resulting from an increase of research and development personnel of approximately employees as a result of the acquisition of eos  and the hiring of additional employees to pursue our expanding research and development programs 
also contributing to the increase were additional clinical development activities for our major research and development projects of approximately million and an increase in facility related expenses of million  resulting from the expansion of our facilities in these increases in costs were partially offset by lower research and development funding provided to exelixis of million 
the increase in was primarily related to an increase in research and development personnel headcount of approximately employees and associated increase in personnel costs of approximately million  higher research and development funding provided to exelixis of million  reflecting a full year of funding in compared to a partial year of funding in  and higher preclinical studies costs of million 
we expect our research and development expenses will continue to increase as we invest in manufacturing  advance our product candidates into later stages of development and add new product candidates 
more specifically  the increase is expected to relate primarily to expanded clinical trial activity  including associated direct scale up and manufacturing expenses  and the additional headcount required to execute our clinical trial programs as well as the further expansion of our research  preclinical  manufacturing and process development infrastructure 
below is a summary of products and the related stages of development for each product in clinical development  including the research and development expenses recognized in connection with each product 
research and development expenses for the year ended december  product phase of development estimated completion of phase description indication collaborator in thousands current product candidates daclizumab asthma phase ii ulcerative colitis phase ii huzaf crohn s disease phase ii psoriasis phase i ii completed nuvion steroid refractory graft vs

product acquired from eos in april product was returned to glaxosmithkline 
target related intellectual property outlicensed in december further development of these products by pdl is not currently expected  some of these candidates are available for out license 
no single potential product included in other constitutes more than of the total research and development expenses for the period presented 
the information in the column labeled estimated completion of phase is our current estimate of the timing of completion of product development phases 
the actual timing of completion of those phases could differ materially from the estimates provided in the table 
the clinical development portion of these programs may span as many as seven to ten years and any further estimation of completion dates or costs to complete would be highly speculative and subjective due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing biopharmaceutical products  including significant and changing government regulation  the uncertainty of future preclinical and clinical study results and uncertainties associated with process development and manufacturing as well as marketing 
for a discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with the timing of completing a product development phase  see the clinical development is inherently uncertain and expense levels may fluctuate unexpectedly because we can not accurately predict the timing and level of such expenses  if we cannot successfully complete our clinical trials  we will be unable to obtain regulatory approvals required to market our products  our clinical trial strategy may increase the risk of clinical trial difficulties  if we do not attract and retain key employees  our business could be impaired  and we may be unable to obtain or maintain regulatory approval for our products sections of our risk factors 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses in were million  an increase of from in  general and administrative expenses were million  an increase of from general and administrative costs include costs of personnel  professional services  patent  consulting and other expenses related to our administrative functions and an allocation of facility costs 
the increase in was primarily related to increased personnel and recruiting costs of million  higher legal costs related to our intellectual property  licensing and other contractual matters of million  increased facility related costs of million  and stock based compensation expense associated with the issuance of stock options to non employees in of approximately million 
the increase in was primarily related to increased personnel and recruiting costs of million  legal costs related to our intellectual property  licensing and other contractual matters of million and million related to maintenance agreements for our document control software systems 
we expect that general and administrative expenses will continue to increase as we build infrastructure and support for expanded research and development capabilities 
acquired in process research and development eos acquisition in connection with the april acquisition of eos  we recorded charges for acquired in process research and development of million due to eos incomplete research and development programs that had not yet reached technological feasibility as of april  and had no alternative future use as of that date

acquisition of zenapax rights from roche effective october  we entered into an amendment to our collaboration agreement with roche  pursuant to which we now have exclusive worldwide rights to market  develop  manufacture and sell zenapax daclizumab in all disease indications other than transplantation 
in connection with the new arrangement  we paid roche million in cash for return of exclusive rights in indications other than transplantation  and we obtained an option to acquire rights in transplant indications reversion right  exercisable by us in  but effective in or as early as at the election of roche 
of the million that we paid to roche in october  we recorded a charge to acquired in process research and development totaling approximately million 
this amount relates to the rights to autoimmune indications for daclizumab that are currently being developed and tested in clinical studies  specifically to treat ulcerative colitis and asthma 
we are evaluating daclizumab in two phase ii clinical studies in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis and asthma 
these trials were fully enrolled by the end of december  and we anticipate that results may be available in mid year assumptions underlying in process research and development charges the values of the acquired in process research and development from both the eos acquisition and the roche arrangement were determined by estimating the related future probability adjusted net cash flows  which were then discounted to present values using a rate of 
this discount rate is a significant assumption and is based on our estimated weighted average cost of capital taking into account the risks associated with the projects acquired 
the projected cash flows from such projects were based on estimates of revenues and operating profits related to such projects considering the stage of development of each potential product acquired  the time and resources needed to complete each product  the estimated life of each potential commercialized product and associated risks including the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in developing a drug compound including obtaining fda and other regulatory approvals  and risks related to the viability of and potential alternative treatments in any future target markets 
in determining the value of the acquired in process research and development  the assumed commercialization dates used for the potential products ranged from to and to related to the eos acquisition and the roche arrangement  respectively 
numerous risks and uncertainties exist with timely completion of development  including the uncertainty and timing of commencing human clinical trials and patient enrollment  as well as uncertainties related to the results of such studies  including interpretation of the data and obtaining fda and other regulatory body approvals 
the nature of the remaining efforts for completion of the acquired in process research and development projects primarily consist of initiating clinical trials and studies  the cost  length and success of which are extremely difficult to determine 
feedback from regulatory authorities or results from clinical studies might require modifications or delays in later stage clinical trials or additional studies to be performed 
the acquired products under development may never be successfully commercialized due to the uncertainties associated with the pricing of new pharmaceuticals and the fact that the cost of sales to produce these products in a commercial setting has not been determined 
if these programs cannot be completed on a timely basis  then our prospects for future revenue growth would be adversely impacted 
interest and other income  interest expense and impairment loss on investment annual percent change years ended december in thousands interest and other income  interest expense and investment impairment interest and other income  net    interest expense    impairment loss on investment  interest and other income  net was million in  a decrease of from in  interest and other income was million  a decrease of from in  interest and other income  net consists of interest income of million  partially offset by early debt extinguishment charges of approximately million 
interest income decreased by million in when compared to primarily due to declining interest rates on our marketable securities 
interest income in was compared to million in also in  the decrease in interest earned was due largely to the decreased interest earned on our marketable securities balances primarily as a result of lower market interest rates 
interest expense in  net of amounts capitalized  related to our convertible subordinated notes that were redeemed in november  our convertible subordinated notes  a term loan associated with the purchase our fremont  california facilities  and notes payable assumed in our acquisition of eos in the second quarter of interest expense in related to our convertible subordinated notes and a term loan associated with the purchase our fremont  california facilities 
interest expense in was million  an increase of from interest expense in was million  a decrease of from interest expense for increased slightly compared to the same period in  due to increased interest expense resulting from the issuance of the convertible notes in july  including higher amortization of associated debt issuance costs  and the notes payable assumed from the eos acquisition  partially offset by increased capitalized interest 
capitalized interest was million and million in and  respectively  in connection with the renovation of our existing manufacturing facilities and the development activities for our future manufacturing facilities 
the decrease in when compared to was the result of capitalizing million of our interest cost in in connection with the renovation of our existing manufacturing facilities and the development and construction activities for our future manufacturing facilities 
no interest was capitalized in in january  we sold the assets of our small molecule group to signature bioscience  inc signature  a privately held drug discovery company  in exchange for  shares of signature convertible preferred stock 
the stock received was recorded at the net book value of the assets sold plus transaction costs incurred  which approximated million 
in conjunction with this transaction  in december  we accrued an additional million payable to signature in connection with cash retention bonuses to designated key employees still employed by signature after one year 
pursuant to the terms of the agreement  in exchange for these bonus payments we received in early an additional  shares of signature convertible preferred stock  which was recorded as an increase in the carrying value of the preferred stock 
since the shares we received are not publicly traded  the value of the shares is therefore difficult to estimate 
as of december   we estimated that the value of our investment in signature had declined to  and that an impairment of our investment had occurred and that such impairment was other then temporary 
accordingly  we recorded an impairment charge of million in december the amount of the charge was based on the difference between the estimated fair value as determined by our management and our original cost basis in the shares of approximately million 
as of march   we estimated that our investment in signature had become fully impaired and that such impairment was other than temporary 
accordingly  we recorded an impairment charge of  in march income taxes we have recorded a tax provision of approximately  for primarily related to income earned in our foreign operations and foreign withholding tax in connection with a license maintenance fee  compared to  for we do not expect to record any tax provision for federal income taxes during based upon our projected us tax loss for liquidity and capital resources to date  we have financed our operations primarily through public and private placements of equity and debt securities  revenue under agreements with third parties and interest income on invested capital 
at december   we had cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities and restricted investments in the aggregate of million  compared to million at december  net cash used in our operating activities in was approximately million compared with net cash used in operating activities of million in in  the change in cash used in operating activities as compared to related primarily to the funding of greater operating expenses  increases in other current assets and other assets resulting from the transaction costs associated with the issuance of our convertible notes  partially offset by an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities resulting from the construction of our new commercial manufacturing facility in brooklyn park  minnesota 
net cash used in our operating activities in was approximately million compared with net cash provided by operating activities of million in the change was primarily due to a net loss in  partially offset by a decrease in interest receivable in versus an increase in interest receivable in and the non cash impairment loss on our investment in signature in in  net cash used in our investing activities was million  compared to cash provided by investing activities in of million 
the change in was primarily the result of purchases of marketable securities associated with the issuance of our convertible notes  as well as the purchase of intangible assets and increased purchases of property and equipment 
purchases of property and equipment in was primarily related to the development and construction activities for our manufacturing facility in brooklyn park  minnesota 
the purchase of intangible assets related to an amendment to our collaboration agreement with roche  pursuant to which we paid roche million in cash in return for exclusive worldwide rights to market  manufacture and sell daclizumab in all disease indications other than transplantation  resulting in a charge to in process research and development of million and intangible assets of million 
in  purchases of land  property and equipment primarily consisted of land and equipment purchases in connection with the renovation of our existing plymouth  minnesota manufacturing facility as well as construction activities for our manufacturing facility in brooklyn park  minnesota 
net cash provided by our investing activities in was million compared to net cash used in our investing activities of million in the change in was primarily the result of an increase in maturities of marketable securities and a decrease in purchases of marketable securities during the period as compared to our maturities and reinvestment activities associated with the purchases of short and long term investments in  as a result of the investment of higher cash balances at the end of resulting from a follow on offering in the third quarter of also  the increase is attributable to higher capital expenditures in  which primarily related to the renovation of our plymouth  minnesota manufacturing facility and development and construction activities and the purchase of land for our manufacturing facility in brooklyn park  minnesota 
capital expenditures in primarily consisted of equipment purchases and renovation of our plymouth  minnesota manufacturing facility 
net cash provided by our financing activities in was million compared to million in the change in from was primarily the result of the proceeds totaling million from the issuance of our convertible notes in july  partially offset by the redemption of our convertible notes in november in the aggregate of approximately million 
the decrease in net cash provided by our financing activities in as compared to net cash provided by our financing activities of million in was primarily the result of a decrease in the exercise of outstanding stock options 
we estimate that our existing capital resources will be sufficient to fund our current level of operations for at least the next four years 
our future capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including  among others  royalties from sales of products by third party licensees  including synagis  herceptin  xolair  raptiva  zenapax  mylotarg and avastin  our ability to enter into additional collaborative  humanization  patent license and patent rights agreements  interest income  progress of product candidates in clinical trials  the ability of our licensees to obtain regulatory approval and successfully manufacture and market products licensed under our patents  the continued or additional support by our collaborative partners or other third parties of research and development efforts and clinical trials  investment in existing and new research and development programs  time required to gain regulatory approvals  significant resources we will devote to constructing and qualifying our manufacturing facilities  our ability to obtain and retain funding from third parties under collaborative arrangements  our continued development of internal marketing and sales capabilities  the demand for our potential products  if and when approved  potential acquisitions of technology  product candidates or businesses by us  and the costs of defending or prosecuting any patent opposition or litigation necessary to protect our proprietary technology 
in order to develop and commercialize our potential products we may need to raise substantial additional funds through equity or debt financings  collaborative arrangements  the use of sponsored research efforts or other means 
no assurance can be given that such additional financing will be available on acceptable terms  if at all  and such financing may only be available on terms dilutive to existing stockholders 
in september  fremont holding llc our wholly owned subsidiary obtained a million term loan to purchase our fremont  california facilities 
the loan bears interest at the rate of per year amortized over years with principal and interest payable monthly 
the loan is secured by our fremont  california facilities and is subject to the terms and covenants of the loan agreement 
in november  we paid approximately million in cash to redeem our convertible notes due february   including accrued interest of million and prepayment obligations of approximately million in connection with the redemption 
in addition to the million in prepayment obligations for early extinguishment of these notes  we recorded a charge to write off the unamortized balance of the original debt issuance costs of approximately million  these charges  totaling million  are included in interest and other income  net  in the consolidated statement of operations 
in may  we signed a collaborative agreement with exelixis  inc to discover and develop humanized antibodies for the diagnosis  prevention and treatment of cancer 
we agreed to provide exelixis with million in annual research funding through june   and we purchased a million five year note  convertible at our option after the first year of the collaboration into exelixis common stock 
the research funding period ended in june during the funding period  exelixis performed certain genetic screens and other research activities intended to identify and validate targets for antibody therapeutics in oncology 
we received an exclusive  worldwide license to develop antibodies against certain targets identified by exelixis that are involved in cell growth  cell death and proliferation 
exelixis has the right to co fund development of antibodies resulting from the collaboration 
therefore  we recognized the expense of research funding ratably over the periods for which it was performed 
for antibody products we develop that exelixis elects not to co fund  we have agreed to make specified milestone payments and royalty payments on any product sales 
in july  we issued convertible subordinated notes due august  in the aggregate with a principal amount of million 
the convertible notes are convertible into our common stock at a conversion price of per share  subject to adjustment in certain events and at the holders option 
interest on the convertible notes is payable semiannually in arrears on february and august of each year 
the convertible notes are unsecured and are subordinated to all our existing and future senior indebtedness and may be redeemed at our option  in whole or in part  beginning on august  at par value 
in addition  in august  august and august  holders of our convertible notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes at of their principal amount  plus any accrued and unpaid interest to  but excluding  such date 
for convertible notes to be repurchased in august  we must pay for the repurchase in cash  and we may pay for the repurchase of notes to be repurchased in august and august  at our option  in cash  shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock 
in the third quarter of  we filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission covering the resale of the convertible notes and the common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes 
we pledged a portfolio of us government securities costing approximately million as security for the convertible notes 
these securities  and the earnings thereon  will be sufficient to pay the first six scheduled interest payments due on the notes 
the pledged amount of million has been classified as restricted investments on our consolidated balance sheet 
the portion related to payments to be made within one year  million  is reflected on the consolidated balance sheet within marketable securities and the portion related to payments to be made thereafter  million  is reflected on the consolidated balance sheet as long term restricted investments 
in connection with the construction of our new commercial manufacturing facility in brooklyn park  minnesota  we have entered into  and will continue to enter into  agreements with third parties for the construction and design of the facility 
we have engaged fluor daniel a division of fluor enterprises to handle the engineering and certain procurement services for the new facility 
in addition  we engaged fluor daniel to perform systems integration and assist in commissioning of the facility 
as of december   under these arrangements  the aggregate contractual costs totaled approximately million  of which approximately million and million is remaining to be paid in and  respectively

 consolidation of variable interest entities  fin 
fin requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
a variable interest entity is a corporation  partnership  trust  or any other legal structures used for business purposes that either a does not have equity investors with voting rights or b has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities 
a variable interest entity may be essentially passive or it may engage in research and development or other activities on behalf of another company 
the consolidation requirements of fin apply immediately to variable interest entities created after january  the consolidation requirements apply to older entities for interim periods ending after march  certain of the disclosure requirements apply to all financial statements issued after january   regardless of when the variable interest entity was established

item a 
market risk s interest rate risk we maintain a non trading investment portfolio of investment grade  highly liquid debt securities  which limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue  issuer or type of instrument 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
we hold a million five year convertible note receivable purchased from exelixis  inc in may accounting rules require the conversion feature of some convertible notes to be separated from the debt agreement in which the conversion feature is contained and accounted for as a derivative instrument  and therefore reflected in the note purchaser s financial statements based upon the fair market value of the stock into which the note is convertible 
due in part to the number of shares into which this note receivable would currently convert and the average daily trading volume of exelixis stock  the exelixis note is not currently considered a derivative instrument and  therefore  changes in the market value of exelixis stock are not required to be recorded in our financial statements 
however  a significant increase in the average daily trading volume of exelixis stock  or changes or interpretations in accounting principles could require us to report the value of the exelixis stock in our financial statements 
such a requirement could cause us to include changes in the exelixis stock price on a quarterly basis and would contribute to fluctuation in our operating results from quarter to quarter 
the securities in our investment portfolio are not leveraged and are classified as available for sale and therefore are subject to interest rate risk 
we do not currently hedge interest rate exposure 
if market interest rates were to increase by basis points from december  levels  the fair value of the portfolio would decline by approximately million 
the modeling technique used measures the change in fair values arising from an immediate hypothetical shift in market interest rates and assumes ending fair values include principal plus accrued interest 
as of december   the aggregate fair values of our long term debt and convertible subordinated notes were approximately million and million  respectively 
the long term debt bears interest at a fixed rate of and the convertible subordinated notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 
these obligations are subject to interest rate risk because the fixed interest rates under these obligations may exceed current interest rates 
the following table presents information about our material debt obligations that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the table presents principal amounts and related weighted average interest rates by year of expected maturity for our debt obligations 
our convertible notes may be converted to common stock prior to the maturity date 
liabilities s thereafter total fair value long term debt  including current portion fixed rate   avg 
interest rate convertible subordinated notes fixed rate   avg 
interest rate the fair value of the remaining payments under our long term obligations is estimated using discounted cash flow analyses  based on our current incremental borrowing rate for similar types of borrowing arrangements 
foreign currency risk as we have operations outside of the united states  our financial results could be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we operate 
to date  our foreign operations have not been significant to our results of operations and financial condition  therefore  our current foreign currency risk is minimal
