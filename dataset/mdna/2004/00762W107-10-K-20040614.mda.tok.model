item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we provide best practices research and analysis across the health care industry 
best practices research identifies and analyzes specific management initiatives  processes and strategies that have been determined to produce the best results in solving common business problems or challenges 
members of each program are typically charged a fixed annual fee and have access to an integrated set of services  including best practices research studies  executive education seminars  customized research briefs and web based access to the program s content database and decision support tools 
our revenues grew in fiscal over fiscal  and grew in fiscal over fiscal we increased our contract value by at march  over march   and by at march  over march  we define contract value as the aggregate annualized revenue attributed to all membership agreements in effect at a given point in time  without regard to the initial term or remaining duration of any such agreement 
memberships in each of our fourteen best practices research programs are renewable at the end of their one year membership contracts 
our remaining programs provide best practices installation support 
these month program memberships help participants accelerate the adoption of best practices profiled in our research studies  and are therefore not individually renewable 
renewable programs generated more than of our revenues in fiscal  with the balance of our revenues generated by programs providing installation support 
costs associated with a new program initially increase more rapidly than revenues following introduction of the program because revenues associated with the new program are recognized ratably over the membership year while costs are expensed as incurred 
because we offer a standardized set of services  however  our program cost structure is relatively fixed and the incremental cost to serve an additional member is low 
in fiscal  our income from operations was million  compared to million in fiscal our operating costs and expenses consist of cost of services  member relations and marketing  general and administrative expenses and depreciation 
cost of services represents the costs associated with the production and delivery of our products and services 
member relations and marketing expenses include the costs of acquiring new members and renewing existing members 
general and administrative expenses include the costs of human resources and recruiting  finance and accounting  management information systems  facilities management  new program development and other administrative functions 
we completed our initial public offering in november as a private company  we entered into the following arrangements which were discontinued in connection with our initial public offering 
accordingly  we believe the effect of these items on our historical financial statements are not indicative of future results 
we entered into special equity based compensation arrangements with key employees 
these arrangements were predominantly the repurchase of stock options and a special bonus paid to optionholders in the absence of a public market for our stock 
since our initial public offering  we have not entered  and do not anticipate that in the future we will enter into any special compensation arrangements  although we incurred charges of  in fiscal with respect to arrangements entered into prior to our initial public offering 
we paid the affiliate company charge to dgb enterprises  inc  a corporation created by our former principal stockholder in to manage his various business interests  for strategic direction and oversight 
as of october   our newly constituted board of directors began to provide this strategic direction and oversight and  consequently  we no longer pay the affiliate company charge 
prior to our initial public offering  we were treated as an s corporation for federal income tax purposes 
as an s corporation  our taxable income or loss flowed through to  and was reportable by  our stockholders 
accordingly  we did not make any provision for federal income taxes in our financial statements for periods ending prior to the closing of our initial public offering 
in conjunction with our initial public offering  our s corporation status terminated and we became subject to federal income taxes at prevailing corporate rates 
the impact of this change resulted in a benefit for income taxes of million during the three months ended december  results of operations the following table shows statement of income data expressed as a percentage of revenues for the periods indicated 
fiscal year ended march  revenues costs and expenses cost of services excluding special compensation and stock option related expenses of  and member relations and marketing excluding special compensation and stock option related expenses of  and general and administrative excluding special compensation and stock option related expenses of  and depreciation and loss on disposal of fixed assets special compensation and stock option related expenses affiliate company charge total costs and expenses income from operations interest income income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income fiscal years ended march   and revenues 
total revenues increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  and increased to million in fiscal the increase in revenues was primarily due to the introduction and expansion of new programs  cross selling existing programs to existing members  and  to a lesser degree  sales to new member organizations and price increases 
we offered membership programs as of march   as of march  and as of march  our contract value increased from million at march  to million at march   and increased to million at march  we define contract value as the aggregate annualized revenue attributed to all membership agreements in effect at a given point in time  without regard to the initial term or remaining duration of any such agreement 
cost of services 
cost of services increased from million  or of revenues  in fiscal  to million  or of revenues  in fiscal and increased to million  or of revenues in fiscal costs associated with a new program initially increase more rapidly than revenues following introduction of the program because revenues associated with the new program are recognized ratably over the membership year while costs are expensed as incurred 
because we offer a standardized set of services  our program cost structure is relatively fixed and the incremental cost to serve an additional member is low 
consequently  while cost of services increased since fiscal  it has decreased as a percentage of revenues 
member relations and marketing 
member relations and marketing expense increased from million or of revenues in fiscal to million  or of revenues  in fiscal  and increased to million  or of revenues  in fiscal the increase in member relations and marketing expense was primarily due to an increase in sales staff and related costs associated with the introduction of new programs  as well as an increase in member relations personnel and related costs to serve the expanding membership base 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expense increased from million  or of revenues  in fiscal to million  or of revenues  in fiscal  and increased to million  or of revenues  in fiscal with the development of new programs and the expansion of several administrative functions 
the decrease as a percent of revenues in fiscal reflects the leveraging of resources across our larger revenue base 
the increase in fiscal reflects increased investment in recruiting and hiring efforts in the member relations and new product development areas 
general and administrative expense includes approximately million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively  of net charges from dgb enterprises  inc for expenses related to management services  shared space and facilities and certain administrative functions 
we believe these charges approximate the expense which would have been incurred had we provided the equivalent services internally 
see note to our financial statements for a detailed description of the administrative services agreement with dgb enterprises  inc depreciation 
depreciation expense decreased from million  or of revenues in fiscal  to million  or of revenues in fiscal  and decreased to million  or of revenues in fiscal the decrease in fiscal was due to lower capital expenditures in fiscal and fiscal as compared to prior years 
in fiscal  we incurred construction costs in connection with our move to our new headquarters facility and depreciation expense may increase in future periods as a result 
special compensation and stock option related expenses 
special compensation and stock option related expenses decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  and increased to million in fiscal since our initial public offering  we have not entered into  and we do not anticipate that we will enter in the future  any special compensation arrangements 
see note to our financial statements for a detailed description of these arrangements 
in fiscal and  we recognized approximately  and million in compensation expense reflecting additional federal insurance corporation act fica taxes as a result of the taxable income that employees recognized upon the exercise of common stock options

see note to our financial statements for more information regarding this charge 
interest income 
interest income increased million in fiscal  from million in fiscal and  in fiscal the growth was principally from income associated with the increased levels of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities increased as a result of cash flows from operating activities and cash flows from financing activities as further discussed in the liquidity and capital resources section below 
provision for income taxes 
we recorded a provision for income taxes of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
our effective income tax rate decreased to as of january  from primarily due to an increase in the amount of tax exempt interest income earned on our portfolio of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities and  to a lesser extent  changes in states where income was generated 
we will amend our washington  dc income tax return to file as a qualified high technology company 
if approved  our washington  dc income tax rate would be reduced to and we would incur a noncash charge to earnings of approximately million  representing the impact on our existing deferred tax asset of lowering the washington  dc income tax rate 
for further information please see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows from operating activities 
program memberships are generally payable by members at the beginning of the contract term 
the combination of revenue growth and advance payment of memberships typically results in operating activities generating net positive cash flows on an annual basis 
net cash flows provided by operating activities were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities at march  we expect that these funds and expected net positive cash flows from operations will satisfy working capital  financing activities and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months 
cash flows from investing activities 
net cash flows used in investing activities during fiscal were million  consisting of purchases of property and equipment 
net cash flows used in investing activities in fiscal were million  consisting of purchases of marketable securities of million and purchases of property and equipment of million

also in fiscal and  we received approximately  and  respectively  in proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
in january  our board of directors authorized a share repurchase of up to million of our common stock  and as of march   we had repurchased  shares of our common stock at a total cost of approximately million 
the lease on our former headquarters facility expired may  as of june   our headquarters are located in approximately  square feet of office space in washington  dc 
the facilities accommodate research  marketing and sales  information technology  administration  graphic services and operations personnel 
we lease our office facilities  and the lease expires in june the terms of the lease on the new facility contain provisions for rental escalation and we are required to pay our portion of executory costs such as taxes and insurance 
we are also obligated to take additional expansion space in the building pursuant to the lease 
we believe that our facilities are adequate for our current needs and that additional facilities are available for lease to meet any future needs 
we have entered into a million letter of credit agreement with a commercial bank which expires october   to provide a security deposit for our new office lease 
we pledged certain assets as collateral under the letter of credit agreement 
to date  no amounts have been drawn on this agreement 
the following summarizes certain of our contractual obligations at march  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
these arrangements are more fully described in notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
payments due by period in thousands total year yrs yrs yrs non cancelable operating leases facilities services contract total at march  and  we have no off balance sheet financing or other arrangements with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities established for purposes of facilitating off balance sheet financing or other debt arrangements or for other contractually narrow or limited purposes

repurchases will be made from time to time in open market and privately negotiated transactions subject to market conditions 
no minimum number of shares has been fixed 
we will fund our share repurchases with cash on hand and cash generated from operations 
exercise of certain options options granted to certain of our optionholders under our and stock based incentive compensation plans were exercised to acquire shares sold at various times in fiscal and fiscal upon the exercise of these options we received a total of approximately million in fiscal and million in fiscal in cash in payment of option exercise prices 
we recognized approximately  and million in compensation expense reflecting additional federal insurance corporation act taxes as a result of the taxable income that employees recognized upon the exercise of non qualified common stock options in fiscal and  respectively 
we also incurred additional compensation expense for tax reporting purposes  but not for financial reporting purposes  that increased our deferred tax asset to reflect allowable tax deductions that will be realized in the determination of our income tax liability and therefore reduce our future income tax payments 
in connection with these transactions  our deferred tax asset increased by approximately million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
although our provision for income taxes in the consolidated statements of income did not change since the tax benefit associated with the option exercises is recorded directly into stockholders equity  our actual cash payments will be reduced as we utilize our deferred tax asset 
as a result of the receipt of cash for the exercise of options  the incurrence of additional compensation expense and the recognition of a deferred tax asset  our stockholders equity increased by approximately million and million in fiscal and  respectively  in connection with the exercise of stock options 
significant related party transactions transactions with dgb enterprises  inc our founder  david g 
bradley owns a controlling interest in certain entities that operate in different industries from us 
in  our founder created dgb enterprises  inc to manage his various business interests including his ownership in us 
to achieve operating efficiencies  dgb enterprises  inc consolidated certain management and administrative functions for these entities  and assumed the primary lease on office space used by these entities and shared with us 
we entered into the following transactions with dgb enterprises and these other interests as follows management services dgb enterprises  inc provided us with direct senior management services  which resulted in an allocation in the three months ended june  in the amount of  for compensation and related charges for our acting chief executive officer 
the chief executive officer services charge was phased out in june when we hired a permanent chief executive officer 
we believe these charges approximate the costs which would have been incurred had we operated on a stand alone basis 
administrative services from january to june  the majority of our administrative functions  including recruiting  human resources  facilities and telecommunications  were provided under an administrative services agreement by dgb enterprises  inc  which provided similar services to all entities under our founder s control 
in july  we entered into a new administrative services agreement whereby we assumed internal management of substantially all these administrative functions while dgb enterprises  inc continued to provide us with services related to the facilities associated with our shared leased space 
under the new agreement we provide dgb enterprises  inc  and related entities owned or controlled by our founder  with a variety of administrative services including services related to information technology and support  payroll and accounting and recruiting 
this new agreement has a two year term 
fees for the services provided under all these agreements are based on direct costs per transaction  square footage  headcount or a fixed cost per month that approximates the cost for each entity to internally provide or externally source these services 
we believe these net charges approximate the costs which would have been incurred had we operated on a stand alone basis 
we incurred net charges under all these arrangements in the amount of million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
affiliate company charge dgb enterprises  inc assessed a fee for strategic direction and oversight services to us and to each of the entities controlled by our founder

transactions with the corporate executive board company in october  the company spun off the corporate executive board company  a division that provided best practices research and analysis focusing on corporate strategy  operations and general management issues for non health care companies 
we have a noncompetition agreement with the corporate executive board company which generally prohibits the corporate executive board company from selling any membership based products and services to health care providers 
additionally  the corporate executive board company is prohibited from selling such products and services to other types of health care organizations unless the products and services are of a general business nature and are principally sold to companies and institutions not in the health care industry 
this agreement ends on january  after that date  the corporate executive board company may sell membership based products and services in direct competition with us  which may have a material adverse effect on our revenues

this option was intended to provide us with shares to be issued upon the exercise of outstanding employee stock options so that our stockholders would not experience dilution because of the issuance of new shares upon such exercise 
our founder terminated this option immediately prior to our initial public offering by transferring shares of our common stock to us in an amount equal to the excess of the fair value of the stock over the exercise price of the option 
for more information on all of these transactions  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
summary of critical accounting policies we have identified the following policies as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
this listing is not a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
however  certain of our accounting policies are particularly important to the presentation of our financial position and results of operations and may require the application of significant judgment by our management  as a result they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
in applying those policies  our management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates 
those estimates are based on our historical experience  our observance of trends in the industry  information provided by our members and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
for a more detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
our critical accounting policies include use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition revenues from renewable research memberships and best practices installation support memberships are recognized over the term of the related subscription agreement  which is generally months 
fees are generally billable  and the full amount of program agreement fees receivable and related deferred revenue are recorded  when a letter agreement is signed by the member 
certain fees are billed on an installment basis 
members may request a refund of their fees  which is provided on a pro rata basis relative to the length of the service period 
as of march   and  approximately million  million and million  respectively  of deferred revenues were to be recognized beyond the following months 
cash equivalents and marketable securities included in cash equivalents are marketable securities that mature within three months of purchase 
investments with maturities of more than three months are classified as marketable securities 
as of march  and  the company s marketable securities consisted of us government agency obligations and washington  dc and other state tax exempt notes and bonds 
the company s marketable securities  which are classified as available for sale  are carried at fair market value based on quoted market prices 
the net unrealized gains and losses on available for sale marketable securities are excluded from net income and are included within accumulated elements of comprehensive income 
the specific identification method is used to compute the realized gains and losses on the sale of marketable securities 
current marketable securities have maturity dates within twelve months of the balance sheet date 
the company may not hold its marketable securities to maturity and may elect to sell the securities at any time 
allowance for uncollectible revenue our ability to collect outstanding receivables from our members has an effect on our operating performance and cash flows 
this effect is mitigated because memberships  which are predominantly annual contracts  are generally payable by members at the beginning of the contract term 
we record an allowance for uncollectible revenue as a reduction of revenue based on our ongoing monitoring of our members credit and the aging of receivables 
deferred incentive compensation direct incentive compensation related to the negotiation of new and renewal memberships is deferred and amortized on a straight line basis over the term of the related memberships 
deferred tax asset recoverability for tax purposes  we have deferred income tax assets consisting primarily of net operating loss carry forwards for regular federal and state income tax purposes generated from the exercise of common stock options 
in estimating future tax consequences  statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 
generally considers all expected future events in the determination and evaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we believe that our future taxable income will be sufficient for the full realization of the deferred income taxes 
however  sfas no 
does not consider the effect of future changes in existing tax laws or rates in the determination and evaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities until the new tax laws or rates are enacted 
we have established our deferred income tax assets and liabilities using currently enacted tax law and rates 
we will recognize an adjustment for the impact of new tax laws or rates on the existing deferred tax assets and liabilities when and if new tax laws or rates are enacted 
washington  dc income tax incentives the office of tax and revenue of the government of the district of columbia the office of tax and revenue has adopted regulations in accordance with the new e conomy transformation act of the act that modify the income and franchise tax  sales and use tax  and personal property tax regulations  effective april specifically  the regulations provide certain credits  exemptions and other benefits to a qualified high technology company qhtc 
we have performed an analysis to support our position that we meet the definition of a qhtc under the provisions of the act 
accordingly  we will amend our washington  dc income tax return and certain sales and use tax returns  to file as a qhtc 
as a qhtc  our washington  dc income tax rate will be and we will be eligible for certain washington  dc income tax credits 
in addition  we will be entitled to relief from certain sales and use taxes 
while we believe we qualify as a qhtc  we have not recognized the impact of this election within the financial statements for the fiscal year ended march  because of uncertainties inherent in the regulations  as adopted 
for financial reporting purposes  we have valued our deferred income tax assets and liabilities using washington  dc s currently enacted income tax rate of 
additionally  we have continued to provide for income  sales and use taxes as if we were not a qhtc 
however  if we had received a determination that we qualified for qhtc status  we would have recorded a charge to earnings of approximately million  representing the effects on our existing deferred tax assets of reducing the washington  dc income tax rate to  net of any income tax credits discussed above 
if we determine it is more likely than not that the office of tax and revenue will accept our election as a qhtc  we will record the applicable charge 
additionally  we would recognize the refund of any previously paid or provided sales and use taxes at that time 
recovery of long lived assets long lived assets and identifiable assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount should be addressed 
impairment is identified by comparing the carrying value to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets and their eventual dispositions 
impairment is measured and recorded on the basis of fair value determined using discounted cash flows 
we consider expected cash flows and estimated future operating results  trends and other available information in assessing whether the carrying value of assets is impaired 
we believe no such impairment existed as of march  or recent accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
this interpretation of arb no 
 consolidated financial statements  requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
we adopted fin as of march  the adoption had no impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in november  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  issue 
issue provides guidance for determining the unit s of accounting in arrangements that include multiple products  services  and or rights to use assets 
the adoption of issue had no impact on the company s financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate risk primarily through our portfolio of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  which is designed for safety of principal and liquidity 
cash and cash equivalents include investments in highly liquid us treasury obligations with maturities of less than three months 
at march   our marketable securities consist of million in tax exempt notes and bonds issued by the district of columbia  million in tax exempt notes and bonds issued by other states  and million in us government agency securities 
the average maturity on all our marketable securities as of march  was approximately years 
we perform periodic evaluations of the relative credit ratings related to the cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
this portfolio is subject to inherent interest rate risk as investments mature and are reinvested at current market interest rates 
we currently do not use derivative financial instruments to adjust our portfolio risk or income profile 
due to the nature of our investments we have not prepared quantitative disclosure for interest rate sensitivity in accordance with item of regulation s k as we believe the effect of interest rate fluctuations would not be material
