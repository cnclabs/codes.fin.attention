the following commentary should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere in the annual report on form k 
the information in this discussion contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
such statements are based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties 
any statements contained herein that are not statements of 
table of contents historical fact may be deemed to be forward looking statements 
for example  the words believes  anticipates  plans  expects  intends and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
our actual results and the timing of certain events may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that might cause such a discrepancy include  but are not limited to  those discussed in liquidity and capital resources and risk factors below 
all forward looking statements in this document are based on information available to us as of the date hereof and we assume no obligation to update any such forward looking statements 
recent events on june   terremark privately placed million in aggregate principal amount of senior convertible notes due june  we plan to utilize the net proceeds from this offering to pay all of our outstanding debt  for possible acquisitions and for general corporate purposes  including working capital and capital expenditures 
the notes are convertible at the option of the holders into our common stock at per share 
see liquidity and capital resources in this section for the impact of this transaction on our financial condition 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following significant accounting policies  among others  affect its judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition and allowance for bad debts  accounting for income taxes  impairment of long lived assets  and goodwill revenue recognition and allowance for bad debts currently  we derive our revenues from monthly recurring fees for colocation and exchange point services and managed services 
we also receive non recurring installation fee for colocation and exchange point services and for construction activities 
revenues from colocation  exchange point services and managed services are billed monthly and recognized ratably over the term of the contract 
installation fees are generally billed in the period in which the installation is performed but deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the related contract 
managed services fees are billed and recognized in the period in which the services are provided 
construction activities are billed in accordance with contract terms  but revenues are recognized on the percentage of completion method 
revenue is recognized as service is provided when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the receivable is reasonably assured 
we assess collection based on a number of factors  including transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
we do not request collateral from customers 
if we determine that collection is not reasonably assured  we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
as of march  and  our accounts receivable amounted to  and 
table of contents  respectively  and were net of allowance for doubtful accounts of approximately  and  respectively 
revenues from construction contracts are recognized on the percentage of completion method  measured by the percentage of costs incurred to date to total estimated costs for each contract 
this method is used because management considers cost incurred to be the best measure of progress on these contracts 
the duration of a construction contract generally exceeds one year 
billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts are classified as other liabilities and represent billings in excess of revenues recognized 
construction contract expense costs include all direct material and labor costs and indirect costs related to contract performance such as indirect labor  supplies  tools  repairs  bad debt and depreciation 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which losses are determined 
changes in job performance  job conditions and estimated profitability  including those arising from contract penalty provisions and final contract settlements may result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which the revisions can be reasonably estimated 
accordingly  it is possible that our current estimates relating to completion cost and profitability of our uncompleted contracts will vary from actual results 
excluding depreciation  profit margins construction contract revenue less construction contract expenses on construction contracts for the years ended march   and were   and  respectively 
we analyze current economic news and trends  historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness and changes in customer payment terms when evaluating revenue recognition and the adequacy of our allowance for bad debts 
accounting for income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
our accounting for deferred taxes involves the evaluation of a number of factors concerning the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
to support our conclusion that a valuation allowance was required  we primarily considered such factors as our history of operating losses  the nature of our deferred tax assets and the absence of taxable income in prior carryback years 
although our operating plans assume taxable and operating income in future periods  our evaluation of all the available evidence in assessing the realizability of the deferred tax assets indicates that such plans are not considered sufficient to overcome the available negative evidence 
our federal and state net operating loss carryforwards  amounting to approximately million  begin to expire in utilization of the net operating losses generated prior to the amtec merger may be limited by the internal revenue code 
should we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the foreseeable future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination is made 
impairment of long lived assets we account for impairment of long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which we adopted in fiscal this standard requires that long lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
such events and circumstances include  but are not limited to  prolonged industry downturns  significant decline in our market value and significant reductions in our projected cash flows 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying 
table of contents amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
significant judgments and assumptions are required in the forecast of future operating results used in the preparation of the estimated future cash flows  including long term forecasts of the number of additional customer contracts  profit margins  terminal growth rates and discounted rates 
if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
prior to adoption of sfas no 
 we accounted for long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
as of march  and  our long lived assets  including property and equipment  net and identifiable intangible assets and goodwill  totaled  and  respectively 
for the years ended march   and  we recognized impairment charges amounting to   and  respectively 
goodwill we account for goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas  goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite lives are not amortized but rather are tested at least annually for impairment or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be fully recoverable 
the goodwill impairment test involves a two step approach 
initially the fair value of the reporting units are compared with their carrying amount  including goodwill  to identify potential impairment 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized for the excess  if any  of the carrying value of goodwill over the implied fair value of goodwill 
intangible assets that have finite useful lives continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
prior to the adoption of sfas  intangible assets were generally amortized on the straight line method over five years 
in accordance with sfas  we ceased amortization of our intangible assets with indefinite lives and completed an initial impairment test of intangible assets as of april  management determined in the initial impairment test that these assets were not impaired based on their fair values 
fair value was estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows and the assumed market capitalization at the reporting unit level 
results of operations overview for the year ended march   approximately of our total revenues were generated from data center operations 
the remainder was substantially related to construction work 
for the year ended march   approximately of our total revenues were generated from data center operations 
the remainder was substantially related to construction work 
for the year ended march   approximately of our total revenues were generated from data center operations  approximately was from real estate projects and construction work  and approximately was from property and construction management 
during the past three years  our results of operations have been significantly impacted by our shift in focus to the housing and management of internet infrastructure after the nap of the americas became operational in july the sale of our telecom facilities management operations in february  and our exit from non core real estate activities by march  non core real estate activities included real estate development  property management  financing and other ancillary businesses that complemented the development operations 
our real estate activities currently include technology infrastructure construction work and management of the property where the nap of the americas is located

the following charts provide certain information with respect to our revenues for the twelve months ended march  revenue u 
s outside u 
s data center construction work property and construction management data center revenues consist of for the twelve months ended march  colocation exchange point services managed professional services contract termination fee data center revenue the increase in data center revenues was primarily the result of growth in our deployed customer base from customers as of march  to customers as of march  data center revenues consist of colocation services  such as leasing of space and provisioning of power  exchange point services  such as peering and cross connects  and managed and professional services  such as network management  network monitoring  procurement and installation of equipment and procurement of connectivity  managed router services  technical support and consulting 
our utilization of total net colocation space increased to from as of march  and  respectively 
our utilization of total net colocation space represents the percentage of space billed versus total space available for customers 
for comparative purposes total space available for customers includes third floor space in tecota for both march  and cross connects billed to customers increased to  from as of march  and  respectively 
data center contract termination fee represents amounts received from two customers for the termination of their contracted services with the nap of the americas 
as a result of these contract terminations  we experienced a decrease in monthly recurring revenues of approximately  contract termination fees are recognized upon contract termination when there are no remaining contingencies or obligations on our part 
we anticipate an increase in revenue from colocation  exchange point and managed services as we add more customers to our network of naps  sell additional services to existing customers and introduce new products and services 
we also expect managed and professional services to become an important source of revenue and increase as a proportion of data center services 

table of contents development  commission and construction fees decreased  to  for the twelve months ended march  from  for the twelve months ended march  we do not expect any revenues from development  commission and construction fees in the foreseeable future 
management fees increased  to  for the twelve months ended march  from  for the twelve months ended march  the only facility we currently manage is tecota  the property in which the nap of the americas is located 
we collect a monthly management fee from tecota equal to the greater of approximately  or of cash collected by tecota 
although in the future  we may manage properties where our centers are including tecota  we anticipate that management fees will not be a significant source of revenue in the foreseeable future 
construction contract revenue decreased million to  for the twelve months ended march  from million for the twelve months ended march  during the twelve months ended march  and  we completed three and eleven construction contracts  respectively 
as of march   we have one construction contract in process 
due to our approach to our construction business  we expect revenues from construction contracts to significantly fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
we anticipate focusing our efforts on obtaining construction contracts for projects related to technology infrastructure 
data center operations expenses 
data center operations expenses increased million  or  to million for the twelve months ended march  from million for the twelve months ended march  data center operations expenses consist mainly of rent  operations personnel  property taxes  electricity  chilled water  procurement of equipment and connectivity and security services 
the increase in total data center operations expenses is due to an increase of million in rent  an increase of  in electricity and chilled water  an increase of  in personnel costs and an increase of  in costs related to the procurement of equipment and connectivity under a us federal government contract 
the increase in rent expense is due to the july opening of our nap west facilities in santa clara  california and the leasing of an additional  square feet of space in the third floor of tecota  which commenced in november we have been paying rent for our nap west facilities since january but before we opened these facilities in july  related expenses were recorded as impairment charges 
rent expense is being recorded on the straight line method based on contractual amounts even though actual payments for the third floor of tecota will not commence until april the increase in personnel costs is mainly attributable to staff increase from operations employees in fiscal year to for fiscal year we anticipate that some data center expenses  principally electricity  chilled water  payroll and costs related to managed services  will increase as we provide additional services to existing customers and introduce new products and services 
contract construction expenses 
contract construction expenses decreased approximately million to  for the twelve months ended march  from million for the twelve months ended march  this decrease is a result of the decrease in number of construction contracts and average dollar amount of those contracts as discussed above in construction contract revenue 
we do not currently anticipate losses on any of the individual construction contracts 
general and administrative expense 
excluding non cash charges of million for stock based compensation  general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  to million for the twelve months ended march  from million for the twelve months ended march  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses  professional service fees  rent and other general corporate expenses 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses is due to a decrease in payroll of  in connection with the modification to our employment relationship with three employees  we accelerated the vesting on their outstanding stock options  awarded new stock options and or extended the life of their outstanding stock options 
as a result  we recognized a non cash  stock based compensation charge of approximately million in the year ended march  the decrease in payroll is mainly due to a reduction in staff levels 
the average number of employees whose salaries are included in general and administrative expenses decreased from for the twelve months ended march  to for the twelve months ended march  
table of contents sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses decreased  or  to for the twelve months ended march  from million for the twelve months ended march  the significant components of sales and marketing expenses are payroll and benefits 
the decrease in sales and marketing expenses is due to decreases in investor relations of  in travel and entertainment of  and in payroll and benefits of  during the twelve months ended march   we issued warrants valued at  to strategic growth international for investor relations services 
the decrease in payroll is mainly due to staff level reductions 
the number of employees whose salaries are included in sales and marketing expenses were and as of march  and  respectively 
the decrease in travel and entertainment is the result of overall reduction in spending due to cost containment efforts 
depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased  to million for the twelve months ended march  from million for the twelve months ended march  the decrease was due to reductions in property and equipment resulting primarily from impairment charges recorded during the year ended march   which in turn decreased depreciation expense 
impairment of long lived assets and goodwill 
during the three months ended march   we performed our annual test for impairment and concluded that these assets were not impaired 
debt restructuring 
during the twelve months ended march   we incurred a non cash gain of million related to financing transactions whereby million of our construction payables plus million in accrued interest was converted to million shares of our common stock with a million market value upon conversion 
interest expense 
excluding non cash charges  interest expense decreased to million from million for the years ended march  and  respectively 
we reduced the interest expense as a result of a reduction in the principal balance outstanding and a reduction in the interest rates 
due to the conversion of some of our debt and construction payables to equity which was partially offset by the issuance of new debt  our principal balance outstanding decreased to million from million as of march  and  respectively 
in addition our average interest rate on our debt decreased to from for the years ended march  and  respectively 
net non cash charges of approximately million represent the amortization of a beneficial conversion feature as additional interest expense partially offset by the amortization of a debt restructuring gain as reductions to interest expense 
other income expenses 
on november   a developer agreed to pay us a million non refundable fee to develop a facility in australia 
the developer paid us  upon execution of the agreement and the remaining balance of million on december  on february   the developer notified us it did not wish to proceed with negotiations regarding the construction of a terrenap center in australia 
on february   we acknowledged receipt of the developer s notification  and terminated the agreement with the developer 
as required by the agreement  we did not conduct any business related to the operation or management of data centers in australia until the agreement was terminated 
we have no further obligations in connection with the agreement with the developer and as a result recognized the million non refundable fee in the quarter ended march  net loss 
net loss for our reportable segments was as follows for the twelve months ended march  data center operations real estate services the net loss from data center operations is primarily the result of insufficient revenues to cover our operating and interest expenses 
we expect to generate net losses until we reach required levels of monthly 
table of contents revenues 
although we had a net operating loss for the current period  we anticipate that our real estate activities will generate sufficient revenues to cover their operating expenses and we do not expect to fund more than  per year of operating losses from our real estate activities in the foreseeable future 
results of operations for the year ended march  as compared to the year ended march  revenue 
total revenue decreased million  or  to million for the year ended march  from million for the year ended march  the decrease is due to a reduction in our development  management and construction contracts revenue of approximately million partially offset by an increase in data center revenue  including contract termination fee  of approximately million 
data center revenue increased million to million for the year ended march  from million for the year ended march  revenues consisted of recurring revenues of million and million respectively  for the years ended march  and  primarily from charges for colocation  power  peering and some managed services 
non recurring revenues were million and  respectively  for the years ended march  and  primarily related to managed services and the recognized portion of deferred installation revenue 
installation fees are recognized ratably over the term of the contract 
the increase in revenues was primarily the result of an increase in orders from existing customers and growth in our deployed customer base from customers as of march  to customers as of march  we anticipate an increase in revenues from colocation  power and peering and revenues from managed services as we add more customers to the nap of the americas  sell additional services to existing customers and introduce new products and services 
data center services revenues consist of colocation services  such as leasing of space and provisioning of power  exchange point services  such as peering and interconnection  and managed and professional services  such as network management  procurement and installation of equipment and procurement of connectivity  managed router services  technical support and consulting 
we anticipate an increase in revenue from colocation and exchange point services as we add more customers to our network of naps  sell additional services to existing customers and introduce new products and services 
we also expect managed and professional services to become an important source of revenue and increase as a percentage of data center services 
for the years ended march  and  data center services revenues consisted of the following colocation exchange point services managed professional services data center contract termination fee was million for the year ended march  and represents amounts received from two customers for the termination of their contracted services with the nap of the americas 
no fees were received during the year ended march  contract termination fees are recognized upon contract termination when there are no remaining contingencies or obligations on our part 
development  commission and construction fees decreased million  or  to  for the year ended march  from million for the year ended march  the decrease in development  commission and construction fees is primarily the result of our exiting of the underlying non core real estate activities 
we do not expect any significant amount of revenues from development  commission and construction fees 
management fees decreased million  or  to  for the year ended march  from million for the year ended march  the decrease is a result of our exiting the management of commercial and residential properties 
the only facility we currently manage is tecota  the property in which the nap of the americas is located 
we collect from tecota a monthly management fee of approximately  or of cash collected by tecota  whichever is greater 
during the fiscal year ended 
table of contents march   we managed approximately properties 
because we do not plan to manage properties other than tecota  we anticipate that management fees will not be a significant source of revenues in the future 
construction contract revenue decreased million  or  to million for the year ended march  from million for the year ended march  during the year ended march  we completed eleven contracts and  as of march   had two construction contracts in process 
during the year ended march   we completed two contracts and  as of march   we had five construction contracts in process 
the decrease in revenues from construction contracts is due to a decrease in the average revenue per contract  which went from average revenue per contract of million in fiscal year to average revenue per contract of  in fiscal year due to our opportunistic approach to our construction business  we expect revenues from construction contracts to significantly fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
we anticipate focusing our efforts on obtaining construction contracts for projects related to technology infrastructure 
data center operations expenses 
excluding depreciation  data center operations expenses remained constant at million for the years ended march  and data center operations consist mainly of rent  operations personnel  electricity  chilled water and security services 
with the exception of electricity and chilled water  the majority of these expenses are fixed in nature 
however  commencing in fiscal year  we anticipate that certain data center expenses  principally costs related to managed services  will increase as we provide additional services to existing customers and introduce into the market new products and services 
we also expect that our costs of electricity and chilled water costs will increase in the future as we add more customers to the nap of the americas 
the number of employees whose salaries are included in data center operations remained constant at during the years ended march  and contract construction expenses 
contract construction expenses decreased million  or  to million for the year ended march  from million for the year ended march  this decrease is a result of the decrease in number of contracts and dollar amount of those projects as discussed above in revenues from construction contracts 
we do not currently anticipate losses on any of the individual contracts 
start up costs data centers 
there were no start up costs for the year ended march  start up costs for the year ended march  primarily relate to the nap of the americas in miami  florida  and were approximately million 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  to million for the year ended march  from million for the year ended march  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses  professional service fees  rent and other general corporate expenses 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses is mainly due to decreases in rent of million and payroll of million 
carrying costs  including rent  for our corvin facility in santa clara  california for the year ended march  were reflected in the facility s impairment charge in the previous year 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we recognized as of march  an impairment charge of million  including million in expected lease carrying costs for the period of time until the facility could be sublet 
during the second quarter ended september   an additional  in expected lease carrying costs were recognized and included as part of impairment of long lived assets 
during the year ended march   the rent for the corvin facility for that year was included in general and administrative expenses 
the decrease in payroll is mainly attributable to staff reductions 
the number of employees whose salaries are included in general and administrative expenses decreased from for the year ended march  to for the year ended march  the remaining period over period decrease in general and administrative expenses is mainly attributable to a decrease in general corporate overhead resulting from our exit of non core real estate activities in the year ended march  
table of contents sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses increased  or  to million for the year ended march  from million for the year ended march  the significant components of sales and marketing expenses are salaries  commissions  provision for bad debt expenses and marketing 
the increase in sales and marketing expenses was mainly attributable to an increase in investor relations expense of  and an increase in provision for bad debt expenses of approximately  we issued warrants valued at approximately  to a third party for investor relations services 
provision for bad debt expense consists of full provisions related to eight customers 
we have commenced legal action against many of these customers 
the number of employees whose salaries are included in sales and marketing expenses increased slightly from as of march  to as of march  depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased million  or  to million for the year ended march  from million for the year ended march  this decrease in depreciation and amortization expense was mainly due to the cessation of million in amortization of goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with current accounting standards and a decrease in depreciation of approximately million related to our colocation facility in santa clara  california and non core assets 
the decrease was partially offset by an increase in depreciation of approximately million primarily from assets of the nap of the americas that were put in service during fiscal year and had a full year of depreciation in fiscal year impairment of long lived assets 
due principally to the decline and uncertainty of the telecommunications and internet infrastructure markets  we recognized the following impairment charges year ended march  asset facility in santa clara  california post shell goodwill tecota promote interest equipment as a result of impairment charges in the years ended march  and  the long lived assets described in the table above became fully impaired 
due to our unsuccessful efforts to lease space at our colocation facility in santa clara  california  during the quarter ended september   we granted an option to one of our vendors a contractor involved with the facility s build out to purchase the leasehold improvements and assume the existing lease for approximately million 
based on this option  we recorded a million impairment charge in the quarter ended september  to write the improvements down to the option amount 
subsequently  we continued to search for alternatives  which included subleasing or selling our leasehold improvements 
in the quarter ended march   upon expiration of the option  we listed our leasehold improvements for sale  indicating a definite change in the strategy 
we are now actively looking for a buyer to assume the existing lease or sublease all or a substantial portion of the space 
the existing lease is  per month  with scheduled annual increases  for a twenty year term ending in we believe that the most likely outcome is that the property will be subleased or leased from the landlord to a third party and that we will receive no consideration for the leasehold improvements 
based on this most likely scenario  in the quarter ended march   we recorded an additional million impairment  resulting in the asset being fully reserved 
we also established as of march  reserves for leasehold carrying costs  consisting primarily of monthly rent 
as of march   we had approximately million in related reserves which we anticipate will carry the facility through march the decline in the telecommunications industry and resulting decline in related real estate construction and leasing activities caused us to perform  during the years ended march  and  impairment analyses of our promote interests in tecota acquired in the telecom facilities management operations and the goodwill related to the post shell acquisition 
our analyses were based on estimated fair value determined by the discounted future expected cash flows method 
the analyses anticipated obtaining additional 
table of contents construction contracts for post shell and additional tenants for tecota 
we determined that the assets  which are included in our telecom facilities management and real estate services segments  were impaired as of march  by approximately million and million  respectively 
during the year ended march   no significant contracts were awarded to post shell and no tenants were added to tecota 
as a result  we impaired the remaining  in tecota promote interests and million in post shell goodwill 
during the year ended march   we wrote off  related to equipment that has been held for installation for more than one year and is considered obsolete 
on october   we entered into a joint venture agreement to develop and operate a hippa compliant network access point at the nap of the americas in miami  florida 
we acquired a interest in the joint venture company by issuing a million promissory note 
as the joint venture was not fully funded by december   we determined that our joint venture interest was impaired 
therefore  we recognized a million impairment as of december  effective march   we and the other joint venture partner entered into an agreement to declare void all the then current agreements and contracts  including the joint venture agreement 
as a result  we were no longer obligated under the promissory note 
the results of operations present  on a net basis  the effects of the formation and the dissolution of the joint venture and accordingly no gain or loss was recognized as a result of these transactions 
interest income 
interest income increased  or  to  for the year ended march  from  for the year ended march  the increase was due to the recording of interest income on a million note receivable from our chief executive officer which began accruing interest in september inducement on debt conversion 
during the year ended march   we incurred a non cash expense of million related to the million of our convertible debt that was converted into million shares of our common stock 
the debt was converted at per share  which was approximately below the stated conversion price 
this expense represents the fair value of the additional common shares issued by us as a result of the lower conversion price 
interest expense 
interest expense increased million  or  to million for the year ended march  from million for year ended march  the increase was due to an increase of million in the average debt balance outstanding 
the increase was offset by the conversion of million in convertible debt during the quarter ended december  and reduction in the interest rate of the ocean bank loan from to 
based on the april  transactions  we expect cash interest payments to be reduced by approximately  for the year ended march  gain on the sale of real estate held for sale 
in july  we sold fortune house ii for million and recorded a gain of approximately million 
during the year ended march   we also sold six condominium units and recorded a net gain of million 
the last condominium unit was sold in the quarter ended march  net loss income for our reportable segments was as follows for the year ended march  data center operations telecom facilities management real estate services the net loss for the year ended march  is mainly due to non cash items  including impairment charges of long lived assets of approximately million and depreciation and amortization expense of approximately million  interest expense of approximately million  and approximately million of expenses generated from the operations of the nap of the americas 
the net loss for our data center operations segment is primarily the result of insufficient revenues at the nap of the americas to cover our 
table of contents operating and interest expenses 
we expect to continue generating net losses from the data center operations segment until we reach required levels of monthly revenues 
the net loss from our telecom facilities management segment for the year ended march  resulted primarily from impairment  interest and general expenses from our collocation facility in santa clara  california 
there were no revenues generated from the facility during the period 
for the year ended march   the losses related to the facility were insignificant and included in data center operations 
the net loss from real estate activities for the years ended march  and resulted from insufficient revenues to support general and interest costs and impairments 
due to our exit of real estate activities not related to our strategy  we anticipate that the significance of the real estate activities to our overall operations will decrease 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity and recent developments we privately placed million in aggregate principal amount of senior convertible notes due june  to qualified institutional buyers on june  we also granted the initial purchasers of the notes a day option to purchase up to an additional million aggregate principal amount of the notes 
the notes bear interest at a rate of per annum  payable semi annually  beginning december  and are convertible at the option of the holders at per share 
we plan to utilize the net proceeds from this offering to pay all of our outstanding debt  for possible acquisitions and for general corporate purposes  including working capital and capital expenditures 
the senior notes will rank senior in priority with all existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness and senior in right of payment to all of existing and future subordinated indebtedness  and rank junior to any future secured indebtedness 
if there is a change in control  the holders have the right to require us to repurchase their notes at a price equal to of the principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
if we issue a cash dividend on our common stock  we will pay contingent interest to the holders equal to the product of the per share cash dividend and the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of each holder s note 
we may redeem some or all of the notes for cash at any time on or after june  if the closing price of our common shares has exceeded of the applicable conversion price for at least trading days within a period of consecutive trading days ending on the trading day before the date we mail the redemption notice 
if we redeem the notes during the twelve month period commencing on june  or  the redemption price equals or  respectively  of their principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any  to the redemption date  plus an amount equal to of all remaining scheduled interest payments on the notes from  and including  the redemption date through the maturity date 
on may   we provided certain debenture holders with notice of our intent to redeem million of our convertible debentures and million of our convertible debentures  effective may  as of may   all of the holders of our convertible debentures and million in principal of our convertible debentures opted to convert their debentures into an aggregate of  shares of our common stock 
in may  we issued three senior secured promissory notes in favor of veritas high yield arbitrage i fund  llc  veritas high yield arbitrage ii fund  llc  and veritas high yield arbitrage fund  bermuda ltd 
collectively the lenders for the aggregate amount of million 
the notes accrue interest at per annum  are paid monthly based on original face amount  and mature on october   with prepayment permitted without penalty after the first month 
historically  we have financed our operations and capital requirements primarily through our credit facility with ocean bank  issuance of unsecured notes  issuance of convertible debentures  private sale of common and preferred stock and vendor financing  including construction payables and capital lease obligations 
as of march   our total indebtedness was approximately million 
as of march   this amount was reduced to  including the conversion to equity of million of the ocean bank debt and million of certain construction payables  including accrued interest

 sab  revenue recognition 
sab updates portions of existing interpretative guidance in order to be consistent with current authoritative accounting and auditing guidance and sec rules and regulations 
the adoption of sab did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
this statement requires that an issuer classify financial instruments which are within its scope as a liability 
most of the guidance in sfas no 
is effective for all financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  the impact of the adoption of sfas on our consolidated financial statements was to present series h redeemable preferred stock as a liability 
in march  the fasb reached a consensus on emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
the consensus provides guidance on the accounting for multiple element revenue arrangements 
it also provided guidance on how to separate multiple element revenue arrangements into its separate units of accounting and how to measure and allocate the arrangement s total consideration 
the effective date of eitf is for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods interim or annual beginning after june  the adoption of eitf as of july  has not impacted our consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
fin requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
fin is effective immediately for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after january  in december  the fasb released a revised version of fin clarifying certain aspects of fin and providing certain entities with exemptions from the requirements of fin for variable interest entities created or acquired prior to february   the provisions of fin must be applied for the first interim or annual period ending after march  nap de las americas madrid sa is a variable interest entity but our current relationship indicates that it does not require consolidation since we are not the primary beneficiary

table of contents our financial position 
however  sfas had an impact on the presentation of our results of operations for the year ended march  risk factors we may not be able to compete effectively in the market for data center services 
the market for data center services is extremely competitive and subject to rapid technological change 
our current and potential competitors include providers of data center services  global  regional and local telecommunications companies and regional bell operating companies  and information technology outsourcing firms 
many of our existing competitors have greater market presence and financial and personnel resources than we do 
our competitors include internet data centers operated by established communications carriers such as at t  level  mci and qwest 
we also compete with providers of data services centers  regional bell operating companies that offer internet access and information technology outsourcing firms 
the principal competitive factors in our market include ability to deliver services when requested by the customer  internet system engineering and other professional services expertise  customer service  network capability  reliability  quality of service and scalability  variety of managed services offered  access to network resources  including circuits  equipment and interconnection capacity to other networks  broad geographic presence  price  ability to maintain and expand distribution channels  brand name recognition  timing of introductions of new services  physical and network security  financial resources  and customer base 
some of our competitors may be able to develop and expand their data center services faster  devote greater resources to the marketing and sale of their products and adopt more aggressive pricing policies than we can 
in addition  these competitors have entered and will likely continue to enter into business relationships to provide additional services that compete with the services we provide 
we anticipate that an increasing portion of our revenues will be from contracts with agencies of the united states government  and uncertainties in government contracts could adversely affect our business 
generally  us government contracts are subject to oversight audits by government representatives  to profit and cost controls and limitations  and to provisions permitting modification or termination  in whole or in part  without prior notice  at the government s convenience 
in some cases  government contracts are subject to the uncertainties surrounding congressional appropriations or agency funding 
government contracts are subject to specific procurement regulations 
failure to comply with these regulations and requirements could lead to suspension or debarment from future government contracting for a period of time 

table of contents we have significant debt service obligations which will require the use of a substantial portion of our available cash 
on a proforma basis after the issuance of our million in senior notes due june   and application of the proceeds from the issuance  our total liabilities are approximately million  obligations guaranteed by us were million and our total shareholders equity was million 
each of these obligations requires significant amounts of liquidity 
should we need additional capital or financing  our ability to arrange financing and the cost of this financing will depend upon many factors  including general economic and capital markets conditions  and in particular the non investment grade debt market  conditions in the internet infrastructure market  credit availability from banks or other lenders  investor confidence in the telecommunications industry generally and our company specifically  and the success of our facilities 
we are dependent on key personnel and the loss of these key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our success 
we are highly dependent on the services of key personnel  particularly manuel d 
medina  our chairman 
in an attempt to reduce costs  we have eliminated some management positions 
our potential growth and expansion and the merger and integration of separate businesses  are expected to place increased demands on our management skills and resources 
therefore  our success also depends upon our ability to hire and retain additional skilled and experienced management personnel 
employment and retention of qualified personnel is important due to the competitive nature of our industry 
if we do not locate financial or strategic partners  we may have to delay or abandon expansion plans 
expenditures commence well before a terrenap center opens  and it may take an extended period to approach break even capacity utilization 
it takes a significant period of time to select the appropriate location for a new terrenap center  construct the necessary facilities  install equipment and telecommunications infrastructure and hire operations and sales personnel 
as a result  we expect that individual terrenap centers will experience losses for more than one year from the time they are opened 
as a part of our terrenap center strategy  we intend to rely on third party financial or strategic partners to fund the development costs 
if we are unable to establish such third party relationships  we may delay or abandon some or all of our development and expansion plans or otherwise forego market opportunities  making it difficult for us to generate additional revenue and to respond to competitive pressures 
our president  chairman and chief executive officer  cannot be removed without cause which could delay  defer or prevent change in control of our company or impede a merger  consolidation  takeover or other business combination 
under the terms of our agreement with manuel d 
medina  our president  chairman and chief executive officer  as long as mr 
medina s guarantees of our debt exist  we have agreed to nominate mr 
medina to our board of directors and not remove mr 
medina  unless for good cause  or remove any of our officers without mr 
medina s consent 
this could delay  defer or prevent change in control of our company or impede a merger  consolidation  takeover or other business combination that you  as a stockholder  may otherwise view favorably 

table of contents if the price of our shares remains low or our financial condition deteriorates  we may be delisted by the american stock exchange 
our common stock currently trades on the american stock exchange amex 
the amex requires companies to fulfill specific requirements in order for their shares to continue to be listed 
our securities may be considered for delisting if our financial condition and operating results appear to be unsatisfactory  it appears that the extent of public distribution or the aggregate market value of the securities has become so reduced as to make further dealings on the amex inadvisable  or we have sustained losses which are so substantial in relation to our overall operations or our existing financial condition has become so impaired that it appears questionable whether we will be able to continue operations and or meet our obligations as they mature 
for example  the amex may consider suspension or delisting of a stock if the stock has been selling for a substantial period of time at a low price per share 
our common stock has been trading at relatively low prices for the past eighteen months and we have sustained net losses for the past three fiscal years 
therefore  our common stock is at risk of being delisted by the amex 
if our shares are delisted from the amex  our stockholders could find it difficult to sell our stock 
to date we have had no communication from the amex regarding delisting 
if our common stock is delisted from the amex  we may apply to have our shares quoted on nasdaq s bulletin board or in the pink sheets maintained by the national quotation bureau  inc the bulletin board and the pink sheets are generally considered to be less efficient markets than the amex 
in addition  if our shares are no longer listed on the amex or another national securities exchange in the united states  our shares may be subject to the penny stock regulations 
if our common stock were to become subject to the penny stock rules it is likely that the price of our common stock would decline and that our stockholders would find it difficult to sell their shares 
our business could be harmed by prolonged electrical power outages or shortages  or increased costs of energy 
our nap facilities are susceptible to regional costs of power  electrical power shortages and planned or unplanned power outages caused by these shortages 
a power shortage may result in an increase of the cost of energy  which we may not be able to pass on to our customers 
we attempt to limit exposure to system downtime by using backup generators and power supplies 
power outages  which last beyond our backup and alternative power arrangements  could harm our customers and our business 
brazilian political and economic conditions may have an adverse impact on our operations 
our results of operations and financial condition may be affected by inflation in each country in which we manage a facility 
we maintain operations in brazil  which has had in the past  and may have now or in the future  a highly inflationary economy  defined as cumulative inflation of about or more over a three calendar year period 
future increases in our costs may exceed the rate of inflation or the amounts  if any  which we may be able to recover rom our customers 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have not entered into any financial instruments for trading or hedging purposes 
our carrying values of cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  accounts payable and accrued expenses is a reasonable approximation of their fair value 
our exposure to market risk resulting from changes in interest rates relates primarily to our debt 
an immediate increase or decrease in current interest rates would furthermore not have a material impact on our debt obligations due to the fixed nature of our debt obligations 
the fair market value of our long term fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk 
generally  the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt 
table of contents will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
these interest rate changes may affect the fair market value of the fixed interest rate debt but do not impact our earnings or cash flows 
to date  over of our recognized revenue has been denominated in us dollars  generated mostly from customers in the us  and our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations has been minimal 
in the future  a larger portion of our revenues may be derived from operations outside of the us and may be denominated in foreign currency 
as a result  future operating results or cash flows could be impacted due to currency fluctuations relative to the us dollar 
furthermore  to the extent we engage in international sales that are denominated in us dollars  an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our services less competitive in the international markets 
although we will continue to monitor our exposure to currency fluctuations  and when appropriate  may use financial hedging techniques in the future to minimize the effect of these fluctuations  we cannot conclude that exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our financial results in the future 
some of our operating costs are subject to price fluctuations caused by the volatility of underlying commodity prices 
the commodity most likely to have an impact on our results of operations in the event of significant price change is electricity 
we are closely monitoring the cost of electricity 
to the extent that electricity costs rise  we are investigating opportunities to pass these additional power costs onto our customers that utilize this power 
we do not employ forward contracts or other financial instruments to hedge commodity price risk
