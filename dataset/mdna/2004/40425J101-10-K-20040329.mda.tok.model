accordis provides business office outsourcing services for hospitals  emergency medical transport agencies  and other healthcare providers 
these business office services may include identifying third party resources  submitting timely and accurate bills to third party payors and patients  recovering and properly accounting for the amounts due  responding to customer service questions from patients  and securing the appropriate cost based reimbursement from entitlement programs 
clients may outsource the entirety of their business office operations to us  or discrete components of the revenue cycle 
healthcare reform and regulatory matters the healthcare reimbursement landscape continues to evolve 
federal  state  and local governments  as well as other third party payors  continue their efforts to reduce the rate of growth in healthcare expenditures 
many of these policy initiatives have contributed to the complex and time consuming nature of obtaining healthcare reimbursement for medical services 

table of contents hospitals are subject to comprehensive federal and state regulation  which affects hospital reimbursement 
medicaid and medicare account for a significant portion of hospital revenue 
since adoption  the medicaid and medicare programs have undergone significant and frequent changes  and it is realistic to expect additional changes in the future 
our services are subject to regulations pertaining to billing for medicaid and medicare services  which primarily involve record keeping requirements and other provisions designed to prevent fraud 
we believe that we operate in a manner consistent with such regulations  the enforcement of which is increasingly more stringent 
violations of such regulations could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the medicare program is administered by the center for medicare and medicaid services cms  an agency of the united states department of health and human services 
cms currently contracts with several intermediaries and fiscal agents to process regional claims for reimbursement 
although cms has established the regulatory framework for medicare claims administration  medicare intermediaries have the authority to develop independent procedures for administering the claims reimbursement process 
the medicaid program is subject to regulation by cms  but is administered by state governments 
state governments provide for medicaid claims reimbursement either through the establishment of state operated processing centers or through contractual arrangements with third party fiscal agents who operate their own processing centers 
the requirements and procedures for reimbursement implemented by medicaid differ from state to state 
similar to the claims administration processes of medicare and medicaid  many national health insurance companies and self insured employers adjudicate claims through local or regional offices 
consequently  because guidelines for the reimbursement of claims are generally established by third party payors at local or regional levels  hospital and other provider reimbursement managers must remain current with the local procedures and requirements of third party payors 
generally  we are required to maintain standards of confidentiality that are comparable to those of an agency administering the medicare or medicaid program when we use data obtained from such programs 
the health insurance portability and accountability act of requires the secretary of health and human services to adopt national standards for certain types of electronic health information transactions and the data elements used in such transactions and to adopt standards to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of health information 
all covered entities providers  payors  and clearinghouses will be mandated to implement administrative  physical  and technical safeguards to protect health data covered by hipaa 
the regulations are in the following stages of finalization and implementation transaction and code set standards 
the final regulation governing transaction and code set standards was published and was expected to become effective on october  however  on december  the administrative simplification compliance act asca was enacted providing for a one year extension of the date for complying with the hipaa standard transactions and code set requirements for any covered entity that submits to the secretary of health and human services a plan on how the entity will come into compliance with the requirements by october  we submitted such a plan to be in full compliance with the standard transaction and code set requirements by the october  deadline 
as of october   however  a number of providers  payors and clearinghouses were still not ready to submit and or accept certain standard transactions 
cms  as well as a number of fiscal intermediaries and other payors  announced transition time periods during which legacy transaction and code set formats would still be accepted  albeit for a limited time only 
in these instances  as applicable  we continue to test with those trading partners operating under transition plans and expect to be fully compliant by the time the transition time periods expire 
privacy regulation 
the privacy regulation was published as a final regulation and became effective on april   requiring all covered entities to be fully compliant by april  the final changes to the hipaa privacy rule were published in the federal register on august  the april   compliance date was not changed  although the date by which covered entities must have business associate agreements in place was  under certain circumstances  extended beyond april we believe we were in full compliance with the privacy regulation by the april  deadline and continue to be compliant 
data security 
the data security regulation was published as a final regulation on february   with an effective date of april  full compliance is required two years after the effective date 

table of contents any material restriction on the ability of healthcare providers and payors to obtain or disseminate health information could adversely affect our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
with the release of the final hipaa privacy and security rules  the protection of individually identifiable healthcare information becomes a key component of the way we and other covered entities perform our day to day business 
on january   we announced that we had received a subpoena from the united states attorney s office for the southern district of new york in connection with an investigation under the health insurance portability and accountability act of relating to possible federal health care offenses

principal products and services accordis accordis offers hospitals  emergency medical transport providers and other healthcare providers business office outsourcing services and reimbursement services 
business office outsourcing services 
our business office outsourcing services encompass all or a portion of the patient accounting activities that make up a healthcare provider s revenue cycle 
such revenue cycle activities may include third party resource identification and validation  submission of timely and accurate bills to primary and secondary payors  generation of patient statements  response to patient and third party questions  recovery of payments due  and proper accounting for payments  contractual allowances and write offs 
these services are designed to increase the provider s revenue  improve the proportion of provider gross charges ultimately collected  accelerate cash flow  lower days in accounts receivable  and reduce administrative costs 
a client may outsource one or more aspects of its patient accounting processes or may outsource the business office in its entirety 
in some cases  our services are used by providers who need assistance in liquidating aged or complex accounts 
at the request of a client  we are also able to provide bad debt collection services through a wholly owned subsidiary 
emergency medical transport provider services 
we offer our clients a combination of technology  data processing capacity  and revenue cycle expertise to assist ambulance providers in improving cash flow and reducing the cost to bill and collect 
accordis applies its revenue management expertise to ensure optimal reimbursement for all types of ambulance service providers hospital based  private  and municipal  reducing the significant administrative burden of billing third parties and patients 
we utilize our proprietary accessline system to track all liquidation activity associated with ambulance accounts  and provide clients with real time access to account information 
reimbursement services 
our reimbursement services ensure that healthcare providers correctly document services which qualify for special reimbursement through the medicare cost report and other governmental payment mechanisms 
coinsurance and deductible balances constitute a significant and growing component of medicare reimbursement 
the federal government recognizes that these balances often remain uncollected  and allows for a cost report adjustment to claim these amounts as bad debt expense  however  the reporting requirements are very demanding 
our medicare bad debt reporting service accurately documents qualifying balances and assists clients in supplying all documentation required for governmental audit 
since  medicare has allowed hospitals serving a disproportionate share of low income patients to claim additional federal reimbursement to offset the expense of serving this population 
again  the reporting requirements are significant  and require an increasing amount of reconciliation between the hospital s own records and government systems 
our disproportionate share reporting service assists hospitals in qualifying for reimbursement under this program  through the medicare cost report related filings and professional support during audits 
the enrollment of uninsured patients in medicaid programs is an important component of the registration process for providers who serve the uninsured 
our medicaid application services unit works at the front end of the healthcare process to evaluate patients for potential medicaid eligibility  and to provide support throughout the application process 
these services positively impact hospitals cash flow  
table of contents as well as enabling providers to ensure complete reimbursement under programs such as disproportionate share 
hospitals that support medical education programs contribute substantially to the advancement of the medical field  but incur significant incremental expenses as a result 
the medicare indirect medical education ime program allows providers to claim incremental reimbursement for these expenses 
through reporting and claim development  we help providers to meet the reporting requirements of this program 
health management systems health management systems offers a variety of services that help government healthcare entitlement programs  most notably state medicaid agencies  contain costs and recover revenue 
to date  these revenue recoveries total more than billion a milestone we surpassed in october our services derive from the complexity of medicaid and other healthcare entitlement programs  and the many rules that govern relationships among them 
established in  medicaid is administered by individual states  and is jointly funded by the federal and state governments 
because medicaid is the payor of last resort  the federal government imposed statutory obligations in the early s requiring states to actively recover payments made on behalf of beneficiaries who have other forms of third party health insurance 
in  health management systems began offering state medicaid agencies services to identify third parties with prior liability for medicaid claims 
using proprietary information management techniques  we have developed methodologies that generally include the following steps identification we use proprietary software to match medicaid and other program data files to insurance eligibility files obtained by us from third parties such as medicare  commercial insurers  hmos  third party administrators  tricare  and others 
this process identifies potential third party eligibility 
validation after identification of potential third party liability  we validate insurance eligibility by verifying coverage for specific benefits 
this process is performed by deploying automated electronic transactions and call center representatives recovery when eligibility and coverage are in effect for a specific medicaid member and related episode of care  we pursue recovery of the medicaid payment from the liable third party 
most often we recover from third parties through direct billing of insurers or disallowance of overpayments to the provider of services 
on occasion  we recover payments through negotiated settlements 
cost avoidance upon verification of coverage or payment of claims by liable third parties  we electronically submit this coverage data to our medicaid clients 
this data is used to avoid paying similar claims for the medicaid member on a going forward basis 
these proprietary information management techniques and methodologies are the foundation for our suite of coordination of benefits cob services among government programs and other sources of healthcare coverage 
specifically cobconnectsm identifies third party payment sources eg  commercial insurance plans  medicare  the department of defense tricare program  and recovers public health plan expenditures when third party liability exists 
cobconnect also includes the identification and recovery of accident related medical costs where a casualty insurer should pay in lieu of medicaid  or where a deceased beneficiary s estate should reimburse medicaid 

table of contents cobplus pharmacy services identifies and recovers pharmacy expenditures by medicaid and other state funded pharmacy programs in cases where third party liability exists 
cobconnectsm kids provides comprehensive medical support enforcement  helping state medicaid and child support enforcement agencies identify health plan coverage available to children through their non custodial or custodial parents 
health management systems then provides assistance with health plan enrollment 
in addition  health management systems offers overpayment recovery services  which identify and recover excess payments for healthcare services  payments made in error  duplicate payments  and other inappropriate payments 
revenue full actualization services  which help ensure that states receive the full amount of federal healthcare and human service funding to which they are entitled

health management systems clients primarily consist of government healthcare and human services agencies within state and county governments 
we also serve managed care plans that work with these agencies 
typically  clients award contracts for three to five year terms  and we receive contingency fees calculated as a percentage of the amounts recovered 
we now have contracts with states 
our largest client is the los angeles county department of health services in california

in many instances  we provide our services pursuant to agreements subject to competitive re procurement 
all of these agreements expire between and we cannot provide any assurance that any of these agreements will be renewed and  if renewed  that the fee rates will be equal to those currently in effect 
market trends opportunities accordis a number of factors are forcing healthcare providers to manage their patient accounts more efficiently 
although the aggregate medicare and medicaid funding received by hospitals may be growing  federal and state healthcare cost control initiatives are acting to reduce the proportion of medicare and medicaid classified hospital 
table of contents charges that are reimbursed by government sources 
the coordination of benefits associated with ongoing changes to the eligibility for  and coverage available under  governmental  managed care  and commercial insurance programs is increasingly complex 
the rising underinsured and uninsured populations pose a significant challenge especially to public hospitals  which comprise a considerable portion of our client base 
as providers deliver increasingly more services in outpatient settings  their accounts receivable portfolios have become skewed toward high volume  low balance accounts  creating significantly more work for the business office staff 
with the increasing complexity of the healthcare reimbursement environment and shortages of qualified labor in many areas  it is more and more difficult for an individual provider institution to maintain in house the expertise required to operate patient accounting functions 
as a result of these pressures  and as well to reduce cost  providers are now engaging outside help at an earlier stage in the revenue cycle and are seeking help in executing more of the functions of their business offices 
a number have entirely outsourced the management of their patient accounting functions  as they seek to focus limited management and financial resources on the delivery of patient care 
we offer providers a cost effective outsourcing alternative by virtue of our specialized workforce  through which we offer business office expertise  aptitude with patient accounting technology based tools  extensive knowledge of federal  state  and local health regulations and experience in dealing with government agencies  commercial insurance companies  and others involved in administering medical assistance or insurance programs 
health management systems health management systems business is defined by the nation s expensive and complex system of government funded healthcare including entitlement programs such as medicaid  medicare  and programs administered by the veterans administration  the department of defense  and the public health service 
in addition  state governments operate their own programs to address the healthcare needs of their citizens 
several factors drive the financial characteristics of this market the hierarchy of programs and payors  the shared funding of programs between federal and state governments varying by state and program  the funding mechanisms the government budget and appropriations process  and the steadily rising cost of healthcare in the country 
in  government programs accounted for  or billion  of the trillion spent on healthcare in the united states  according to cms 
since then  government healthcare spending  especially for medicaid  has only increased 
more americans have enrolled in the medicaid program  bringing the total number of beneficiaries to million 
for fiscal year medicaid spending is expected to reach billion  making medicaid the largest healthcare payor in the country even more than medicare with projected spending of billion 
as these programs have grown  so too has the need for proper coordination of benefits 
recent cms data show that of medicare claims were inappropriately paid in fiscal year representing billion in spending 
and as much as of medicaid expenditures are estimated to result from errors or payments where third party liability existed 
since  the weak economy has reduced state tax revenues  creating budget shortfalls that will total more than billion in fiscal year  according to the kaiser commission on medicaid and the uninsured 
medicaid is the second largest expenditure for states and has become a natural target for budget cutting 
indeed  all states implemented medicaid cost containment measures in fiscal year despite these efforts  medicaid spending grew over the previous year  and each state has planned similar cost containment measures for furthermore  the much publicized enactment of a medicare prescription drug benefit may complicate the coordination of benefits between the program and medicaid 
beginning in  the new legislation will make medicare responsible for drug costs that previously were paid through medicaid 
while alleviating some of the financial burdens for states  however  the legislation also creates new administrative responsibilities for them 
these responsibilities  combined with clawback payments that states will be required to make to the federal government  will offset much of the medicaid cost savings 
in fact  the congressional budget office estimates that the medicare law may actually increase state medicaid spending over the next several years

the complaint alleged that the defendants caused hhl to make substantial unjustified payments to us which  ultimately  led to defaults on the notes and to hhl s filing for chapter bankruptcy protection in the plaintiffs sought damages in the amount of million for the unpaid notes plus interest 
as a result of motion practice before the bankruptcy court  the breach of fiduciary duty claim was dismissed

if the government declines to intervene  the private litigant may independently pursue the case against the healthcare provider 
in the course of discussions with the united states attorney s office  we learned that a qui tam lawsuit has been filed against us in the us district court for the southern district of new york 
because the qui tam complaint remains sealed  we have not had any opportunity to review its allegations 
we believe  however  that it is likely that the complaint primarily relates to the matters covered by the government s subpoena

 revenue recognition in financial statements sab  we elected early adoption for our fiscal year ended october   implementing a change in accounting in regard to revenue generated from clients seeking reimbursement from third party payors where our fees are contingent upon the client s collections from third parties 
as of november   we recognized revenue pertaining to such clients once the third party payor remitted payment to its client

see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies revenue recognition 
we principally recognize revenue for our service offerings when third party payors remit payment to the our customers 
this policy is in effect because our fees are principally contingent upon our customers collections from third parties 
due to this revenue recognition policy  our operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter because of the timing of such collections by our customers and the fact that a significant portion of our operating expenses are fixed 
accounting for income taxes 
we have incurred net operating losses for tax purposes during the last five years prior to the year ended december   resulting in cumulative federal net operating loss carry forwards of million as of december  in addition to other items expensed for financial reporting purposes that were 
table of contents not currently deductible for tax purposes  these net operating loss carryforwards result in gross deferred tax assets 
we must assess the likelihood that the gross deferred tax assets  net of any deferred tax liabilities  will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe the recovery is not likely  we have established a valuation allowance 
significant management judgment is required in determining this valuation allowance 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of million as of december   due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of our net deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain net operating loss carry forwards before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimate of taxable income and the period over which the net deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that these estimates differ or we adjust these estimates in future periods we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
conversely  if we are profitable in the future at levels which cause management to conclude that it is more likely than not that we will realize all or a portion of the net deferred tax assets  for which a valuation is currently provided  we would record the estimated net realizable value of the net deferred tax asset at that time and would then provide income taxes at a rate equal to our combined federal and state effective rate of approximately 
the net deferred tax asset as of december  was million  which is net of a valuation allowance of million 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill 
goodwill  representing the excess of acquisition costs over the fair value of net assets of acquired businesses  is not amortized but is reviewed for impairment at least annually and written down only in the periods in which it is determined that the recorded value is greater than the fair value 
for the purposes of performing this impairment test  our business segments are our reporting units 
the fair values of those reporting units  to which goodwill has been assigned  is compared with their recorded values 
if recorded values are less than the fair values  no impairment is indicated 
no impairment loss resulted from the initial goodwill impairment test in  or from the annual impairment tests that were performed during and goodwill acquired in business combinations completed before july  had been amortized through december  on a straight line basis over a period of ten to forty years 
long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
we determine the recoverability of the carrying value of our long lived assets based on a projection of the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset 
when we determine that the carrying value of long lived assets may not be recoverable  we measure any impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the asset with the fair value of the asset 
for identifiable intangibles  we determine fair value based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate reflective of our cost of funds 
estimating valuation allowances and accrued liabilities  such as bad debts  and restructuring charges 
the preparation of financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
specifically  management must make estimates of the uncollectability of our accounts receivable 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable and analyzes historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful 
table of contents accounts 
the accounts receivable balance was million  net of allowance for doubtful accounts of million as of december  management has estimated a certain amount of charges as of december  related to restructuring activities 
we have recorded an estimated liability based on a reasonable assessment of the probable costs to be incurred 
as additional information becomes available  we may revise the estimates 
such revisions in estimates of the potential restructuring liabilities could materially impact the results of operation and financial position 
discontinued operations 
the accompanying financial statements are prepared using discontinued operations accounting for our discontinued dsg and psg businesses 
under discontinued operations accounting  amounts are accrued for estimates of our expected liabilities related to discontinued operations through their eventual discharge 
in july  we determined to proceed with an orderly closure of psg by accelerating a wind down of its remaining operations 
the dsg business was sold in december at december   there were no remaining liabilities of the discontinued operations and any adjustments related to costs to be incurred during the close down or losses from operations  have been reflected in the and as discontinued operations 
in the event that any liabilities should arise from these discontinued operations  there could be a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this form k contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
strategic review in late fiscal year  we began a strategic examination of our operating businesses and general business strategies to implement a focused business plan  divest non strategic assets and reduce infrastructure and overhead costs 
at the end of calendar year  we completed our strategic review and are now organized around two core businesses  accordis and health management systems  with a business plan focused on growing revenues and increasing profitability 
as a consequence of the strategic review  we incurred restructuring charges  discontinued operating two business segments  one through closure and one through sale  and divested certain non strategic assets as follows divestitures and monetization of non strategic assets as a fundamental element of the strategic review  we completed the following divestitures sale of edi business 
in january  we sold our electronic transaction processing edi business  consisting of substantially all the assets of our wholly owned subsidiary  quality medi cal adjudication  incorporated  and certain assets of its wholly owned subsidiary  health receivables management  inc the sale price of million resulted in a pre tax loss of  this business was a commodity billing service  and we determined the service was more appropriately purchased from specialized external vendors 
sale of cdr business 
in july  we sold our credit balance audit business through the sale of substantially all the assets of our wholly owned subsidiary  cdr associates  inc the sale price of million resulted in pre tax gain of million 
the business was not core to our technology based third party liability processing business  and consequently we sought to monetize this non strategic asset through its sale 
sale of health care microsystems  inc in december  we sold our wholly owned subsidiary  health care microsystems  inc which operated as our decision support group 
the sale price of million resulted in a pre tax gain of million 
we had originally entered the software business in through our merger with hcm  
table of contents a company that furnished microcomputer based distributed decision support software systems and consulting services to healthcare providers and payors 
we determined this business was not critical to our strategy of providing business office outsourcing services 
as this business was a separate reportable segment  representing a separate class of customer and major business  its operating results are presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
closure of payor systems group 
our payor systems group  which consisted of health information systems corporation and its sole operating subsidiary  health systems architects  inc  furnished various information technology based consulting and other services  and software products to managed care organizations 
in march  the psg business received notification from its development partner  canceling their participation in our managed care system development initiative 
as a consequence  we recognized a restructuring charge of million and an asset impairment charge of million associated with the psg business 
later in june the psg business received a cancellation notice from its largest customer 
in light of these events  we determined to proceed with an orderly closure of psg by accelerating a wind down of its remaining operations 
as this business was a separate reportable segment  representing a separate class of customer and major business  its operating results are presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
restructuring charges  asset impairments  and other items in addition to the business divestitures and closure discussed above  we incurred several other charges resulting from the strategic review of our business operations  infrastructure  and management team 
in particular in april  we incurred a restructuring charge of  for facility exit costs and employee severance costs associated with the closure of our washington  dc office 
throughout  we incurred million in compensation costs for severance and retention bonuses that were paid during the year  resulting from our divestiture efforts and headcount reduction efforts 
in december  we incurred a restructuring charge of million consisting of  for severance costs associated with reductions in the information technology and facilities maintenance departments  and million for facility exit costs associated with a plan to reduce the amount of office space we occupy at our headquarters in new york city 
this office space reduction effort culminated in our executing a sublease in january  resulting in an additional restructuring charge of  in december for facility exit costs 
in december  we increased this restructuring charge by  reflecting higher than estimated real estate taxes 
in december  we recognized a charge of million for the impairment of goodwill resulting from the acquisition of the global business unit 
current overview following the strategic review discussed above during we have focused on our two operating businesses  health management systems and accordis 
our goals have been to strengthen the operational management teams  improve and further develop our service delivery capabilities  clarify our targeted customer bases and how best to reach those audiences  increase revenue through new client acquisition and expansion of opportunities with existing clients  rationalize our cost structure  and develop long term strategies for the future of the businesses 
we believe at this time that these initiatives have been largely completed and we are focused on continued revenue growth and client acquisition  superior execution of service delivery  and on going maintenance of the appropriate strategic agendas for the future 

table of contents revenue considerations a macro economic factor in our health management systems business is the rising cost of healthcare and the rising cost of entitlement programs such as medicaid 
medicaid has grown on average approximately per year over the last several years  while currently state budgets nationwide are under increasing strain due to decreasing revenues reflecting the status of the overall national economy and increasing state expenditures 
in light of these circumstances and consistent with national business trends  state governments are more receptive to engaging vendors to help in coordination of benefits and cost containment activities 
this serves as another underlying factor in the opportunity in our marketplace for revenue growth 
what remains unknown is whether health management systems will be successful in the awarding of these contracts 
an ongoing uncertainty in the health management systems marketplace is the increased government scrutiny of entitlement programs such as medicaid and the continuing national dialogue on reforming the country s healthcare system 
our accordis business also benefits from the increase in healthcare spending over the last several years 
healthcare providers and in particular hospitals face a more difficult financial climate as costs increase at a disproportionate rate with reimbursements from both managed care payors and entitlement programs 
consistent with national business trends toward outsourcing  we expect to see an increase in the opportunity for business office outsourcing with healthcare providers as they focus on managing their cost infrastructures by focusing on their core missions and examining opportunities to decrease costs in non core activities 
what remains unknown is whether and how quickly healthcare providers  primarily hospitals  will act on outsourcing their businesses offices and whether accordis will be a successful vendor in securing such contracts 
during the last few years accordis has experienced substantial success providing specialized reimbursement services to hospitals 
these services consist of medicare bad debt reporting  disproportionate share reporting  medicaid application services  and medicare indirect medical education program reimbursement 
also  during the last two years accordis has experienced substantial success providing revenue cycle management services to emergency medical transport providers in the form of technology based billing and collection services designed to optimize reimbursement  improve cash flow and reduce the cost to perform these functions 
what remains unknown is whether accordis can continue to maintain this level of success in the marketplace with its reimbursement and emergency medical transport provider services 
most of our client engagements are unique in their scope and the particular needs and environment of the client  as a consequence  we do not have general key performance indicators for our two businesses that we use to measure their success 
however  within each client engagement there are specific metrics and goals that management measures to monitor performance and success against client and our own expectations 
almost all of our business is on a contingency fee basis where we recognize revenue only after our client has received payment from a third party 
in addition  many of the services we perform in both our businesses are project based in nature  which often recur on an annual basis  but do not necessarily recur on a monthly or quarterly basis 
this can lead to significant quarterly variations in revenue and operating results  as our operating expenses are largely fixed on a quarter to quarter basis 
see a more detailed discussion in the risk factors section  below 
operating expenses at the beginning of  as a final element to the strategic review and focus on our two core remaining operating businesses  we implemented a corporate re organization  placing the health management systems and accordis operations into separate corporate entities and creating hms business services as a provider of data processing and general and administrative services to these two operating businesses 
this action has provided for greater operational and financial management of the two businesses with improved clarity on the financial relationships in each business and their respective operating results  including the charges for services provided by the shared services entity 
as a service company  to of our operating expenses are compensation 
we adjust our employee headcount based on known business needs and current expectations about the near term future 
based on recent 
table of contents operating results  compensation expense tends to grow with increases in revenue although not on a directly corresponding basis since many employee functions do not require additional staff as revenue increases 
direct project expenses are incurred based on the requirements of particular client engagements and have averaged approximately to of revenues on an annual basis  with quarterly fluctuations of plus or minus occupancy and data processing expenses have not been substantially impacted by our growth in revenue over the past couple of years 
these are largely infrastructure costs that would only be effected by significant changes in the business  either dramatic growth or shrinkage  or a dramatic change in our operational delivery model 
other operating expenses reflect certain costs of doing business such as insurance  legal fees  accounting and tax fees  and costs associated with the requirements of being a publicly traded company 
other significant components of this category of expense are business expenses for other external professional services based on the needs of the operating business  travel and entertainment expenses  employee recruiting  training and activity costs  and miscellaneous office expenses 
operating results aside from the discussion above regarding revenue fluctuations due to our revenue recognition policy and the project nature of some of our revenues  our operating expenses can increase based on discrete spending activities such as the legal fees we incurred in related to the investigation by the united states attorney s office 
similarly  in the first half of  we continued to incur costs related to two discretionary initiatives  that were subsequently cancelled 
one of the initiatives was a new service development effort and the other was a data processing system reconfiguration effort  both of which increased our compensation  data processing and other operating costs expense categories 

table of contents years ended december  and continuing operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain items in our consolidated statements of operations expressed as a percentage of revenue years ended december  revenue cost of services compensation data processing occupancy direct project costs other operating costs restructuring costs total cost of services operating income loss net interest income income loss from continuing operations before income taxes income taxes income loss from continuing operations income from discontinued operations net income revenue for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million or compared to revenue of million in the prior fiscal year ended december  health management systems  which provides third party liability identification and recovery services to state medicaid agencies  generated revenue of million in  a million or increase over the prior year revenue of million 
this increase primarily reflected  of revenue during the current year from two new state clients and million related to the expansion of services for an existing client 
in addition  revenue increased by million across the comparable client base reflecting specific non recurring revenue opportunities with certain clients based on their particular needs  differences in the timing of when client projects were completed in the current year compared with the prior year  and changes in the volume  yields and scope of client projects 
non recurring revenue opportunities are generally situations where we have an opportunity to earn additional revenue from a client which we do not expect will recur in the current year or which did not exist in the prior year 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in revenue resulting from the termination of two client relationships in the prior year 
accordis  which provides outsourced business office services for hospitals  generated revenue of million in  a  or increase from the prior year revenue of million 
this increase primarily consisted of million of revenue from four new customers since the prior year period and a million increase with four customers resulting from an expansion in the scope of services provided 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in revenue of million across the comparable client base reflecting specific non recurring revenue opportunities with certain clients based on their particular needs  differences in the timing of when client projects were completed in the current year compared with the prior year  and changes in the volume  yields and 
table of contents scope of client projects 
there was also a reduction in revenue of million associated with terminated or inactive customer relationships 
these decreases in revenue across the comparable client base and the decrease associated with terminated or inactive client relationships include an estimated permanent revenue loss in the second quarter of million attributable to processing delays and other impacts of the redirection of operational resources to regulatory matters 
see part i item legal proceedings 
operating expenses as a percentage of revenue were in the current year compared to in the prior year and for were million  an increase of  or  compared to prior year operating expenses of million 
the increased operating expenses in were principally due to the increases in revenue in both of the operating businesses 
as discussed below in more detail  legal fees associated with our response to the subpoena from the united states attorney s office were substantially offset by several non recurring charges in compensation expense as a percentage of revenue was in the current year compared to in the prior year and for was million  an increase of million  or from the prior year period expense of million 
this dollar increase resulted from general increases in compensation rates and the cost of employee benefits 
at december   we had employees  compared to employees at december  the current year headcount and related compensation expense reflects a shift to service center employees for the provision of business outsourcing services from higher paid information technology employees 
data processing expense as a percentage of revenue was in the current fiscal year compared to in the prior fiscal year and for was million  a decrease of million or compared to the prior year expense of million 
the prior year costs included million associated with service development and system enhancement and reconfiguration activities that were terminated in the second quarter of  including a charge of  for the disposal and impairment of hardware and software items 
occupancy expense as a percentage of revenue was in the current year compared to in the prior year and for was million  a decrease of  or from the prior year expense of million 
this net decrease reflects subletting one floor at our new york city headquarters  partially offset by nominal increases in rent and other occupancy expenses 
direct project expense as a percentage of revenue was in the current year compared to in the prior year and for was million  an increase of million or from the prior fiscal year expense of million 
this increase reflects a  increase in expense related to accordis  and a  increase in expense related to health management systems 
the accordis increase was principally due to increased subcontractor expenses of million and  of increased mailing costs partially offset by a  reduction in professional fees based on the particular mix of client engagements 
the increase related to health management systems is consistent with a increase in revenues 
other operating expenses as a percentage of revenue were in the current year compared to in the prior year and for were million  an increase of  or compared to the prior year expense of million 
this net increase resulted from million in expenses primarily for legal fees associated with our response to the subpoena from the united states attorney s office and increased insurance costs of  which were partially offset by a decrease of million primarily for consulting and professional service fees associated with a service development initiative and a system reconfiguration effort  both of which were terminated in the second quarter in   of expense in the prior year period related to certain stock option grants to members of the board of directors  and a reduction in all other expenses of restructuring costs as a percentage of revenue were in the current year compared to in the prior year and in were  a decrease of  from restructuring costs in reflect an  restructuring charge associated with reducing the amount of office space we occupy at our headquarters in 
table of contents new york city based on an executed sublease and an additional  in facility exit costs associated with the closure of our washington  dc office 
in  restructuring charges reflect an additional  associated with higher than estimated real estate taxes on sublet office space 
operating income for the year ended december  was million compared to an operating loss of million for the prior year 
the accordis operating loss was million for the year ended december  compared to an operating loss of million in the prior year 
health management systems had an operating profit of million for the year ended december  compared to an operating profit of million in the prior year 
the decrease in the accordis operating loss largely reflects several non recurring items in including million in expenses for service development initiatives and system enhancement and reconfiguration activities partially offset by the million in expenses primarily for legal fees associated with the investigation by the united states attorney s office 
the increase in health management systems operating profitability largely reflects the increase in revenue discussed above 
in and  we did not recognize any income tax benefit expense against our income loss from continuing operations or the income from discontinued operations 
we have incurred significant taxable losses the last several years 
most of our deferred income tax assets are in the form of net operating loss carry forwards 
a recoverability analysis was performed based on our recent taxable loss history and projections of future taxable operating results 
net interest income of  in fiscal year compared with  in the prior year reflects a shift to shorter term investments and a reduction in market interest rates 
income from continuing operations was million in the current year compared with a loss of million in the prior year 
the million increase in income largely reflects the reduction of non recurring charges  restructuring charges  asset impairments and asset write offs during the current fiscal year discussed above as well as the effects of increased revenue  particularly in our health management systems business 
discontinued operations as more fully discussed in part item business  note b and note b of the notes to consolidated financial statements  we reported the results of psg and dsg as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
income from discontinued operations in of million was principally attributable to a million termination fee which was not included in the original loss on disposal estimate for psg  a reduction in the estimated loss on disposal of psg of  based on actual operating results  and  resulting from the favorable resolution of certain dsg operating liabilities 
income from discontinued operations for psg in of  reflects the actual operating results for that period which were not previously included in the estimated loss on disposal estimate for psg 

table of contents year ended december  and continuing operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain items in our consolidated statements of operations expressed as a percentage of revenue years ended december  revenue cost of services compensation data processing occupancy direct project costs other operating costs restructuring costs impairment of assets amortization of intangibles total cost of services operating loss gain on sale of assets net interest income loss from continuing operations before income taxes income taxes loss from continuing operations income loss from discontinued operations net income loss revenue for the fiscal year ended december  was million  an increase of million or compared to revenue of million in the year health management systems  which provides third party liability identification and recovery services to state medicaid agencies  generated revenue of million in  a million or increase over the prior year revenue of million 
this increase primarily reflected million of revenue during the current year from five new state clients  including a contract re award with an expanded scope of services 
in addition  revenue increased by million across the comparable client base reflecting specific non recurring revenue opportunities with certain clients based on their particular needs  differences in the timing of when client projects were completed in the current year compared with the prior year  and changes in the volume  yields and scope of client projects 
non recurring revenue opportunities are generally situations where we have an opportunity to earn additional revenue from a client which we do not expect will recur in the current year or which did not exist in the prior year 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in revenue resulting from the sale of the business of our former cdr associates subsidiary in july 
table of contents accordis  which provides outsourced business office services for hospitals  generated revenue of million in  a million or increase from the prior year revenue of million 
this increase primarily consisted of million of revenue from new customers since the prior year period  and a million increase with three customers resulting from an expansion in the scope of services provided

operating expenses in included a  restructuring charge and  as discussed in more detail below  operating expenses were adversely impacted by several non recurring charges  restructuring costs  asset impairments  write offs and higher costs of service development initiatives 
compensation expense as a percentage of revenue was in compared to in the prior year and for was million  an increase of million  or from the prior year period expense of million 
this increase resulted from an increase in staff  reflective of the growth in revenues and general increases in compensation rates  partially offset by a decrease of million from the sale of the business of our cdr associates subsidiary in july at december   we had employees  compared to employees at december  data processing expense as a percentage of revenue was in compared to in the prior fiscal year and for was million  a decrease of million or compared to the prior year expense of million 
the prior year costs included a a charge of million associated with the write off of internally developed software initiative based on our assessment of the project s future prospects  b a related charge of million for external software commitments which had been integral to the same project  but were no longer of value to us  and c a charge of  for two unrelated software assets that were no longer in use 
partially offsetting these decreases was a current year charge of  for the disposal and impairment of hardware and software items resulting from the termination of an unrelated service initiative 
occupancy expense as a percentage of revenue was in compared to in the prior fiscal year and for was million  a decrease of  or from the prior fiscal year expense of million 
this decrease was principally due to reductions in utilities  services and other expenses generally as a result of prior year reductions in space 
direct project expense as a percentage of revenue was in compared to in the prior fiscal year and for was million  a decrease of million or from the prior fiscal year expense of million 
during  accordis recognized bad debt expense of million related to a receivable due from the district of columbia 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
partially offsetting this reduction in bad debt expense was a million increase in expense related to accordis  and a  decrease in expense related to health management systems 
the accordis increase was principally due to the increase in revenue 
the decrease related to health management systems reflects a  reduction in marketing partner expenses reflecting a change in business strategy for engaging new clients partially offset by increased expenses associated with a increase in revenues 
other operating expenses as a percentage of revenue was in compared to in the prior year and for were million  a decrease of  or compared to the prior year expense of million 
consulting and professional fees including related travel costs decreased by  from million in to million in  principally due to two service development and system enhancement and reconfiguration activities that were terminated in the second quarter of 
table of contents restructuring costs as a percentage of revenue were in compared to in the prior year and in were  a decrease of million from the restructuring costs in reflect the net of a total charge of million in december  consisting of million for facility exit costs to vacate one floor at our new york city headquarters  and  for severance costs associated with reductions in the information technology and facilities maintenance departments  a net charge of  for facility exit costs and employee termination costs associated with the closure of our washington  dc office in march  and in october  a  reduction to the restructuring charge incurred in october associated with a facility consolidation initiative that was subsequently not undertaken 
restructuring costs in reflect an additional  restructuring charge associated with reducing the amount of office space we occupy at our headquarters in new york city based on an executed sublease and an additional  in facility exit costs associated with the closure of our washington dc office 
in december  we recognized an impairment of assets charge of million for the full impairment of goodwill which arose from our acquisition of the global computerized medical record based processing system business unit 
the impairment charge was measured based on the projected discounted future cash flows from the business unit over the remaining year amortization period of the goodwill using a discount rate reflective of our cost of funds 
operating loss for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  the accordis operating loss was million for the year ended december  compared to an operating loss of million in the prior year 
health management systems had an operating profit of million for the year ended december  compared to an operating loss of in the prior year 
the decrease in the accordis operating loss largely reflects several non recurring items in including million in data processing charges associated with a specific internal development initiative as discussed above  and the million bad debt charge related to a receivable from the district of columbia 
the return of health management systems to operating profitability largely reflects the increase in revenue discussed above  and the absence of the prior year non recurring charges including a million goodwill impairment charge for the global business unit and the  restructuring charge associated with closing the washington dc office 
in  we recognized a net gain on sale of assets of million from the sale of our edi business in january and our cdr business in july the sale of the edi business resulted in a loss of  on a sale price of million  the sale of the cdr business resulted in a gain of million on a sale price of million 
in and  we did not recognize any income tax benefit against our losses from continuing operations or the net losses from discontinued operations  but did recognize in a current income tax expense of  from the gain on sale of hcm 
this absence of an income tax benefit in reflects an increase in our valuation allowance for the recovery of our net deferred income tax assets 
we have incurred significant taxable losses the last several years 
most of our deferred income tax assets are in the form of net operating loss carryforwards 
the recoverability analysis was performed based on our recent taxable loss history and projections of future taxable operating results 
net interest income of  in fiscal year compared with  in the prior year reflected a shift to shorter term investments and a reduction in market interest rates 
loss from continuing operations was million in compared with a loss of million in the prior year 
the million reduction in loss largely reflects the reduction of non recurring charges  restructuring charges  asset impairments and asset write offs during the current year discussed above 
discontinued operations as more fully discussed in part item business  and note b of the notes to consolidated financial statements  we reported the results of psg and dsg as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
income 
table of contents from discontinued operations in of million was principally attributable to a million termination fee which was not included in the original loss on disposal estimate for psg  a reduction in the estimated loss on disposal of psg of  based on actual operating results  and  resulting from the favorable resolution of certain dsg operating liabilities 
loss from discontinued operations for was million 
the loss from discontinued operations reflects a restructuring charge of million and an asset impairment charge of million incurred in the psg business during april  upon the loss of its development partner 
the restructuring charge related to the write off of the subject development initiative and related employee terminations and facility exit costs 
the asset impairment charge related to the write off of goodwill and other intangibles associated with our prior acquisition of the psg business 
we determined to close psg in july  and the estimated loss on disposal of  represented the anticipated loss during the wind down period 
we sold our wholly owned subsidiary  hcm  which had operated as dsg  in december  recognizing a gain  after income tax expense  of million on a sale price of million 
thus  net loss on discontinued operations was million in net income was  in or 
per common share compared to a loss of million or per common share in the prior year 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
liquidity and capital resources historically  our principal sources of funds are operations and the remaining proceeds from our initial public offering in at december   our cash and short term investments and net working capital were million and million  respectively 
although we expect that operating cash flows will be a primary source of liquidity  the current significant cash and short term investment balances and working capital position are also fundamental sources of liquidity and capital resource 
the current cash and short term investment balances are more than sufficient to meet our short term funding needs that are not met by operating cash flows 
operating cash flows could be adversely affected by a decrease in demand for our services 
our typical customer relationship  however  usually has a duration of several years  such that we do not expect any current decrease in demand 
we estimate that we will purchase approximately million of property and equipment during  which is consistent with the amounts purchased on average during recent years 
the payments due by period for our contractual obligations  consisting principally of facility lease obligations and equipment rental and software license obligations  are as follows in thousands less than total one year years years after years operating leases we have entered into sublease arrangements for some of our facility obligations and expect to receive the following rental receipts in thousands less than total one year years years after years 
table of contents for the year ended december   cash provided by operations was million compared with  for the prior year 
the current year cash provided by operations of million primarily results from our million of net income plus depreciation and amortization charges of million  reduced by an increase in accounts receivable of million and a reduction in current liabilities of million 
during the current year  cash provided by investing activities was  reflecting the maturity of million of short term investments  which was substantially offset by  of property and equipment purchases 
cash provided by financing activities was  reflecting  from the exercise of stock options and the issuance of stock under our former employee stock purchase plan and  from the final repayment of a note receivable from an officer  which amounts were partially offset by  used to repurchase our common stock in the open market 
on may   the board of directors authorized us to repurchase such number of shares of our common stock that have an aggregate purchase price not in excess of  during  we purchased  shares on the open market at a total cost of  in  we purchased an additional  shares on the open market at a total cost of  cumulatively since the inception of the repurchase program  we have repurchased  shares having an aggregate purchase price of inflation historically  inflation has not been a material factor affecting our revenue  and general operating expenses have been subject to normal inflationary pressure 
however  our business is labor intensive 
wages and other employee related expenses increase during periods of inflation and when shortages in the skilled labor market occur 
we also have a performance based bonus plan to foster retention of and incent certain employees 
risk factors private securities litigation reform act of safe harbor compliance statement for forward looking statements in passing the private securities litigation reform act of the reform act  congress encouraged public companies to make forward looking statements by creating a safe harbor to protect companies from securities law liability in connection with forward looking statements 
we intend to qualify both our written and oral forward looking statements for protection under the reform act and any other similar safe harbor provisions 
forward looking statements are defined by the reform act 
generally  forward looking statements include expressed expectations of future events and the assumptions on which the expressed expectations are based 
all forward looking statements are inherently uncertain as they are based on various expectations and assumptions concerning future events and they are subject to numerous known and unknown risks and uncertainties which could cause actual events or results to differ materially from those projected 
due to those uncertainties and risks  prospective investors are urged not to place undue reliance on written or oral forward looking statements of the company 
we undertake no obligation to update or revise this safe harbor compliance statement for forward looking statements to reflect future developments 
in addition  we undertake no obligation to update or revise forward looking statements to reflect changed assumptions  the occurrence of unanticipated events or changes to future operating results over time 
we provide the following risk factor disclosure in connection with our continuing effort to qualify our written and oral forward looking statements for the safe harbor protection of the reform act and any other similar safe harbor provisions 
important factors currently known to management that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in forward looking statements include the following our operating results are subject to significant fluctuations due to variability in the timing of when we recognize contingency fee revenue and other factors 
as a result  you will not be able to rely on our operating results in any particular period as an indication of our future performance 
table of contents our revenue and consequently our operating results may vary significantly from period to period as a result of a number of factors  including the loss of customers due to consolidation in the healthcare industry  fluctuations in sales activity given our sales cycle of approximately three to eighteen months  and general economic conditions as they affect healthcare providers and payors 
further  we have experienced fluctuations in our revenue of up to between reporting periods due to the timing of periodic revenue recovery projects and the timing and delays in third party payors adjudication of claims and ultimate payment to our clients where our fees are contingent upon such collections 
the extent to which future revenue fluctuations could occur due to these factors is not known and cannot be predicted 
as a consequence  our results of operations are subject to significant fluctuations and our results of operations for any particular quarter or fiscal year may not be indicative of results of operations for future periods 
a significant portion of our operating expenses are fixed  and are based primarily on revenue and sales forecasts 
any inability on our part to reduce spending or to compensate for any failure to meet sales forecasts or receive anticipated revenues could magnify the adverse impact of such events on our operating results 
we are subject to claims if our service offerings contain errors or experience failures or do not meet customer expectations and could lose customers and revenue the healthcare claiming environment is complex 
on behalf of our clients  our accordis business processes a very high volume of transactions in this environment 
from time to time  we have been subject to claims by clients and could be subject to claims by clients in the future for errors in our service offerings  primarily for failures to secure reimbursement amounts otherwise payable to our clients 
we have often resolved such claims by providing additional services to the client or by reducing fees on additional projects 
there can be no assurance that contractual limitations of our responsibility for damages will be effective in these situations or that clients will not seek significant damages for errors in our services 
further  these performance failures could result in a loss of customers and resulting loss of revenue 
in addition  service performance failures could result in a delay in market acceptance for our services  diversion of development resources  damage to our reputation or increased service costs 
the majority of our contracts with customers may be terminated for convenience the majority of our contracts with customers are terminable upon short notice for the convenience of either party 
although to date none of our material contracts have ever been terminated under these provisions  we cannot assure you that a material contract will not be terminated for convenience in the future 
any termination of a material contract  if not replaced  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we face significant competition for our services competition for our services is intense and is expected to increase 
increased competition could result in reductions in our prices  gross margins and market share 
we compete with other providers of healthcare information management and data processing services  as well as healthcare consulting firms 
some competitors have formed business alliances with other competitors that may affect our ability to work with some potential customers 
in addition  if some of our competitors merge  a stronger competitor may emerge 
current and prospective customers also evaluate our capabilities against the merits of their existing information management and data processing systems and expertise 
major information management systems companies  including those specializing in the healthcare industry  that do not presently offer competing services may enter our markets 
many of our competitors and potential competitors have significantly greater financial  technical  product development  marketing and other resources  and market recognition than we have 
as a result  our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies  changes in customer requirements and changes in the political  economic or regulatory environment in the healthcare industry 
in addition  several of our competitors may be in a position to devote greater resources to the development  promotion  and sale of their services than us 

table of contents simplification of the healthcare transfer payment process could reduce the need for our services the complexity of the healthcare transfer payment process  and our experience in offering services that improve the ability of our customers to recover incremental revenue through that process  have been contributing factors to the success our service offerings 
complexities of the healthcare transfer payment process include multiple payors  the coordination and utilization of clinical  operational  financial and or administrative review instituted by third party payors in an effort to control costs and manage care 
if the payment processes associated with the healthcare industry are simplified  the need for our services  or the price customers are willing to pay for our services  could be reduced 
we are subject to government regulation in our collections services the collection industry in the united states is regulated both at the federal and state level 
in addition to specific regulation regarding debts for healthcare services and among other collection regulations the federal fair debt collection practices act ffdcpa regulates any person who regularly collects or attempts to collect  directly or indirectly  consumer debts owed or asserted to be owed to another person 
the ffdcpa establishes specific guidelines and procedures that debt collectors must follow in communicating with consumer debtors  including the time  place and manner of such communications and places restrictions on communications with individuals other than consumer debtors in connection with the collection of any consumer debt 
additionally  the ffdcpa contains various notice and disclosure requirements and prohibits unfair or misleading representations by debt collectors 
many states require that we be licensed as a debt collection company and we believe that we are currently hold applicable licenses from all states where required 
if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations  it could result in the suspension or termination of our ability to conduct collections  which would have a material adverse effect on us 
changes in the united states healthcare environment could have a material negative impact on our revenue and net income the healthcare industry in the united states is subject to changing political  economic and regulatory influences that may affect the procurement practices and operations of healthcare organizations 
our services are designed to function within the structure of the healthcare financing and reimbursement system currently being used in the united states 
during the past several years  the healthcare industry has been subject to increasing levels of governmental regulation of  among other things  reimbursement rates  certain capital expenditures  and data confidentiality and privacy 
from time to time  certain proposals to reform the healthcare system have been considered by congress 
these proposals  if enacted  may increase government involvement in healthcare  lower reimbursement rates and otherwise change the operating environment for our clients 
healthcare organizations may react to these proposals and the uncertainty surrounding such proposals by curtailing or deferring their retention of service providers such as us 
see also part item business healthcare reform and regulatory matters for additional discussion on this topic 
we cannot predict what impact  if any  such proposals or healthcare reforms might have on our results of operations  financial condition or business 
recently  the general accounting office  an investigative arm of congress  added medicaid to its list of high risk programs 
according to the gao  states have used various financing schemes to generate excessive federal medicaid matching funds while their own share of expenditures has remained unchanged or decreased 
also on january   the united states senate finance committee chairman requested that the hhs  cms  and oig respond to a lengthy request for information about vendors that provide contingency fee based revenue maximizing or revenue enhancement services to state medicaid agencies specifically with the intent to increase federal medicaid reimbursement 
this type of service represents a very small portion of our health management systems  inc suite of offerings and corresponding revenue streams 
we cannot predict what impact  if any  this inquiry might have on our future results of operations  financial condition or business 

table of contents our business is subject to extensive and complex governmental regulations and violations of any of those regulations could result in significant penalties most of the services offered by our accordis business involve the billing and collection of healthcare claims 
these services require the interpretation and application of sometimes ambiguous reimbursement regulations under various government entitlement programs such as medicaid and medicare 
in addition  during the past several years  federal and state governments have placed an increased emphasis on detecting and eliminating fraud and abuse in medicare  medicaid  and other health care programs 
violation of health care billing laws or regulations governing our services could result in the imposition of substantial civil or criminal penalties  including temporary or permanent exclusion from participation in government health care programs such as medicare and medicaid  and loss of customers 
the interpretation and application of the healthcare reimbursement rules to particular customer patient accounting environments involves judgment 
if a regulatory agency were to disagree with certain judgments we have made or will make in providing healthcare billing services to a customer we could be subject to penalties  or fines or other sanctions by regulators 
in addition  we could find it necessary to alter or eliminate some of our services 
certain provisions in our certificate of incorporation could discourage unsolicited takeover attempts  which could depress the market price of our common stock our certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to  shares of blank check preferred stock with such designations  rights and preferences as may be determined by our board of directors 
accordingly  our board of directors is empowered  without shareholder approval  to issue preferred stock with dividend  liquidation  conversion  voting or other rights  which could adversely affect the voting power or  other rights of holders of our common stock 
in the event of issuance  preferred stock could be utilized  under certain circumstances  as a method of discouraging  delaying or preventing a change in control 
although we have no present intention to issue any shares of preferred stock  we cannot assure you that we will not do so in the future 
in addition  our by laws provide for a classified board of directors  which could also have the effect of discouraging a change of control 
adverse resolution of ongoing investigation by the united states attorney s office could cause a material adverse effect on our business on january   we announced that we had received a subpoena issued under the health insurance portability and accountability act of from the united states attorney s office for the southern district of new york in connection with an investigation relating to possible federal healthcare offenses 
the subpoena sought the production of certain documents from january to present relating to medical reimbursement claims submitted by us to medicare  medicaid  and other federal healthcare programs  particularly on behalf of a significant client of accordis 
our board of directors appointed a special committee to oversee our response to the investigation 
we continue to cooperate fully with the investigation 
private parties may assert claims against healthcare providers for violations of healthcare laws in actions known as qui tam suits 
in these cases  the complaints filed by private litigants are sealed with the court  pending a decision by the government as to whether it will intervene in  and take control of  the litigation 
if the government declines to intervene  the private litigant may independently pursue the case against the healthcare provider 
in the course of discussions with the united states attorney s office  we learned that a qui tam lawsuit has been filed against us in the us district court for the southern district of new york 
because the qui tam complaint remains sealed  we have not had any opportunity to review its allegations 
we believe  however  that it is likely that the complaint primarily relates to the matters covered by the government s subpoena 
we intend to vigorously defend any qui tam proceeding that is asserted against us 

table of contents we are not able to give any assurances as to the duration or outcome of the investigation or as to the effect that any proceedings that may be brought by the government may have on our financial condition or results of operations 
the initiation of proceedings against us  even if we are ultimately successful in defending them  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations or liquidity
