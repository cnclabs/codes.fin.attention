item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview universal corporation  through its subsidiaries  is the world s largest independent leaf tobacco merchant and has operations in agri products and the distribution of lumber and building products 
the company derives most of its tobacco revenues from sales of processed tobacco to manufacturers of tobacco products throughout the world and from fees and commissions for specific services 
during the three fiscal years ended march   universal has operated in tobacco markets that were in balance or in a slightly short supply situation with little excess inventory available to supply customers 
the company has been diversifying its sources of supply in the wake of the four year decline in supply from zimbabwe  previously one of the world s largest exporters of tobacco  and the consequent increases in volume from south america to fill requirements 
in addition  universal has been rationalizing its operations and improving its processing capabilities in the united states amid continued declining demand for  and production of  us flue cured and burley tobacco due to uncompetitive pricing 
the lumber and building products segment has been weathering a recalcitrant recession in europe while expanding its operations through small acquisitions  culminating in the purchase of j w  a large molding manufacturer and distributor of diy supplies in january during the recession  the strength of the euro helped buoy us dollar translated income 
during the period  the agri products segment has found difficult markets for many of its products  especially sunflower seeds and tea 
although income has been consistent during these three fiscal years  heavy demands for capital to diversify tobacco sources  improve us processing capabilities  and expand the lumber and building products business have required the company to increase debt 
in the three fiscal years ended march   the company has increased inventories  advances to suppliers  and receivables by million and spent million on capital projects and acquisitions 
in addition  the company has returned funds to its shareholders in the form of million in dividends and million in share repurchases 
total debt increased by million during that time  and the company has used funds from operations  bank debt  public debt  and secured financing to fund its needs over the period 
management expects to see much larger flue cured and burley crops for fiscal year  although in the near term  adverse weather conditions in brazil have reduced the amount and style of ripe leaf required by some customers 
production in brazil has expanded rapidly to replace lost volume from zimbabwe  but the company continues to make significant investments in african countries to provide a more diverse supply base 
universal expects to see larger volumes of african leaf beginning in fiscal year us volumes continue to decline due to non competitive leaf prices and the absence of any meaningful change in the federal tobacco program 
there are some early indications that economic conditions in europe that ultimately will affect the company s lumber operations are improving 

table of contents change in fiscal year end in august  universal s board of directors approved a change in universal s fiscal year end from june to march this change better matches the fiscal reporting period with the crop and operating cycles of the company s largest operations and allowed the company to eliminate a three month reporting lag previously used for most of its foreign subsidiaries 
in view of this change  the forthcoming discussion compares the consolidated financial statements as of and for the nine months ended march  the transition period with the consolidated financial statements as of and for the nine months ended march  in the consolidated financial statements for the nine months ended march   net income for the foreign subsidiaries for the three month period ended march   representing the elimination of the reporting lag  is reflected as an addition to retained earnings in the consolidated statement of shareholders equity 
in addition  the net change in cash and cash equivalents for foreign subsidiaries for this three month period is reported on a separate line item in the consolidated statement of cash flows 
throughout this discussion  data for all periods except as of and for the nine months ended march   are derived from the company s consolidated financial statements  which appear in this report 
all data as of and for the nine months ended march   are derived from our unaudited consolidated financial statements  which are presented in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
summary financial information for the twelve months ended march   recast to show historical results without the reporting lag for foreign subsidiaries can also be found in note of notes to consolidated financial statements

last year s results included million of restructuring charges before taxes  or million after taxes 
per diluted share 
the charges related to rationalizing us operations 
gross revenues were approximately billion for the nine months compared to about billion in the same period last year 
revenues were higher in all business segments 
most of the increase in tobacco segment revenue for the nine months came from larger volumes shipped from south 
table of contents america 
the nine months benefited from the impact of a stronger euro on translation of revenues from european operations in both tobacco and lumber 
in addition  revenues increased due to the addition of j w  acquired in january agri products revenues were up due to increased volume and prices in tea and rubber and the acquisition of a small nut processor 
tobacco segment earnings increased by about to about million for the nine months compared to the same period last year 
tobacco operations benefited from larger shipments from south america and processing improvements in the united states despite smaller crops in both areas 
the us improvements were due to efficiencies and yield enhancements from a new north carolina plant and a refurbished virginia plant 
the impact of lower shipments from africa in the nine months was partially offset by interest income in zimbabwe  which increased by million due to higher interest rates on larger local currency cash balances accumulated because of limitations on uses of those funds 
near the end of the nine month transition year  a customer of a foreign subsidiary rejected certain shipments of tobacco because they did not meet that customer s requirements 
no sales revenue or profit has been reported on these shipments  which were made during the four months after the subsidiary s second fiscal quarter 
management has estimated the cost associated with this tobacco  primarily shipping costs 
the company has also written down the inventory to its estimated net realizable value 
the company recorded a charge related to this matter of million  before taxes  during the period ended march  of the charge  million is related to shipments delivered in the three months ended december   and is reflected in the consolidated statements of income for the nine months ended march  the balance of the million related to shipments delivered in january and reduced the income of foreign subsidiaries recorded as a direct addition to retained earnings on the consolidated balance sheets 
management is working with the customer to mitigate the effects of its claim and develop a strategy to meet customer requirements for future crops 
us tobacco operations reflected the benefit of a one time shift in the allocation of fixed factory overhead associated with the change in the company s fiscal year end 
universal recognizes its fixed factory overhead expense in the united states in the quarters in which the tobacco is processed 
since processing does not normally occur during the period between april and june  the projected overhead expense for that period has historically been allocated to the preceding three quarters of each fiscal year  based on volumes processed 
because of the change in fiscal year end to march  the factory overhead expense for the period from april through june   will be reported in fiscal year results  and will be allocated to the subsequent quarters of that fiscal year 
operating income for each quarter of the nine month transitional year ending march   reflects this benefit 
had fiscal year included the estimated fixed factory overhead expense for april through june   tobacco segment operating income would have been million lower for the nine months 
including the estimated effect of the us fixed factory overhead allocation  pro forma tobacco segment operating earnings were up by million  or  for the nine months 
the following table provides data that is comparable to the prior year s results 
in thousands of dollars nine months ended march  nine months ended march  tobacco segment operating income  as reported estimated us overhead allocation pro forma tobacco segment operating income 
table of contents segment operating income from lumber and building products improved by about for the nine months to million 
the increase is due to the strength of the euro  which gained more than on average compared to the same period last year  and the acquisition of j w 
throughout the nine month period  volume  especially in the construction supplies markets  suffered from the effects of an economic recession in the netherlands and other european countries 
with improvements in sunflower seeds and rubber businesses  results from the agri products segment were down  due to disappointing performance of a small nut processor acquired last year 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the nine months increased by million primarily due to the strength of the euro and the acquisition of j w 
interest expense increased by million due to higher average debt balances during the nine months 
the company s effective tax rate was compared to last year 
the increase was primarily caused by changes in the mix of foreign earnings 
results of foreign subsidiaries for the three months ended march  along with its change in fiscal year end  the company has also eliminated a three month reporting lag previously used by most of its foreign subsidiaries 
reported income for the nine month transition year includes the results of the company s foreign subsidiaries for the nine months ended december  results of foreign subsidiaries for the three months ended march   which represents the reporting lag the lag quarter  were not reflected in the reported income  but were recorded as an addition to retained earnings 
operating income for the lag quarter was million  the major components of which arose from shipments of african  european  and oriental tobaccos and from lumber and building products operations 
a new currency auction system  sanctioned in zimbabwe in january  effectively reduced currency rates and caused remeasurement losses on local currency cash balances held there 
those remeasurement losses were million  and were partially offset by interest income of million on local currency balances 
lag quarter results were also reduced by a million charge  discussed above  which was part of the total million recorded to recognize the estimated cost of a claim against tobacco that did not meet customer requirements 
net income for the lag quarter was million 
fiscal year ended june   compared to fiscal year ended june  sales and other operating revenues were approximately billion for fiscal year compared to about billion for fiscal year fiscal year benefited from the impact of the stronger euro on translation of revenues from the company s dutch lumber and building products operations into us dollars and the fourth quarter addition of the revenues of j w 
most of the tobacco segment revenue increase for the fiscal year came from the larger volumes shipped from south america 
agri products segment revenue was up modestly due to good results in the company s dried fruit and nuts business 
during fiscal year  universal recognized approximately million in restructuring charges  of which million resulted from the reduction of operations in zimbabwe due to the decline in 
table of contents crops there 
the remaining million represented costs of rationalizing us operations 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in may  the company entered an agreement to settle the deloach lawsuit  which involved alleged industry violation of antitrust laws  and accordingly recorded a charge of million in fiscal year in addition  during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company recognized a million gain on the sale of assets in africa and the netherlands as well as a million gain on remeasurement of local currency liabilities after export rates were adjusted in africa 
the remeasurement gain was not taxable in the country of origin  and consistent with universal s policy regarding permanently reinvested earnings  no provision for us income taxes was made on the gain 
the aggregate of the charges and gains for fiscal year was a charge of million 
in fiscal year  the company recorded charges of million related to the consolidation of us operations and million related to argentine currency devaluation 
summary of charges and gains in millions  except per share amounts fiscal year fiscal year change restructuring charges tobacco segment settlement of lawsuit african currency remeasurement gain fiscal year gain on asset sales argentine currency devaluation consolidation costs net gain charge lumber building products segment fiscal year gain on asset sales increase decrease in operating income increase decrease in net income increase decrease in earnings per share fiscal year segment operating income as described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements was million  up million from that of fiscal year as listed above  that increase included a million net gain in the tobacco segment and a million gain in the lumber and building products segment 
tobacco segment earnings benefited from larger crops in brazil  argentina  and several african countries  and those increases more than offset the decline in zimbabwe crops 
shipments of brazilian and argentine tobaccos increased substantially  as customers shifted purchase requirements from zimbabwe to brazil and purchased more argentine tobacco following the currency devaluation there in dark tobacco volumes were down for fiscal year due to lower sales of old crop tobacco and smaller crops in several origins 
the oriental tobacco joint venture s results for fiscal year also declined primarily due to customers delay of shipments until fiscal year  expenses related to the new plants in greece and bulgaria  and smaller shipments of old crop tobacco 
excluding the million net effect of the charges and gains listed in the table above  tobacco segment earnings decreased by million for fiscal year buoyed by the strong euro  which gained more than on average during fiscal year against the us dollar  results from the lumber and building products segment improved by million  or for the year  excluding the million gain on sale of assets 
throughout the fiscal year  volume suffered from the effects of an economic slowdown in the netherlands and other 
table of contents european countries 
however  the results benefited from the company s acquisition of j w 
earnings from the agri products segment were flat for fiscal year as stronger results in the company s dried fruit and nut business offset the impact of difficult market conditions in the remainder of the segment 
selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal year increased by million or due to the million charge for the settlement of the deloach lawsuit  the impact of the strong euro on euro based expenses  the addition of j w  and higher legal expenses as well as insurance costs 
these amounts were partially offset by a net remeasurement gain of million 
interest expense decreased by million to million due to lower interest rates in fiscal year compared to the company capitalized approximately million in interest related to the construction of the nash facility in fiscal year and approximately thousand in fiscal year universal s consolidated income tax rate for fiscal year was compared to in fiscal year the major factor that generated the decrease in the tax rate for the company was the impact of lower taxes in subsidiaries in which it is the company s policy to permanently reinvest earnings 
the company did not record us tax expense on earnings not distributed from most countries in africa 
the company generated over million in remeasurement gains that were not subject to local tax expense in these countries 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued a revision of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits statement no 

the revised statement expands the disclosure requirements of the original statement no 
and incorporates pension and postretirement benefits disclosures for interim financial periods 
the company adopted the provisions of the revised statement no 
during the quarter ended march  the expanded disclosures are presented in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued staff position no 
fsp no 
 accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of fsp no 
provided accounting and disclosure guidance related to the effects on a company s postretirement benefit costs and obligations of recent legislation that added a prescription drug benefit to the federal medicare program 
that legislation also provides a federal subsidy to companies that sponsor retiree medical programs with drug benefits that are actuarially equivalent to those now available under medicare 
as allowed under fsp no 
 the company elected to defer accounting recognition for the subsidy until detailed implementation guidance was made available 
the fasb issued that guidance in may with the release of fsp no 
 which replaces fsp no 
the company believes that its postretirement benefit plan currently provides prescription drug coverage that is at least actuarially equivalent to the new benefit available under medicare  and it will therefore qualify for the subsidy 
as required under fsp no 
 the company will adopt accounting recognition for the subsidy as of july  the financial statements for the interim period ending september   the second quarter of fiscal year  will reflect the effect of the subsidy on the company s benefit obligation and related cost 
the adoption of fsp no 
is not expected to have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources overview universal s liquidity and capital resource requirements are predominantly short term in nature and primarily relate to working capital required for tobacco crop purchases 
working capital needs are seasonal within each geographic region 
the geographic dispersion and the timing of working capital needs permit universal to predict its general level of cash requirements 
the marketing of the crop in each geographic area is heavily influenced by weather conditions and follows the cycle of buying  processing  and shipping of the tobacco crop 
the timing of individual customer shipping requirements may change the level or the duration of crop financing 
despite a predominance of short term needs  the company maintains a relatively large portion of its total debt as long term to reduce liquidity risk 
as a result of the company s change in year end and elimination of its reporting lag  the change in the company s asset and liability balances from june  to march   reflect nine months of cash flows for its domestic subsidiaries and twelve months of cash flows for its foreign subsidiaries 
the net change in cash and cash equivalents for foreign subsidiaries for the additional three month period caused by the elimination of the reporting lag is reported as a single line item in the company s consolidated statement of cash flows 
to more fully explain the company s financial position at march   the following table presents the components of the net change in cash and cash equivalents for foreign subsidiaries for the additional three month period caused by the elimination of the reporting lag as well as the summarized components for the nine months ended march  it also combines them to show the net cash flow that affected the company s consolidated balance sheets as of march  cash flow as reported nine months foreign subsidiaries three months cash flow since june  net cash provided used by operating activities net cash provided used by investing activities net cash provided used by financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents as reported in the consolidated statement of cash flows 
the net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents of foreign subsidiaries for the three months ended march  is reported on a single line in the consolidated statement of cash flows 
the sum of the reported cash flow for the nine months ended march   and the cash flow of foreign subsidiaries for the three months ended march  working capital working capital at march   which includes the cash flows of the company s foreign subsidiaries for the three month period ended march   was million  up million from the level at june  most of the increase was driven by increases in accounts receivable  advances to suppliers  tobacco and agri product inventory levels  and decreases in notes payable and the current portion of long term obligations 
the weakness of the us dollar in relation to the strength of the euro  which gained more than on average compared to the same period last year  caused a million increase in receivables and a million increase in inventory  each as translated into us dollars 
seasonal changes in working capital components are normal as tobacco inventories usually 
table of contents fluctuate during the year based on when tobacco is received  processed  and shipped to customers 
due to the elimination of the reporting lag for the company s foreign subsidiaries  tobacco inventory levels for the periods ended march   and june   are seasonally comparable because both reflect large seasonal expansions in south and central america 
at june   tobacco inventories were unusually high due to early purchases in brazil and delayed shipments from africa  and they had increased again by march  tobacco inventories during the nine months and the lag quarter increased about million to million as of march   and the company s uncommitted inventories increased to approximately million compared to million at june  a primary factor in the increases in both total and uncommitted inventories was a customer s rejection of certain shipments of tobacco because they did not meet that customer s requirements 
uncommitted tobacco stocks increased from of total tobacco inventory at june   to of total tobacco inventory at march  management does not consider these levels excessive 
over the same period  agri products inventories and accounts receivable increased by million and million  respectively  due to the higher prices for tea and rubber and an extension of the nut business 
advances to suppliers increased by million primarily due to the expansion of tobacco sources in africa 
customer advances and deposits increased by million to million as of march   in part because of the larger brazilian crop 
the level of customer advances can vary from year to year as customers review their circumstances 
accordingly  the company treats such advances as borrowing when it reviews its balance street structure 
accounts receivable increased by million  primarily due to the strength of the euro as well as the change in fiscal year end  which caused a change in the timing of the elimination of intercompany accounts 
the decline in the current portion of long term debt was a key factor in the working capital increase as the company repaid maturing debt with a long term debt issue 
capital spending at march   the company s balance of property  plant  and equipment  before depreciation  increased by million from the balance at june  the company s capital expenditures are generally limited to those that add value to the customer  replace equipment  increase efficiency  or position the company for future growth 
universal s capital expenditures were approximately million in nine months ended march   before considering the lag quarter  and million in the nine months ended march  during the lag quarter  the company s capital expenditures were approximately million 
approximately million of the capital expenditures in the nine months ended march   related to the completion of a major investment in leaf processing in the united states 
outstanding debt and other financing arrangements universal s total debt increased by about million during the nine months ended march   and lag quarter  and its total debt as a percentage of total capitalization including total debt  deferred taxes  minority interests  and shareholders equity decreased to about from approximately at june  the increase in debt reflected the effect of the stronger euro and the company s working capital investments and capital expenditures in africa and brazil 
the company has invested in these regions to expand tobacco sources for its customers 
the decrease in total debt to total capitalization was caused by a million increase in shareholders equity  which was primarily attributable to million excess of income over dividends as well as a million increase in accumulated other comprehensive income due to the weakness of the us dollar and the reduction in the minimum pension liability 
total long term obligations  including current maturities  increased by million to million while notes payable decreased by million to million 
the increase in long term obligations was primarily due to the company s issuance of million of medium term 
table of contents notes due october  the proceeds were used to repay maturing long term debt of million in medium term notes  million in medium term notes  and for other general corporate purposes 
the company has million remaining under a million shelf registration that became effective in august  and expects to use the proceeds of any sales of these securities for general corporate purposes  which may include the repayment of indebtedness  capital expenditures  acquisitions  and funding of working capital needs 
in february  moody s investors service affirmed the company s credit ratings  but changed its outlook for the ratings from stable to negative 
if the company s credit ratings are lowered in the future  then the interest rates on any new debt issued by the company and some of the company s existing debt could increase  and the company s access to debt markets could be reduced 
during the nine months ended march   the company terminated interest rate swaps on million notional amount of long term debt for a gain of approximately million  which will be amortized over the remaining life of the underlying debt 
from time to time  the company uses interest rate swap agreements to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates 
these agreements typically adjust interest rates on designated long term obligations from fixed to variable 
the swaps are accounted for as fair value hedges 
there were no interest rate swap agreements in place at march near the end of fiscal year  universal entered a foreign currency swap with a third party to mitigate its exposure to changes in exchange rates related to a foreign currency denominated receivable from a subsidiary 
the swap converts a fixed rate  foreign currency denominated receivable to a fixed rate receivable denominated in us dollars 
it is accounted for as a cash flow hedge  and its notional amount was approximately million 
as of march   universal had approximately million in uncommitted lines of credit  of which approximately million was unused and available to support seasonal working capital needs 
the company s committed bank facilities total million 
the facilities include a million revolving credit facility and a million term loan  each of which will mature on april  as of march   the company had no amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
universal s commercial paper program  which provides flexibility in the company s short term borrowings  is supported by the revolving credit facility 
under the terms of its bank agreements  the company must maintain certain levels of tangible net worth and working capital and observe restrictions on debt levels 
the company was in compliance with all such covenants at march  in may  universal s board of directors approved a share purchase program that has since been expanded to permit the purchase of up to million of the common stock of the company 
the purchases are carried out from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at prices not exceeding prevailing market prices 
over time  the purchases have been  and are expected to be  funded primarily from operating cash flow of the company 
on may   the board of directors of the company extended the expiration of the share repurchase program to june  at march   universal had approximately million common shares outstanding and has purchased approximately million common shares for about million pursuant to the program 
funds supporting the company s erisa regulated domestic defined benefit pension plans increased to million because of positive market activity during the nine months ended december   the measurement date for the plan 
as of april   the market value of the fund was about million  compared to the accumulated benefit obligation abo of million and the projected benefit obligation pbo of million 
the abo and pbo are calculated on the basis of certain assumptions that are outlined in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the 
table of contents company plans to contribute approximately million to the domestic pension fund during the next year  which is more than the contribution required by erisa 
it is the company s policy to monitor the market performance of the funds and to review the adequacy of its funding and its contributions to those funds 
the fund is managed for long term returns  and the company has not changed its investment allocation in response to recent market returns 
contractual obligations the company s contractual obligations as of march   were as follows total thereafter notes payable and long term debt operating lease obligations inventory purchase obligations tobacco lumber agri products agricultural materials capital expenditure obligations total includes interest payments 
interest payments on million of variable rate debt are estimated on the basis of march  rates 
in addition to principal and interest payments on notes payable and long term debt  the company s contractual obligations include operating lease payments  inventory purchase commitments  and capital expenditure commitments 
operating lease obligations represent minimum payments due under leases for various production  storage  distribution  and other facilities  as well as vehicles and equipment 
tobacco inventory purchase obligations primarily represent contracts to purchase tobacco from farmers 
the amounts shown above are estimates since actual quantities purchased will depend on crop yield and prices will depend on the quality of the tobacco delivered 
more than half of the company s contracts to purchase tobacco are with farmers in brazil 
tobacco purchase obligations have been partially funded by advances to farmers  which totaled approximately million as of march  commitments to purchase agri products inventories are frequently matched to forward sales contracts with customers 
capital expenditure obligations represent the company s outstanding contractual commitments to complete and equip a new tobacco processing factory and related facilities in mozambique 
management believes that its financial resources are adequate to support its capital needs 
those resources include cash from operations  cash balances  the potential to issue debt to the public under its shelf registration statement and the commercial paper market and committed and uncommitted bank lines 
any excess cash flow from operations after dividends and capital expenditures will be available to fund expansion  purchase the company s stock  or otherwise enhance shareholder value 

table of contents critical accounting estimates and assumptions in preparing the financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap  management is required to make estimates and assumptions that have an impact on the assets  liabilities  revenue  and expense amounts reported 
these estimates can also affect supplemental information disclosures of the company  including information about contingencies  risk  and financial condition 
the company believes  given current facts and circumstances  its estimates and assumptions are reasonable  adhere to gaap  and are consistently applied 
however  changes in the assumptions used could result in a material adjustment to the financial statements 
the company s most critical accounting estimates and assumptions are in the following areas inventories inventories of tobacco and agri products are valued at the lower of cost or market with cost determined under the specific cost method 
in the tobacco and agri product businesses  raw materials are clearly identified at the time of purchase 
the company tracks the costs associated with raw materials in the final product lots  and maintains this identification through the time of sale 
the company also capitalizes direct and indirect costs related to processing raw materials 
this method of cost accounting is referred to as the specific cost or specific identification method 
lumber and building products inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined under the first in  first out method 
the company writes down inventory for changes in market value based upon assumptions related to future demand and market conditions 
future demand assumptions can be impacted by changes in customer sales  changes in customers inventory positions and policies  competitors pricing policies and inventory positions  changing customer needs  and varying crop sizes and qualities 
market conditions that differ significantly from those assumed by management could result in additional write downs 
the company experiences inventory write downs routinely 
inventory write downs in the nine months ended march   and fiscal years and were million  million  and million  respectively 
intangible assets the company reviews the carrying value of goodwill as necessary  and at least annually  utilizing a discounted cash flow model 
the preparation of discounted future operating cash flow analyses requires significant management judgment with respect to operating earnings growth rates and the selection of an appropriate discount rate 
the majority of the company s goodwill is from acquisitions in the tobacco segment 
neither a one percentage point increase in the discount rate assumption nor a one percentage point decline in the cash flow growth rate assumption would result in an impairment charge 
however  significant changes in estimates of future cash flows  such as those caused by unforeseen events or changes in market conditions  could result in an impairment charge 
income taxes the company s effective tax rate is based on its expected income  statutory tax rates  and tax planning opportunities in the various jurisdictions in which the company operates 
significant judgment is required in determining the effective tax rate and evaluating the tax position of the company 
the effective tax rate is applied to quarterly operating results 
the company  through its subsidiaries  is subject to the tax laws of many jurisdictions  and could be subject to a tax audit in each of these jurisdictions  which could result in changes to estimated taxes 
in the event that there is a significant  unusual  or one time item recognized in the company s results  the tax attributed to that item would be recorded at the same time as the item 
for example  in fiscal year  a significant adjustment in a 
table of contents currency export rate generated a remeasurement gain in africa that did not result in local taxation 
consistent with company policy regarding permanently reinvested earnings  no provision for us income taxes was recorded on the gain  which reduced the consolidated tax rate 
tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements 
as a result  the company s effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in its tax returns 
some of these differences are permanent  such as expenses that are not tax deductible  while others are related to timing issues  such as differences in depreciation methods 
timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in future tax returns for which the company has already recorded the tax benefit in its financial statements 
the company has recorded valuation allowances for deferred tax assets when the amount of estimated future taxable income was not likely to support the use of the deduction or credit 
during the nine months ended march   the company received a significant dividend from a foreign subsidiary that enabled the company to fully utilize its foreign tax credit carryforwards of approximately million 
however  the company expects foreign tax carryforwards to be generated in future periods 
any significant reduction in future taxable income and changes in its sources or changes in us or foreign tax laws could result in the expiration of foreign tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in the company s financial statements for which payment has been deferred or an expense that has not yet been recognized in the financial statements and has been deducted in the company s tax return 
for additional disclosures on income taxes  see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
pension plans and postretirement benefits the measurement of the company s pension and postretirement obligations and costs are dependent on a variety of assumptions used by the company s actuaries 
these assumptions include estimating the present value of projected future pension payments to all plan participants  taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future events such as salary increases and demographic experience 
the assumptions made by the company may have an effect on the amount and timing of future contributions 
the plan trustee conducts an independent valuation of the fair value of pension plan assets 
the significant assumptions used in the calculation of pension and postretirement obligations are discount rate the discount rate is based on investment yields available at the measurement date on corporate long term bonds rated aa 
salary growth the salary growth assumption is a factor of the company s long term actual experience  the near term outlook  and assumed inflation 
expected return on plan assets the expected return reflects asset allocations and investment strategy 
retirement and mortality rates retirement rates are based on actual plan experience along with the company s near term outlook 
early retirement assumptions are based on actual company experience 
mortality rates are based on standard group annuity ga mortality tables 

table of contents health care cost trends for postretirement medical plan obligations and costs  the company makes assumptions on future increases in medical costs 
these assumptions are based on the actual experience of the company along with third party forecasts of long term medical cost trends 
the effect of actual results differing from the company s assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  generally affect its recognized expense in such future periods 
sensitivity analysis 
the effect of the indicated decrease or increase in the selected assumptions is shown below  assuming no change in benefit levels in thousands effect on projected benefit obligation increase decrease effect on annual expense increase decrease change in assumption pension plans increase in discount rate decrease in discount rate increase in salary scale decrease in salary scale increase in rate of return on assets n a  decrease in rate of return on assets n a  change in assumption other postretirement benefits increase in discount rate decrease in discount rate increase in medical inflation decrease in medical inflation see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on pension and postretirement benefit plans 
other information regarding trends and management s actions the company s financial performance depends on its ability to maintain efficient operations and to secure the tobacco volumes desired by its customers 
in fiscal year  worldwide flue cured production by exporting countries excluding china is forecast to increase by  on the strength of a very large brazilian crop  and burley crops are expected to be up by more than 
due to adverse weather  however  the brazilian crop has not produced as much ripe leaf as normal  which will make it difficult to provide all of the leaf qualities and styles needed to meet some customers requirements 
african flue cured leaf volumes will continue to be depressed following the four year decline in zimbabwean crops as a result of instability in that country 
production in brazil has expanded rapidly to replace that volume  but the company continues to make significant investments in african countries to provide a more diverse supply base 
universal expects to see the benefits from these investments in the 
table of contents form of larger volumes of african leaf beginning in fiscal year us volumes continue to slide  reflecting non competitive leaf prices and the absence of any meaningful change in the federal tobacco program 
although the company s recent investments in state of the art us processing facilities are enabling it to operate efficiently in this environment  comparisons in fiscal will be unfavorably affected due to the overhead cost allocation in fiscal year because of the change in fiscal year end  results for fiscal year excluded approximately million in overhead costs 
fiscal year will treat overhead normally 
there are some early indications that economic conditions in europe that ultimately will affect the company s lumber operations are improving 
management remains confident that the company is well structured to deal with the challenges of its markets and well positioned to capitalize on opportunities in the year ahead 
the company expects that demand for leaf tobacco will be flat or declining slightly for the near term primarily due to the flattening trend in world cigarette consumption and to improved leaf utilization by cigarette manufacturers 
on a year to year basis  the company is susceptible to fluctuations in leaf supply due to crop size and leaf demand as manufacturers adjust inventories or respond to changes in the cigarette market 
the company estimates that industry worldwide uncommitted flue cured and burley inventories totaled about million kilos  excluding inventories of asian government owned monopolies  at march  uncommitted inventories have declined in each of the last four years 
at march   the us stabilization cooperatives held about million kilos 
with large crops in south america  this trend may reverse in fiscal year although cigar consumption continues to grow at a modest pace in the united states  consumption within the main european union markets has declined slightly 
supplies of filler and binder tobaccos  which over the last several years have been in surplus due to overproduction in certain countries  have generally returned to a balance between supply and demand 
supply and demand of cigar wrapper continues to be firm 
within the smokeless segment of the dark tobacco business  consumption of loose leaf chewing tobacco continues to decline by about four percent annually  while the consumption of snuff products has been growing between three and four percent per year 
management believes that there is an adequate supply of suitable dark tobacco in the world market to meet the demand of the manufacturers of smokeless tobacco products 
the high price of us leaf relative to the world market has reduced exports  which  combined with declining purchases by us manufacturers  have reduced the amount of us tobacco that can be produced and sold in the united states 
domestic leaf purchases are unlikely to increase because of the continued decline of cigarette consumption in the united states 
exports of us leaf are likely to continue to decline unless the us tobacco program is significantly modified or eliminated  and the competitive position of us leaf improves dramatically 
several proposals to change that program are currently being discussed in the us congress 
these proposals generally call for quota buy out and some modifications in the existing tobacco program 
management believes that a quota buy out will not provide sufficient improvement unless the entire system of government supports is dismantled 
should the declines continue  the company has the risk that its us processing facilities would have excess capacity 
without substantial improvement in the market attractiveness of us leaf  foreign manufacturers are likely to continue to shift their purchases to other tobacco producing areas  such as brazil and africa where the company has significant operations 
on june   the flue cured tobacco cooperative stabilization corporation the cooperative announced that it had signed a purchase agreement with vector group ltd 
vector to acquire vector s leaf processing operation and cigarette plant in timberlake  north carolina 
the 
table of contents company processes tobacco for the cooperative from time to time  and in some years  including fiscal year  the volume is significant to universal s us operations 
the company believes that as a result of this transaction  its us processing volumes could be reduced 
because the company expects that most of the shortfall from the four year decline in zimbabwe tobacco will be replaced with crops from areas where the company contracts with and provides financing to farmers  the company could face increased financing and inventory risk since zimbabwe tobacco is purchased at auction 
the company has been working to expand sources of african tobacco  and those efforts require investments in working capital and operating facilities 
in some cases  the company has financed clearing virgin land and building dams for irrigation  which expands the company s risk profile 
should tobacco production fail to fully develop in areas where the company is making these investments  tobacco volumes may not be sufficient for the company to operate profitably in those areas 
the company expects to benefit from these investments in the form of larger volumes of african leaf beginning in fiscal year the european union  eu has recently taken action toward modifying the system of granting subsidies to tobacco farmers 
the eu subsidy makes up well over half of the revenue that a european farmer receives on a tobacco crop 
for example  in the crop  the net premium on flue cured tobacco paid to farmers was per kilogram  and the average purchase price paid for european flue cured tobacco was around per kilogram 
under the recently announced regime  no change in the current system is foreseen in crop years and which will be reflected in universal s and fiscal years respectively 
beginning with the crop fiscal year and through the crop fiscal year  however  of the subsidy has been decoupled from production 
the decoupling of the subsidy from production essentially means that a farmer can receive the subsidy granted in a reference period even if the farmer does not plant tobacco  so long as he keeps the land associated with that subsidy in good agricultural and environmental conditions 
however  the relevant member states  such as italy  greece  spain  and france  can increase the decoupled portion of the subsidy up to 
the remaining portion of the subsidy  or less shall remain subject to actual production of tobacco 
this means  in practical terms  that the total aid to tobacco farmers remains unchanged 
in each of the company s main european tobacco sources  such as italy  greece  spain  and france  tobacco production and processing is extremely important to the local economy 
consequently  management believes that the major tobacco producing countries will choose not to decouple more than of the subsidy  with the possible exception of some varieties less in demand by the market 
the company does not handle those varieties 
before the end of  the eu commission shall submit to the council of ministers a report on the implementation of the new tobacco subsidy system accompanied by appropriate proposals  if necessary 
in  the whole eu common agricultural policy will be under revision 
unless the system in place for the four crop years is extended to  as a consequence of the interim report prepared by the commission  then the decoupled portion would increase to  while the remaining would be used to finance restructuring activities in the tobacco regions 
the company has operations in new acceding countries  poland and hungary  who joined the eu on may  in those countries  the new system will not be de facto implemented before crop  and in the meantime  tobacco farmers will receive subsidies mainly financed by the domestic budget 
management believes that some farmers will cease tobacco production  mainly in the marginal varieties for which member states will decide to increase decoupling to the maximum and to some extent in the market oriented growths 
this decline in production will accelerate with the crop  unless action is taken to extend the system through year or alternative funds are made available at the national level 
the number of farmers who cease producing tobacco will depend on their efficiencies in production and the purchase price received for their tobacco 
management believes that after the 
table of contents crop  the major influence on the farmers decisions to produce tobacco will be the possibility of increasing commercial prices for green tobaccos 
this will be possible depending on enhanced attention to quality and on whether the system can become more efficient by eliminating unproductive costs 
in addition  confirmed support from european tobacco product manufacturers will be crucial to the long term viability of tobacco production in europe 
management believes that if actions are not taken to increase farmer prices or  alternatively  if the member states do not choose to implement subsidies for tobacco production  the volume of tobacco produced in europe will decline over time 
the company s results of operations would be negatively affected if it were not able to replace any lost volumes of european tobacco 
the recorded value of the company s equity in net fixed assets that could be affected by these changes was approximately million 
in addition  unrealized currency losses for tobacco operations there were million  net of taxes  at march  an important trend in the tobacco industry has been consolidation among manufacturers of tobacco products 
this trend is expected to continue  particularly as further privatization of state monopolies occurs  providing opportunities for acquisitions by international manufacturers 
this concentration could provide additional opportunities for international leaf merchants  including universal 
a key success factor for leaf dealers is the ability to provide customers with the quality of leaf and the level of service they desire at the lowest cost possible 
in addition  the leaf dealers have larger historical market shares with some customers than with others 
consequently  the company s potential growth will be affected by the growth of its major customers  and consolidation of customers may have at least a short term favorable or unfavorable impact on the company s business 
decreased social acceptance of smoking and increased pressure from anti smoking groups have had an ongoing adverse effect on sales of tobacco products  particularly in the united states 
the european union and other countries have also imposed limitations on the advertising of cigarettes 
a significant decrease in global sales of tobacco products brought about by health concerns  decreased social acceptance  advertisement limitations  or other factors would reduce demand for the company s products and services 
a number of foreign governments have also taken or proposed steps to restrict or prohibit cigarette advertising and promotion  to increase taxes on cigarettes  and to discourage cigarette consumption 
a number of such measures are included in the framework treaty on tobacco control  which was negotiated under the auspices of the world health organization 
in some cases  such restrictions are more onerous than those proposed or in effect in the united states 
the french government has enacted tax increases of and in  and preliminary estimates show french cigarette sales falling by to during that year 
it is not known how much of the decline in sales represents changes to roll your own cigarettes or purchases in other countries with lower taxes 
the company cannot predict the extent to which government efforts to reduce tobacco consumption might affect the business of its primary customers 
however  a significant decrease in worldwide tobacco consumption brought about by existing or future governmental laws and regulations would reduce demand for the company s products and services and could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations 
in the nine months ended march   the weakness in the us dollar in relation to the euro benefited the lumber and building products sector  which uses the euro as its functional currency 
further changes in exchange rates will affect the translation of the euro earnings of the company into us dollars 
in addition  a continued decline in construction activity in the netherlands could negatively affect sales volumes and margins 
conversely  an increase of such activity could provide an opportunity for volume and margin expansion 
there are some early indications that economic conditions in europe that ultimately will affect the company s lumber operations are improving 
in may  fitch ratings affirmed the netherlands aaa ratings  citing a return to positive changes in 
table of contents gdp and an economy wide social accord to freeze wages in in addition in may  the european central bank noted the economies making up the eu had grown in the first quarter of at the fastest pace in three years 
the company  through its subsidiaries  is subject to the tax laws of many jurisdictions  and from time to time contests assessments of taxes due 
changes in tax laws or the interpretation of tax laws can affect the company s earnings  as can the resolution of various pending and contested tax issues 
the consolidated income tax rate is affected by a number of factors  including  but not limited to  the mix of domestic and foreign earnings and investments  local tax rates of subsidiaries  repatriation of foreign earnings  and the company s ability to utilize foreign tax credits 
in recent years  the company s domestic income has declined while foreign income has increased 
if this trend continues and tax rates remain constant worldwide  the company s ability to utilize its foreign tax credits could be diminished 
as a result  its consolidated income tax rate could increase 
during the nine months ended march   the company received a significant dividend from a foreign subsidiary that enabled the company to fully utilize its foreign tax credit carryforwards of approximately million 
however  the company expects foreign tax credit carryforwards to be generated in future periods 
factors that may affect future results the foregoing discussion contains certain forward looking statements  which may be identified by phrases such as the company expects or management believes or words of similar effect 
in addition  the company may publish  from time to time  forward looking statements relating to such matters as anticipated financial performance  business prospects  and similar matters 
the following important factors  among other things  in some cases have affected  and in the future could affect  the company s actual results and could cause the company s actual results for a fiscal year and any interim period to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward looking statements made by  or on behalf of  the company 
the company assumes no duty to update any of the statements in this report 
operating factors the leaf tobacco industry is highly competitive and universal is heavily reliant on a few large customers 
the company is one of three major independent global competitors in the highly competitive leaf tobacco industry  all of whom are reliant upon a few large customers 
the loss of one of those large customers or a significant decrease in their respective demand for the company s products or services could further increase competition and significantly decrease the company s sales of products or services  which would have a material adverse effect on universal s results of operations 
the competition among leaf tobacco merchants is based on the ability to meet customer specifications in the buying  processing  and financing of tobacco  as well as the price charged for products and services 
however  because universal  like its competitors  relies upon a few significant customers  the consolidation or failure of any of these large or significant customers could contribute to a significant decrease in its sales of products and services 

table of contents the company s financial results can be significantly affected by the changes in the balance of supply and demand for leaf tobacco or other agricultural products 
because universal is a leaf tobacco merchant  its financial results can be significantly affected by changes in the overall balance of worldwide supply and demand for leaf tobacco 
the demand for tobacco  which is based upon customers expectations of their future tobacco requirements  can change from time to time depending upon internal and external factors affecting the demand for their products 
the company s customers expectations  and thus their demand for leaf tobacco  is influenced by a number of factors  including trends in the global consumption of cigarettes  such as health concerns and the growth or decline in popularity of american blend cigarettes  trends in sales of cigars and other tobacco products  and levels of competition 
the total supply of tobacco at any given time is a function of current tobacco production and the volumes of uncommitted stocks of processed tobacco from prior years production 
production of tobacco in a given year may be significantly affected by such factors as the amount of tobacco planted by farmers throughout the world  weather fluctuations  and crop disease 
any significant change in these factors could cause a material imbalance in the supply and demand for tobacco  which would affect the company s results of operations 
similar factors can affect results for its agri products businesses 
in areas where universal purchases its leaf tobacco directly from farmers  the company bears the risk that the tobacco it receives will not meet quality and quantity requirements 
in countries where universal contracts directly with tobacco farmers  including argentina  brazil  italy  the united states  and several african countries  the company bears the risk that the tobacco delivered will not meet quality and quantity requirements 
if the tobacco does not meet such market requirements  the company may not be able to meet all of its customers orders  which would have an adverse effect on its profitability and its results of operations 
in us markets  the high price of us tobacco magnifies the risk of purchasing tobacco that does not meet those requirements 
in addition  in many foreign countries  when universal purchases tobacco directly from farmers  it provides them with financing 
unless the company receives marketable tobacco that meets the quality and quantity specifications of its customers  it bears the risk that it will not be able to fully recover its crop advances or recover them in a reasonable period of time 
the company also has dark leaf tobacco growing operations in indonesia and brazil  where it has similar financing risks 
although the company purchases a portion of its leaf tobacco through public auction  as well as privately negotiated contract purchases  several countries where auction markets are used today may be moving toward direct purchasing  thus increasing the areas subject to this risk 

table of contents weather and other conditions can affect the marketability of the company s products 
tobacco and many other agricultural crops that the company buys  such as sunflower seeds and tea  are subject to vagaries of the weather and the environment that can  in some cases  change the quality or size of the crops 
if a weather event is particularly severe  such as a major drought or hurricane  the affected crop could be destroyed or damaged to an extent that it would be less desirable to manufacturers  which would result in a reduction in revenues 
if such an event is also widespread  it could affect the company s ability to acquire the quantity of products required by its customers 
in addition  other items can affect the marketability of tobacco and other agricultural products  including  among other things  the presence of non tobacco related material  genetically modified organisms  and excess residues of pesticides  fungicides  and herbicides 
a significant event impacting the condition or quality of a large amount of any of the crops that universal buys could make it difficult for the company to sell these products or to fill customers orders 
a significant slowdown in home improvement or construction markets in the netherlands could have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
the majority of the customers who purchase lumber and building products from universal are located in the netherlands 
therefore  a significant slowdown in the home improvement or construction market in the netherlands could reduce demand for these products  which would have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
regulatory and governmental factors government efforts to reduce tobacco consumption could have a significant impact on the businesses of universal s customers  which would  in turn  affect the company s results of operations 
the us federal government and certain state and local governments have taken or proposed actions that may have the effect of reducing us consumption of tobacco products and indirectly reducing demand for the company s products and services 
these activities have included the us environmental protection agency s decision to classify environmental tobacco smoke as a group a known human carcinogen  restrictions on the use of tobacco products in public places and places of employment  proposals to have the us food and drug administration regulate nicotine as a drug and sharply restrict cigarette advertising and promotion  proposals to increase the federal and state excise taxes on cigarettes  and the policy of the us government to link certain federal grants to the enforcement of state laws restricting the sale of tobacco products 

table of contents numerous other legislative and regulatory anti smoking measures have been proposed at the federal  state  and local levels 
excluding the effect of tobacco contained in cigarettes imported into the united states  the company estimates that between and of the flue cured and burley tobaccos that it handles worldwide is ultimately consumed in the united states 
universal s tobacco sales consist primarily of flue cured and burley tobaccos  which  along with oriental tobaccos  are the major ingredients in american blend cigarettes 
a number of foreign governments have also taken or proposed steps to restrict or prohibit cigarette advertising and promotion  to increase taxes on cigarettes  and to discourage cigarette consumption 
a number of such measures are included in the framework treaty on tobacco control  which was negotiated under the auspices of the world health organization 
in some cases  such restrictions are more onerous than those proposed or in effect in the united states 
the company cannot predict the extent to which government efforts to reduce tobacco consumption might affect the business of its primary customers 
however  a significant decrease in worldwide tobacco consumption brought about by existing or future governmental laws and regulations would reduce demand for the company s products and services and could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations 
because universal conducts a significant portion of its operations internationally  political uncertainties in certain countries could have an adverse effect on its performance and results of operations 
the company s international operations are subject to uncertainties and risks relating to the political stability of certain foreign governments  principally in developing countries and emerging markets  and to the effects of changes in the trade policies and economic regulations of foreign governments 
these uncertainties and risks  which include  among other factors  undeveloped or antiquated commercial law and the expropriation or nationalization of assets  may adversely impact the company s ability to effectively manage its operations in those countries 
for example  in the past  universal has experienced significant year to year fluctuations in earnings due to changes in the brazilian government s economic policies  and government actions in zimbabwe have reduced the tobacco crop there  causing the company to shift sourcing of tobacco to other countries 
universal has substantial capital investments in south america and africa  and the performance of its operations in these regions can materially affect its earnings from tobacco operations 
if the political situation in any of the countries where the company conducts business were to deteriorate significantly  the company s ability to recover assets located there could be impaired 
to the extent that universal does not replace any lost volumes of tobacco with tobacco from other sources  or incurs increased costs related to such replacement  its results of operations would suffer 
financial factors failure of universal s customers or farmers to repay extensions of credit could materially impact the company s results of operations 
universal extends credit to both farmers and customers 
a significant delay in payment or a significant bad debt provision related to amounts due to the company could adversely affect its results of operations 
in addition  crop advances to farmers are generally secured by the farmers agreement to deliver green tobacco 
in the event of crop failure  recovery of advances could be delayed until future crops are delivered 

table of contents failure of foreign banks in which universal s subsidiaries deposit funds or the failure to transfer funds or honor withdrawals may affect its results of operations 
funds held by the company s foreign subsidiaries are often deposited in their local banks 
in certain circumstances  the company s ability to gain access to these funds could be impaired  which could have a material adverse effect on universal s results of operations 
banks in certain foreign jurisdictions may be subject to a higher rate of failure or may not honor withdrawals of deposited funds 
in addition  the countries in which these local banks operate may lack sufficient regulatory oversight or suffer from structural weaknesses in the local banking system 
due to uncertainties and risks relating to the political stability of certain foreign governments  these local banks also may be subject to exchange controls and therefore unable to perform transfers of certain currencies 
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates may affect universal s results of operations 
although the international tobacco trade generally is conducted in us dollars  thereby limiting foreign exchange risk to that which is related to production costs  overhead  and income taxes in the source country  the company s purchases of tobacco are often made in local currency 
as a result  changes in local currency can make a particular crop more or less attractive in the world market thereby affecting the profitability of such crop and universal s results of operations 
because there is no forward foreign exchange market in many of the major countries where the company sources tobacco  universal manages its foreign exchange risk by matching funding for inventory purchases with the currency of sale and by minimizing its net investment in these countries 
to the extent that the company is not able to continue match funding  or otherwise hedge its exposure  the company could have a disproportionate exposure to local currency in which the tobacco was purchased 
certain of the company s operations use their local currency as the functional currency 
for example  the lumber and building products operations  which are based in the netherlands  use the euro as their functional currency 
in certain tobacco markets that are primarily domestic  the company uses the local currency as the functional currency 
examples of these domestic markets are hungary and poland 
in each case  reported earnings are affected by the translation of the local currency into the us dollar 
see also qualitative and quantitative disclosure about market risk 
in universal s tobacco business  customers usually pre finance purchases or pay market rates of interest for inventory purchased on order 
because of changes in financial markets  the company  like many others  has moved away from short term credit markets 
the company is borrowing more long term debt  and through hedging agreements  it is swapping the interest rates on its existing fixed rate debt to floating market interest rates to better match the interest rates that the company charges its customers 
to the extent universal is unable to match these interest rates  a decrease in interest rates could increase its net financing costs 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rates interest rate risk is limited in the tobacco business because customers usually pre finance purchases or pay market rates of interest for inventory purchased for their accounts 
the company s tobacco customers pay interest on tobacco purchased for their order 
that interest is paid at rates based on current markets for variable rate debt 
if universal were to fund its committed tobacco inventory with fixed rate debt  the company might not be able to recover interest at that fixed rate if current market interest rates were to fall 
as of march   tobacco inventory of million included million in inventory that was committed for sale to customers and million 
table of contents that was not committed 
committed inventory  after deducting million in customer deposits  represents the company s net exposure of million 
universal maintains a substantial portion of its debt at variable interest rates in order to substantially mitigate interest rate risk related to carrying fixed rate debt 
debt carried at variable interest rates was million at march  although a hypothetical change in short term interest rates would result in a change in annual interest expense of approximately million  about of that amount could be offset with changes in charges to customers 
currency the international tobacco trade generally is conducted in us dollars  thereby limiting foreign exchange risk to that which is related to production costs  overhead  and income taxes in the source country 
most of the tobacco operations are accounted for using the us dollar as the functional currency 
because there are no forward foreign exchange markets in many of universal s major countries of tobacco origin  the company manages its foreign exchange risk by matching funding for inventory purchases with the currency of sale  which is usually the us dollar  and by minimizing its net investment in individual countries 
in these countries  the company is vulnerable to currency gains and losses to the extent that any local currency balances do not offset each other 
the company recognized a thousand exchange loss due to remeasurement for the nine month transitional year ended march   versus a million remeasurement gain and a million remeasurement loss for the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively 
the company recognized million in exchange gains from foreign currency transactions for the transition year ended march   versus exchange losses of thousand and million for the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively 
the lumber and building products operations  which are based in the netherlands  use the euro as their functional currency 
in certain tobacco markets that are primarily domestic  the company uses the local currency as the functional currency 
examples of these domestic markets are hungary and poland 
in each case  reported earnings are affected by the translation of the local currency into the us dollar 
commodity universal uses commodity futures in its rubber trading business to reduce the risk of price fluctuations 
the company does not enter into rubber contracts for trading purposes 
all forward commodity contracts are adjusted to fair market value during the year  and gains and losses are recorded in income at that time 
the amounts recorded during   and were not material 
derivatives policies hedging interest rate exposure using swaps and hedging foreign exchange exposure using forward contracts are specifically contemplated to manage risk in keeping with management s policies 
universal may use derivative instruments  such as swaps  forwards  or futures  which are based directly or indirectly upon interest rates  currencies  and commodities  to manage and reduce the risks inherent in interest rate  currency  and price fluctuations 
the company does not utilize derivatives for speculative purposes  and it does not enter into market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
derivatives are transaction specific so that a specific debt instrument  contract  or invoice determines the amount  maturity  and other specifics of the hedge 
counterparty risk is limited to institutions with long term debt ratings of a or better
