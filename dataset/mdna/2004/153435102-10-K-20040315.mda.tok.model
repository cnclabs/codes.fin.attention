using exchanges rates as at december  and  the zloty in comparison to the us dollar appreciated by in and in in order to aid understanding  we have prepared tables which segment the income statement information as presented in the financial statements into those elements of the income statement which relate to operations acquired by the company during the reporting period and those which relate to operations owned in both reporting periods 
key definitions are total operations this is the extract from the income statement for total operations for the fiscal year ended december  operations acquired this is the elimination from total operations of activities acquired in operations acquired these are the eliminations of the amounts generated in by subsidiaries acquired in for the corresponding pre acquisition period of so as to present continuing operations based on comparable operations 
for example  if we acquired a subsidiary on may   operations acquired includes the amounts generated by that subsidiary during the period january  to april  which represents the corresponding pre acquisition period 
continuing operations the amounts for generated by the same subsidiaries owned in and for the same corresponding period 
total operations this is the extract from the income statement for total operations for the fiscal year ended december  readers will also find frequent references to the term cash on delivery cod 
normal trade terms from our polish vodka suppliers are days  however  we are offered by some of these suppliers significant discounts if we pay for goods when delivered 
the discounts offered are considerably in excess of the effective rate we would pay for day term borrowings under our bank facilities 
we will later refer to cod in discussions regarding margin growth and short term banking facilities

table of contents net sales total net sales for increased by  or million  to million 
net sales from continuing operations increased  or million  to million from a base figure of million for the change of excise rates on polish vodka as of october  had an adverse effect on our third quarter sales as the supply change de stocked in anticipation of the change 
we had anticipated being able to recover these sales as the supply chain re stocked in the fourth quarter and as sales  which had previously been lost to unofficial channels came through normal supply lines 
as a result of both the restocking and the migration of unofficial sales to normal channels  total net sales for the three months ended december  was million as compared to million for the same period of  an increase of 
of the million  million relates to acquisitions and million from continuing operations  which represents a core growth rate year over year 
gross profit total gross profit on sales increased by or million 
when expressed as a percentage of sales  gross margins were for both years 
while core gross margins have increased to  the new businesses acquired in achieved a margin of 
because these newly acquired businesses contributed of the total gross margin  the lower margin achieved in these units had a dilutive effect on the whole 
the improvement in the margins can be attributed to both the improved terms reached with suppliers following the acquisitions of damianex and agis which  in turn  reflected back into the pre acquisition group  and to the company s ongoing program of migrating its client base from second tier distributors towards retailers and on premise accounts 
operating expenses total selling  general and administrative s  g a expenses increased from million in to million in when expressed as a percentage of sales  total s  g a decreased from for to for this improvement is attributable to both improvement in core s  g a  which fell to  and to the significantly lower cost basis achieved by the new acquisitions which operate in provincial areas 
the reduction in core s  g a has resulted from ongoing reviews of operations both in terms of staffing levels and in the choice of suppliers  and terms achieved on the delivery of goods and services to the whole group 
depreciation of fixed assets and equipment increased by from  in to million in the increase is attributable to the amount of assets acquired with damianex and agis 
on core operations  depreciation has increased  mainly due to the introduction of new business software in three of the subsidiaries 
amortization of goodwill and trademarks has decreased by  from  for to  for this reduction is primarily the result of the application of the requirements of fsab  which no longer allows the company to amortize goodwill but instead require companies to perform regular impairment reviews 
the company has performed an impairment review and concluded that no adjustment is required 
the company amortizes trademarks over a year period 
bad debt expense in total increased or  from  for to million for this increase has mainly attributable to continuing operations as management has focused on the aging of its 
table of contents receivables in light of the current economic situation in poland 
as a percentage of sales  the provision represents for compared to for  which is within management guidelines of to of sales 
operating income total operating income increased  or million  to million for expressed as a percentage of sales  total operating income for was at as opposed to for core operating income increased from million for to million for the significant increase in operating margins is a direct result of the company s ability to leverage its size from both the buy side and the sell side of its gross margins 
in addition  the company has also been able to leverage its position on overhead reduction through centralizing contracts for items such as gasoline  insurance  leasing  trucks  telecommunications  office and warehouse supplies 
during the fourth quarter of  the company refined its inventory valuation method to better estimate direct costs incurred in bringing the inventory to its existing condition and location 
this change in estimate resulted in a net increase to operating profit of  interest expense total net interest expense increased  or  from million for to million for as a percentage of sales  total interest fell from in to in interest cover has increased from times in to times in during  interest rates fell significantly in poland from an average of in to in the company increased its debt level during primarily to fund its acquisitions of damianex  agis and onufry  which added approximately million to long term debt 
as mentioned in the overview  the company makes extensive use of cod rebates when the discount offered is significantly better than the effective rate of bank borrowing 
while taking advantage of cod terms increases the company s short term borrowings and interest expense  we believe it also results in improved overall margins 
net realized and unrealized foreign currency losses the net charge relating to foreign exchange losses increased to  for versus a net charge of  for since  the company has tried to contain the foreign exchange risk on its non polish zloty denominated debt through the use of hedging instruments which as a rule are expensive in poland compared to more establish markets and it is this which was behind the increase 
in november  the company made the decision to migrate virtually all of its long term acquisition debt from us dollars and euro into polish zloty 
the company feels that the reduction in local interest rates justified this move as it also allowed the company to eliminate the main source of potential foreign exchange movements 
income tax the total tax charge for was million  which represented of pre tax profits 
for  the charge was million  which represented of pre tax profits 
the monetary increase in income tax has been primarily due to the increase in pre tax profits from million to million 
during  the company has undergone an analysis of its bad debt provisions following a change in polish tax law which became effective in  allowing for the accelerated tax deductability on unpaid debts 
following this analysis  the company was able to process more of its provisions through its statutory books and form a more definitive opinion on the recoverability of the amounts included within the deferred tax asset 
as a result of this review  the company has concluded that a valuation allowance is no longer appropriate which reduced the current year income tax charge by  and the effective rate by 
net income total net income increased by  or million  to million for compared to a total net income of million for the increase was due to the factors noted above 

table of contents statement of liquidity and capital resources in  the company s operating activities absorbed million as opposed to absorbing million in operating cash flows are generated by or absorbed by cash earnings defined as net earnings as adjusted for non cash expense income items such as depreciation 
movements in working capital  primarily the movements of trade receivables and payables as well as inventory 
movements in other current assets and liabilities 
in tabular form  the sources and uses of operating cash flows can be summarized as year ended december  all values s cash earnings movement in trade receivables movement in inventory movement in days payable subtotal of movements in working capital movements in other current assets liabilities net cash used in generated by operating activities movement in cod support pro forma cash generated by operating activities the need for additional working capital was at its highest at december  due to the strong seasonality of sales which resulted in december sales being of full year sales 
this working capital requirement was further affected by our acquisition of multi ex in mid november 
the net cash used in operating activities is affected by the company s use of cod terms 
use of cod  where the company waives its day payment terms in exchange for additional early settlement discounts  effectively replaces with bank funding the support a business would normally receive from suppliers in managing overall working capital needs 
the effect of presenting the movement in cod would be to show an increase in funds generated by operations while showing a reduction in funding 
the increased use of cod in has been driven both by increased activity and an increase in the percentage of purchases to which we attach cod terms 
for  the percentage of cod from domestic suppliers was whereas for it was 
december  pro forma sales full year including pre acquisition pro forma cost of goods sold full year including pre acquisition debtor days excluding vat of inventory days excluding vat of days payable excluding vat of net working capital days the company has paid particular attention to debtor management over the past two years driving down both debtor days and allowances for doubtful debts 
inventory rotation has remained stable at times a year 
days payable is a function of the amount of cod purchases the company decides to make  a point indicated in both of the above tables 
investing activities amounted to million in and are in most part related to the acquisitions of dako galant  panta hurt and multi ex 
in addition  the company has been upgrading its it systems as well as starting the construction of its new regional distribution center in the southeast of poland 
during  the investing activities amounted to million which was primarily for the acquisitions of agis and damianex 

table of contents financing activities generated a total of million  of which million was the net proceeds of the private placement of the company s common stock in march the company also received million as a result of option holders exercising their options during the year 
the receipt of these funds enabled the company to reduce its debt during the year  although this has returned to a similar level as the previous year following the recent acquisitions 
the nature of the company s business is that it has to invest in working capital  mainly polish vodka on cod terms  towards the end of the calendar year  which is traditionally its busiest selling period 
with this in mind  the company arranged for various short term funds to be available to it which increased total debt by approximately million 
at december   the company had million of unused credit facilities available to it under these short term agreements 
total forward contracted obligations are obligations under property leases capital leases bank repayments facility expiry totals it should be noted that the million bank repayment relates only to the expiry of the current short term overdraft and loan facilities 
the company does not foresee and problems in renewing these facilities 
statement on inflation and currency fluctuations inflation in poland was for as compared to in the company s operating cash flows and virtually all of its assets are denominated in polish zloty 
in november  the company migrated nearly all its term loan facilities from us dollar and euro to polish zloty denominated loans 
the company is exposed to translation risk arising from the restatement of its financial statements from polish zloty to us dollars 

table of contents seasonality the company s net sales have been historically seasonable with on average of the net sales occurring in the fourth quarter 
during  net sales in the fourth quarter represented of full year sales compared to for the fourth quarter of the quarterly figure for was higher because of the recovery following the excise tax change on october  the table below demonstrates the movement and significance of seasonality on the income statement 
first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter net sales seasonality gross profit gross margin operating income net income net income per common share diluted includes purchase of dako galant 
includes purchases of damianex and agis includes purchase of panta hurt includes purchase of multi ex includes purchase of onufry the company s working capital requirements are also seasonal  and are normally highest in the months of december and january 
liquidity then normally improves as collections are made on the seasonally higher fourth quarter receivables 
critical accounting policies and estimates general the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of net sales  expenses  assets and liabilities 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 

table of contents revenue and margin recognition the company only recognizes revenue and margin when goods have been shipped to customers on the basis of a validated customer order and where a delivery acceptance note as signed by the customer has been returned to the company 
sales are stated net of customer discounts and sales tax 
expenses the company recognizes expenses in the period in which either the cost is incurred or in the period in which the associated revenue and margin have been recognized 
provisions for doubtful debts the company makes general provision for doubtful debt based on the aging of its trade receivables 
where circumstances require  the company will make specific provision for any excess not provided for under the general provision 
inventory because of the nature of the products supplied by the company  great attention is paid to inventory rotation 
where goods are estimated to obsolete or unmarketable they are written down to a value reflecting the saleable value in their relevant condition 
during the fourth quarter of  the company changed its inventory valuation methodology to better reflect the impact of volume related supplier discounts and the costs associated with storage and handling 
the basis of the adjustment is to reduce inventory and thereby reduce operating profit by the amount of volume related supplier bonuses deemed to be within closing inventory 
against this an allocation of overheads which are attributable to inventory receipt and storage is added to inventory and thereby increases operating profit 
goodwill and intangibles acquired goodwill is no longer amortized as required by fasb instead the company assesses the recoverability of its goodwill at least once a year or whenever adverse events or changes in circumstances or business climate indicate that expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges for individual business units may not be sufficient to support the recorded goodwill 
if undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to support the goodwill  an impairment charge would be recognized to reduce the carrying value of the goodwill based on the expected discounted cash flows of the business unit 
no such charge has been considered necessary through the date of the accompanying financial statements 
intangibles trademarks are amortized over ten years 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 
fin 
fin requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
the disclosure provisions of fin are effective for financial statements initially issued after january  public entities with a variable interest in a variable interest entity created before february  shall apply the consolidation requirements of fin to that entity no later than the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning after june  fin is effective for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after january  adoption of fin is not expected to have a significant impact on the financial statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk exchange rate fluctuations translation risks the company s operations are conducted primarily in poland and its functional currency is the polish zloty and its reporting currency is the us dollar 
the company s financial instruments consist mainly of cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  accounts payable and receivable  inventories  bank loans  overdraft facilities and long term debt 
all of the monetary assets represented by these financial instruments are located in poland  consequently  they are subject to currency translation risk when reporting in us dollars 
if the us dollar increases in value against the polish zloty  the value in us dollars of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses originally recorded in polish zloty will decrease 
conversely  if the us dollar decreases in value against the polish zloty  the value in us dollars of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses originally recorded in polish zloty will increase 
thus  increases and decreases in the value of the us dollar can have an impact on the value in us dollar of our non us dollar assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  even if the value of these items has not changed in their original currency 
transaction risk commercial exposure 
our commercial foreign exchange exposure mainly arises from the purchase of imported alcoholic beverage in currencies other than our functional currency of the polish zloty 
thus  accounts payable for imported beverages are billed in various currencies and the company is subject to short term changes in the currency markets for product purchases 
the company also operates a bonded warehouse where the inventory acquired from foreign suppliers is recorded in its source currency 
thus  any currency movement on trade payables resulting from either a strengthening or weakening of the polish zloty against a foreign suppliers currency is often compensated for by an opposite movement relating to inventories recorded in the imported currency 
below is a table indicating the respective trade payable and imported inventory in us dollars usd  british pounds sterling gbp and euro eur 
please note that on january   the euro became the functional currency across the euro zone  and therefore items disclosed as eur may actually have been initially recorded in the base currency of december  these have been restated to euro to reflect the corresponding settlement risk

table of contents financial exposure 
our general policy requires our subsidiaries to borrow funds and invest excess cash in the same currency as their functional currency  the polish zloty  where these funds are needed for and generated by operations 
where funds are needed for investment and acquisition purposes in previous years  they have been taken in u 
s dollar and euro 
in november  the company decided that the reducing interest rate differential between polish and us base rates no longer justified the exposure to foreign exchange losses on the non polish denominated debt 
therefore  the company decided to transfer the majority  approximately  of its acquisition debt to polish denominated debt 
total exposure to various currencies on the company s bank funding for december  and is given in the table below 
year of maturity thousands of usd bank loans payable in usd bank loans payable in polish zloty bank overdrafts payable in polish zloty total bank funding loans with a contractual term of one year have been automatically renewed in the past and the company expects them to be renewed in the future 
bank loans and overdrafts denominated in polish zloty are also renewable after one year and have been presented according to their legal form 
more details of the repayments dates and conditions of both the short term and long term loans can be found in note of the financial statements 
bank borrowings are sensitive to interest and foreign currency market risks as they usually bear interest at variable rates and are denominated in various currencies 
in  the company increased management of its currency risk through the use of forward contracts for periods between three and six months 
however  in november  the company decided that the reduced interest rates in poland and the uncertainty of currency markets warranted the conversion of all debt into polish zloty 
this reconfiguration of the loan portfolio meant that the company no longer requires uses forward exchange contracts 
exchange rates december  december  polish zloty us dollar polish zloty euro interest rate fluctuations the company may have an exposure to interest rate movements through its bank deposits and indebtedness 
the company does not enter into any hedging arrangements in regards to its interest risk exposure ie  interest rate swaps or forward rate agreements 
because all of the company s debts are at floating rates  changes in interest rates may impact its net interest expense  positively by way of a reduction in base rates and adversely should base rates rise 
the company s sensitivity to interest rate movements is expressed in the table below
