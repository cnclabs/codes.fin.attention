critical accounting policies the process of preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the carrying values of the company s consolidated assets and liabilities as well as recognition of revenues and expenses 
these estimates and judgments are based on the company s historical experience  actuarial assumptions and understanding of current facts and circumstances 
certain of the company s accounting policies are considered critical  as these policies are important to the presentation of the company s consolidated financial statements and require significant or complex judgment by management 
management has identified the practices used to determine the allowance for doubtful accounts associated with trade accounts receivable  the liability for both unpaid and unreported dental  medical and workers compensation claims  the liability for pension and postretirement and postemployment benefit obligations  and the accounting and related impairment testing of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
 as critical accounting policies involving the use of estimates and judgments 
the company evaluates its allowance for doubtful trade accounts receivable based on customers credit history  payment trends  current aging analysis and other economic factors to the extent available 
it is possible that reported results could be different based upon the customers ability and willingness to pay amounts billed 
the company evaluates its liability for unpaid and unreported dental  medical and workers compensation claims based on historical payment trends and administration costs present for the company and also generally present in the united states 
the company uses actuarial assumptions to calculate estimated future claim costs based on historical trends 
reported results could be different if historical trends differ from actual payment results 
the company evaluates its liability for pension and postretirement and postemployment benefit plans based upon estimates and actuarial assumptions of future plan service costs  future interest costs on projected benefit obligations  rates of compensation increases  employee turnover rates  anticipated mortality rates  expected investment returns on plan assets  asset allocation assumptions of plan assets  and other factors 
if management used different estimates and assumptions regarding these plans  the funded status of the plans could vary significantly and the company could recognize different amounts of expense from the amounts reported over future periods 
the company has identified the accounting and related impairment testing of sfas no 
as a critical accounting policy having a material impact on the company s financial presentation 
sfas no 
 among other things  eliminates the amortization of goodwill and certain identified intangible assets 
the company tests intangible assets  including goodwill  that are not subject to amortization for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired  using a two step impairment assessment 
the first step of the impairment test identifies potential impairment and compares the fair value with their carrying amount  including goodwill 
the company evaluates impairment at each of its st 
louis  pni  and tucson reporting units 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying amount  goodwill is not considered impaired  and the second step of the impairment test is not necessary 
if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value  the second step of the impairment test shall be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 the company conducted the first step of impairment tests as of the beginning of its fiscal year 
the company assessed the fair value by considering each reporting unit s expected future cash flows  recent purchase prices paid for entities within its 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued industry  and the company s market capitalization 
the company s discounted cash flow evaluation utilizes a discount rate that corresponds to the company s weighted average cost of capital 
given consideration of these factors  the company concluded that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded the carrying amounts of its net assets and  accordingly  no impairment loss was recognized 
subsequent annual impairment tests indicate that the fair value of the reporting units continues to exceed their carrying amounts 
subsequent impairments  if any  would be classified as operating expense 
if management used different estimates and assumptions for future cash flows  weighted average cost  tax rates and other estimates and assumptions used in determining the fair value of each of the company s reporting units  the results of the company s impairment testing could vary significantly from the results reported above

merger agreement indemnification pursuant to the merger agreement  pulitzer inc is obligated to indemnify hearst argyle television  inc hearst argyle against losses related to i on an after tax basis  certain tax liabilities  including a any transfer tax liability attributable to the spin off  b with certain exceptions  any tax liability of old pulitzer  or any subsidiary of old pulitzer attributable to any tax period or portion thereof ending on or before the closing date of the merger  including tax liabilities resulting from the spin off  and c any tax liability of pulitzer inc or any subsidiary of pulitzer inc  ii liabilities and obligations under any employee benefit plans not assumed by hearst argyle  and iii certain other matters as set forth in the merger agreement 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued internal revenue services matters in october the internal revenue service irs formally proposed that old pulitzer s taxable income for the tax year ended march  be increased by approximately million based on the assertion that old pulitzer was required to recognize a taxable gain in that amount as a result of the spin off 
pulitzer inc is obligated under the merger agreement to indemnify hearst argyle against any tax liability attributable to the spin off and has the right to control any proceedings relating to the determination of such tax liability 
if the irs were completely successful in its proposed adjustment  the company s indemnification obligation would be approximately million  plus applicable interest 
any income tax indemnification payment would be recorded as an adjustment to additional paid in capital  and any related interest expense would be reflected as a component of net income in the period recognized 
the company does not believe that old pulitzer realized any taxable gain in connection with the spin off  and in january  it contested the irs proposed increase in a formal written protest filed with the irs appeals office 
in a recent letter addressed to the company s representatives  the irs appeals officer indicated that he supports the position asserted by the irs and is inclined to sustain substantially the entire amount of the irs proposed increase in old pulitzer s taxable income 
the company s representatives have responded to the irs appeals officer s letter and are continuing their discussions regarding the company s position 
while there can be no assurance that the company will completely prevail in its position  it continues to believe that the irs position is not supported by the facts or applicable legal authority 
the company intends to vigorously contest the irs determination and has not accrued any liability in connection with this matter 
if the company and the irs are unable to resolve their differences in the irs appeals office  the company likely will pursue its case before the united states tax court 
potential income tax refund on august   the company  on behalf of old pulitzer  filed with the irs amended federal corporate income tax returns for the years ended december and and march in which refunds of tax in the aggregate amount of approximately million  plus interest  were claimed 
these refund claims were based on the company s contention that old pulitzer was entitled to deduct certain fees and expenses which it had not previously deducted and which old pulitzer had incurred in connection with its investigation of several strategic alternatives and potential transactions prior to its decision to proceed with the broadcast transaction 
under the merger agreement  the company is entitled to any amounts recovered from the irs as a result of these refund claims  although there can be no assurance that the irs will approve all or any portion of these refund claims 
discussions between the company s representatives and the irs regarding these refund claims have only recently commenced  and no receivable has been recognized in connection with these refund claims 
any income tax refunds would be recorded as an adjustment to additional paid in capital  and any related interest received would be reflected as a component of net income in the period recognized 
provision for income taxes the company has incurred capital losses that exceed capital gains available during the prescribed carry back periods by approximately million 
the company expects to generate capital gains of at least this amount during prescribed carry forward periods

in the company adopted sfas no 
 which requires an intangible asset that is acquired to be initially recognized and measured based on its fair value 
the statement also provides that goodwill and other 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued indefinite lived intangible assets should not be amortized  but shall be tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if circumstances indicate potential impairment  through a comparison of fair value to their carrying amount 
sfas no 
 among other things  eliminates the amortization of goodwill and certain identified intangible assets 
the company tests intangible assets  including goodwill  that are not subject to amortization for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired  using a two step impairment assessment 
the first step of the impairment test identifies potential impairment and compares the fair value with their carrying amount  including goodwill 
the company evaluates impairment at each of its st 
louis  pni  and tucson reporting units 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying amount  goodwill is not considered impaired  and the second step of the impairment test is not necessary 
if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value  the second step of the impairment test shall be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 the company conducted the first step of impairment tests as of the beginning of its fiscal year 
the company assessed the fair value by considering each reporting unit s expected future cash flows  recent purchase prices paid for entities within its industry  and the company s market capitalization 
the company s discounted cash flow evaluation utilizes a discount rate that corresponds to the company s weighted average cost of capital 
given consideration of these factors  the company concluded that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded the carrying amounts of its net assets and  accordingly  no impairment loss was recognized 
subsequent annual impairment tests indicate that the fair value of the reporting units continue to exceed their carrying amounts 
subsequent impairments  if any  would be classified as operating expense

in december  the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of the act  was signed into law 
the act introduced a prescription drug benefit under medicare medicare part d and a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent as that term is defined in the act to medicare part d

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk newsprint the primary raw material used in the company s operations is newsprint  representing percent to percent of operating expenses over the last five years 
for  the company consumed approximately  metric tonnes of newsprint  including its percent share related to the operations of tni partners 
based on the company s current level of newspaper operations  expected annual newsprint consumption for is estimated to be in the range of  metric tonnes 
historically  newsprint has been subject to significant price fluctuations from year to year  unrelated in many cases to general economic conditions 
in the last five years  the company s average annual cost per metric tonne of newsprint has varied from its lowest price by approximately percent 
for every one dollar change in the company s average annual cost per metric tonne of newsprint  pre tax income would change by approximately  assuming annual newsprint consumption of  metric tonnes 
the company attempts to obtain the best price available by combining newsprint purchases for its different newspaper locations with those of other newspaper companies 
the company considers its relationship with newsprint producers to be good 
the company has not entered into derivative contracts for newsprint 
the following chart illustrates fluctuations in newsprint price per metric tonne from january to december as calculated by resources information systems  inc risi performance graph

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk continued loan swaps at december   the company had million of outstanding debt pursuant to the loan 
the loan bears interest at a fixed annual rate of percent 
consequently  if held to maturity  the loan will not expose the company to market risks associated with general fluctuations in interest rates 
the company is a party to two interest rate swap contracts that convert a portion of the company s fixed rate debt to a variable rate 
the interest rate swaps have a combined million notional amount and mature on april  under the terms of the agreements  the company pays interest at a variable rate based upon libor plus a combined adjustment average of percent and receives interest at a fixed rate of percent 
the floating interest rates re price semiannually 
the company accounts for the swaps as fair value hedges and employs the short cut method 
these transactions result in approximately percent of the company s long term interest cost being subject to variable interest rates 
as of december   the fair value of the interest rate swaps represented an unrealized gain of million  which is offset by an unrealized loss of million on the related portion of the company s long term debt 
changes in market interest rates may cause the company to incur higher or lower net interest expense 
for example  for every percent change in the variable interest rates associated with the company s interest swaps  the company s interest expense would change by approximately million
