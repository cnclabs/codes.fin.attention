with respect to accounts managed pursuant to its long only equity strategies  levco generally receives advisory fees based on a percentage of the market value of assets under management  including market appreciation or depreciation and client contributions and withdrawals 
in some cases  levco receives performance based fees from accounts pursuing long only equity strategies 
with respect to private investment vehicles and separate accounts managed pursuant to similar strategies  levco is generally entitled to receive both a fixed management fee based on a percentage of the assets under management and a share of net profits 
at december   assets under management at levco were billion  compared to billion a year earlier 
following is a comparison of levco s assets under management as defined by product and client type at december  in millions long only accounts institutional accounts    sub advisory accounts    non institutional accounts    wrap fee accounts    alternative strategies event driven accounts    long short accounts short biased accounts other private investment funds total    levco also has a wholly owned broker dealer subsidiary that clears through csc on a fully disclosed basis

the following discussion and analysis of the results of operations is based on the consolidated statements of financial condition at december   and  and the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december   and of bkf capital group  inc and subsidiaries which are included elsewhere herein and should be read in conjunction with such financial statements 
it should be noted that certain affiliated investment partnerships in which bkf may be deemed to have a controlling interest have been consolidated 
the number and identity of the partnerships being consolidated may change over time as the percentage interest held by bkf and its affiliates in affiliated investment partnerships changes 
the assets  liabilities and related operations of these partnerships and related minority interest have been reflected in the consolidated financial statements for the annual periods ended december  and the consolidation of the partnerships does not impact bkf s equity or net income

liquidity and capital resources bkf s current assets as of december  consist primarily of cash  short term investments  advisory fees receivable and marketable equity securities 
while bkf s daily business operations are not generally capital intensive  bkf utilizes capital to develop and seed new investment products 
the development of new products is an important element in bkf s business plan  and such seed capital investments may require substantial financial resources 
due to its relatively small size  bkf may consider a number of options to obtain such seed capital 
bkf has historically met its cash and liquidity needs through cash generated by operating activities 
at december   bkf had cash and cash equivalents of million  compared to million at december  this decrease primarily reflects the timing of bonus payments  the purchases of fixed assets and the investment of seed capital in an alternative investment strategy  which were partly offset by the withdrawal of seed capital from affiliated investment partnerships  the collection of receivables and the annual withdrawal of general partner incentive allocations from affiliated investment partnerships 
the increase in investment advisory and incentive fees receivable from million at december  to million at december  primarily reflects the accrual of incentive fees  which was partly offset by the receipt in of incentive fees earned in the increase in investments in securities to million at december  from million at december   primarily reflects the seed capital investment in an offshore investment vehicle and the seeding of a small cap investment portfolio  which were partly offset by the return of capital relating to the liquidation of the van eck levin mid cap value fund during the second quarter  as bkf ceased the development of its mid cap value effort 
the decrease in investments in securities from consolidated affiliated partnerships from million at december  to million at december   and the decrease in due from broker from consolidated affiliated partnerships from million at december  to million at december  reflects i the liquidation in the first quarter of of two investment partnerships and ii the de consolidation of an affiliated partnership as of january   which was partly offset by the consolidation of an affiliated partnership that commenced operations in july the increase in prepaid expenses and other assets to million at december  from million at december  primarily reflects the prepayment of insurance policies and taxes 
the increase in investments in affiliated investment partnerships from million at december  to million at december  primarily reflects the de consolidation of an affiliated partnership and the realization of incentive allocations for the year ended december   which were partly offset by the withdrawal of general partner incentive allocations from the unconsolidated affiliated partnerships earned with respect to incentive allocations typically are withdrawn within three months following the end of the calendar year to pay compensation and other expenses 
investments in unaffiliated partnerships decreased to million at december  from million at december   reflecting the winding down of a consolidated multi manager  multi strategy partnership 
the proceeds from this withdrawal were invested in an offshore investment vehicle managed pursuant to a similar strategy which is reflected in the investments in securities 
the increase in deferred tax assets to million in from million in is primarily attributable to tax benefits related to the loss on the lease amendment 
accrued expenses were million at december   as compared to million at december  the largest component of such expenses is the accrual for third party marketing fees 
such fees are based on a percentage of accrued revenue  and such accruals may be reversed based on the subsequent investment performance of the relevant accounts through the end of the applicable performance measurement period

based upon bkf s current level of operations and anticipated growth  bkf expects that cash flows from operating activities will be sufficient to finance its working capital needs for the foreseeable future 
bkf s business is not seasonal 
except for the lease commitments and related expenditures described below  bkf has no material commitments for capital expenditures 
the company has office space obligations that require monthly payments plus escalations through september off balance sheet risk levco gp serves as the managing general partner for several affiliated investment partnerships which trade primarily in equity securities or  in the case of one partnership  in distressed corporate debt 
as of december   total partners capital in these partnerships was approximately million 
as of december   the sum total of levco gp s capital accounts in the affiliated investment partnerships was approximately million 
the financial condition and results of operations of certain of these affiliated investment partnerships are not included in bkf s consolidated statements of financial condition except to the extent of levco gp s equity ownership 
levco gp has not guaranteed any of the affiliated investment partnerships obligations  nor does it have any contractual commitments associated with them 
contractual obligations as of december   the company s contractual obligations  including payments due by period  are as follows in thousands payments due by period total thereafter operating leases      accrued lease loss amendment      total contractual obligations      critical accounting policies revenue recognition and related expenses with respect to incentive fees and allocations  bkf has elected to accrue income on a quarterly basis  though such fees and allocations are determined and billed or allocated at the end of the applicable measurement period 
such accruals  as well as related compensation and third party referral fees  may be reversed as the result of subsequent investment performance prior to the conclusion of the applicable contract year or investor withdrawal 
alternatively  bkf could have adopted a policy of not recognizing such fees or allocations until the respective payments are fixed at the end of the performance measurement period 
since most incentives fees or allocations are determined as of the end of the calendar year  the adoption of a revenue recognition policy that defers recognition of incentive fees or allocations and associated expenses could result in much lower levels of income  and associated compensation expenses  for periods prior to the fourth quarter 
bkf s annual financial results would not be materially affected  as most of the performance measurement periods conclude on december purchase price allocation in order to account for the acquisition of levco by bkf in utilizing the purchase method of accounting  levco s cost in excess of net assets was reflected in the following intangible items goodwill  employment contracts for key personnel and investment advisory contracts 
the total value of these intangibles at the time of the acquisition was million 
bkf determined that of that amount was attributable to goodwill  to the employment contracts and to the investment contracts 
bkf amortizes the value of the investment contracts over a ten year period  and amortized the employment contracts  which have all expired  over their respective terms 
pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  commencing in  the net carrying value of the goodwill of million at december   ceased to be amortized 
goodwill is subject to an annual impairment test 
investments in affiliated investment partnerships levco gp serves as the managing general partner for several affiliated investment partnerships which are not consolidated with bkf 
these general partnerships are periodically assessed to determine whether the underlying assets and liabilities should be consolidated

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk since bkf s revenues are largely driven by the market value of levco s assets under management  these revenues are exposed to fluctuations in the equity markets 
management fees for most accounts are determined based on the market value of the account on the last day of the quarter with respect to which the investment advisory fee is charged  so any significant increases or decreases in market value occurring on or shortly before the last day of a quarter may materially impact revenues for the quarter 
furthermore  since levco manages most of its assets in a large cap value style  a general decline in the performance of value stocks could have an adverse impact on levco s revenues 
similarly  a lack of opportunity to implement  or a failure to successfully implement  levco s event driven strategies  could reduce performance based incentive fees and allocations and thereby negatively impact bkf s revenues 
in addition  as of december  and  bkf had invested million and  respectively  in seed capital for long only equity products  which investments could be similarly impacted by a decline in the performance of value stocks  and million and million excluding accrued incentive allocations  respectively  in proprietary alternative investment strategies  which are also exposed to market fluctuations
