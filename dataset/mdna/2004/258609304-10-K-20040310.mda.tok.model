item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we provide technology and data products and services that direct marketers  web publishers and advertisers use to optimize their marketing programs and efficiently reach their customers 
we derive revenues from two business segments doubleclick techsolutions  which we refer to as our techsolutions segment and doubleclick data  which we refer to as our data segment 
during  through a series of transactions  we divested of our media businesses and as a result we no longer report a doubleclick media segment 
doubleclick techsolutions techsolutions includes our ad management products and services and our marketing automation products and services 
our ad management products and services consist of our dart for publishers service  dart enterprise  dart for advertisers service  motif and mediavisor 
our marketing automation products and services include our suite of email technology products consisting of the dartmail service and a licensed email software product  our campaign management software product and other related products and services and our web site measurement and analysis solution 
we generate our techsolutions revenue primarily from the delivery of advertising impressions and emails as well as the sale and the installation of our licensed software products 
doubleclick data data  which consists of our abacus and data management divisions  provides products and services to direct marketers 
abacus maintains the abacus alliance database in the united states  which is the largest proprietary database of consumer transactions used for target marketing purposes  and maintains alliances in the united kingdom  japan and through a joint venture  in germany 
in the united states  we also offer a buisiness to business alliance 
as a result of our acquisition of computer strategy coordinators  inc  a data management company  in june we began to offer direct marketers solutions for building and managing customer marketing databases and other related products and services as part of the new data management division 
we generate our data revenue primarily from the sale of consumer and business prospect lists  list processing  database development and database management services 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates  judgments and assumptions  which management believes to be reasonable  based on the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
variances in the estimates or assumptions used could yield materially different accounting results 
described below are the areas where we believe that the estimates  judgments or assumptions that we have made  if different  would have yielded the most significant differences in our financial statements 
restructuring estimates our restructuring reserves at december  consisted of million for our previous new york headquarters and approximately million for our other facilities  primarily louisville  colorado and london  england 
all remaining payments for our new york facility were made in january these payments were consistent with our restructuring accrual established for the new york location 
the restructuring accrual associated with the other facilities represents the excess of future lease commitments over estimated sublease income  if any 
these accruals were based on an analysis performed with the assistance of a real estate firm and are based on the current real estate market conditions in the local markets where these facilities are located 
the most material estimate is associated with our facility in london where the office space is currently sublet for only a portion of the remaining lease term 
the total remaining obligation for this facility is approximately million 
our london reserve is based on our estimate of future sublease income relative to the total remaining obligation and was determined based on the probability weights of various future sublease scenarios 
these scenarios resulted in a weighted average sublease rate where for each change in this assumption  additional restructuring charges or credits of approximately million would be required 
if market conditions or other circumstances change  this information may be updated and additional charges or credits may be required 
advertiser credits and bad debt we record reductions to revenue for the estimated future credits issuable to our customers in the event that delivered advertisements do not meet contractual specifications 
we follow this method because reasonably dependable estimates of such credits can be made based on historical experience 
if the actual amounts of customer credits differ from our estimates  revisions to the associated allowance may be required 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required in subsequent periods 
valuation of investments and goodwill we invest in companies  technologies and intangible assets in areas within our strategic focus  some of which have highly volatile fair values and uncertain profit potentials 
we evaluate our investments for impairment on a periodic basis and reduce the carrying values of such assets to their estimated fair value when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of strategic investments could indicate an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments  thereby possibly requiring impairment charges in the future 
when it is determined that the carrying value of investments may not be recoverable  management measures impairment based on projected discounted cash flows  recent transactions involving similar businesses and price revenue multiples at which they were bought and sold  price revenue multiples of competitors and the closing market price for investments that are publicly traded 
during the fourth quarter of  we performed our annual impairment test on our email reporting unit to determine if the goodwill associated with this reporting unit was impaired 
projected discounted cash flows were determined based on internal budgets  which were assembled during our strategic planning process 
our internal budgets are based on review of recent sales data for existing products  industry reports by business analysts  planned timing of new product launches and prior period bookings 
based on the results of the projected discounted cash flows as well as price revenue multiples of competitors  the fair value of our email reporting unit was determined to be in excess of the carrying value of such reporting unit  and  accordingly  no impairment charge was required 
if our forecasts and market multiples were significantly lower  impairment charges might have been required 
our forecasts for the email reporting unit were not significantly different than our actual results 
as of december   we held investments in equity instruments of public companies received as a result of certain business transactions  including shares held in doubleclick japan  adlink internet media ag and maxworldwide  inc such investments  which are in the internet industry  are subject to significant fluctuations in fair market value due to the volatility of the stock market 
the following sets forth the cost basis and fair market value of these investments  which are included in as investment in affiliates on the consolidated balance sheets 
as of december  fair market cost basis value in thousands doubleclick japan adlink internet media ag maxworldwide  inc some of these investments have suffered a decrease in value in the past as a result of market volatility 
we will continue to evaluate our investments in affiliates for impairment due to declines in market value considered to be other than temporary 
this evaluation includes  in addition to persistent  declining stock prices  general economic and company specific assessments 
in the event of a determination that a further decline in market value is other than temporary  a charge to earnings will be recorded for all or a portion of the unrealized loss and a new cost basis in the investment will be established 
deferred tax assets pursuant to sfas  we record a valuation allowance to the extent realization of our deferred tax assets is not more likely than not 
for the years ended december  and  we recorded a valuation allowance of approximately million and million respectively  against those net deferred tax assets that we believe  after considering all the available objective evidence  both positive and negative  historical and prospective  with greater weight given to historical evidence  are not more likely than not expected to be realized 
if we determine that we would be able to realize additional or all of our deferred tax assets  an adjustment to the net deferred tax asset would increase income and or adjust additional paid in capital and or goodwill in the period such determination was made 
property and equipment property and equipment is stated at cost and depreciated using the straight line method over the shorter of the estimated life of the asset or the lease term 
we periodically review the useful lives of our assets to confirm that such useful life determination is appropriate 
if we determine that the estimated useful life of our assets needs to be adjusted to reflect depreciation expense over the remaining time that the assets are expected to remain in service  future income or losses will be impacted in the subsequent periods after such a determination is made

goodwill and other impairments for the year ended december  we did not record any impairment charges for our goodwill or intangible assets 
goodwill and other impairments was million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  in based on the prolonged softness in the economy and the then current and operational performance of our email reporting unit  we initiated a third party valuation of our email reporting unit to determine whether the recorded balance of goodwill related to this reporting unit was recoverable 
the outcome of this valuation resulted in an impairment charge of approximately million being recorded during the year 
the fair market value of the email reporting unit was determined based on revenue projections  the then recent transactions involving similar businesses and the price revenue multiples at which they were bought and sold  and the price revenue multiples of our competitors in the email marketplace at that time 
in addition  we also determined that the fair values of certain intangibles assets were considered impaired 
we recorded an impairment charge of million based on the difference between the carrying value and estimated fair value of certain intangible assets associated with the email reporting unit 
in the persistence of unfavorable economic conditions led us to undertake a review of the recoverability of certain of our investments 
as a result of the then significantly lower than expected revenues generated to date and considerably reduced estimates of future performance  we concluded that our investments in plan and flashbase were impaired 
accordingly  we recognized an approximately million impairment charge equal to the difference between our investments in  and the estimated fair value of  these businesses in the third quarter of of this amount  approximately million related to plan and million related to flashbase 
the amount of the goodwill impairment was calculated based on discounted analyses of these entities expected future cash flows  which were no longer deemed adequate to support the value of the goodwill associated with these investments 
in both cases  sharply reduced estimates of anticipated revenue growth and operating results  triggered primarily by the continued softness in aggregate online advertising spending  generated correspondingly lowered expectations of future cash flows and formed the basis for the recording of the charge in the third quarter of these businesses expected future cash flows and terminal values were based on our budgeted forecasts and estimates 
in our calculation to determine the impairment charge for our investment in plan  we used a discount rate of and assumed a remaining useful life of years  which represented the remaining useful life of the goodwill associated with this investment

as a result  we recorded a charge of approximately million in the fourth quarter of restructuring credits charges  net during the year ended december   we recorded restructuring credits of approximately million  partially offset by restructuring charges of approximately million 
this resulted in a net restructuring credit of million 
this credit was due to the reversal of a portion of our real estate reserve relating to our previous new york headquarters and our san francisco facility
