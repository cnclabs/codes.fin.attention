critical accounting policies and estimates the accompanying management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventory reserves  impairments of investments in marketable securities and investments accounted for by the equity method  the recoverability of other long lived assets including goodwill and other intangible assets  pension and other post retirement benefit obligations and the underlying actuarial assumptions related thereto  the realization of deferred income tax assets and accruals for environmental remediation  litigation  income tax and other contingencies 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
actual results may differ from previously estimated amounts under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements o the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments and other factors 
the company takes into consideration the current financial condition of its customers  the age of the outstanding balance and the current economic environment when assessing the adequacy of the allowance 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
during  and  the net amount written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of the balance of the allowance for doubtful accounts as of the beginning of the year ranged from to 
o the company provides reserves for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventories equal to the difference between the cost of inventories and the estimated net realizable value using assumptions about future demand for its products and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventories reserves may be required 
nl provides reserves for tools and supplies inventory based generally on both historical and expected future usage requirements 
o the company owns investments in certain companies that are accounted for either as marketable securities carried at fair value or accounted for under the equity method 
for all of such investments  the company records an impairment charge when it believes an investment has experienced a decline in fair value below its cost basis for marketable securities or below its carrying value for equity method investees that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
at december   the carrying value which equals their fair value of all of the company s marketable securities exceeded the cost basis of each of such investments 
with respect to the company s investment in the amalgamated sugar company llc  which represents approximately of the aggregate carrying value of all of the company s marketable securities at december   the million carrying value of such investment exceeded its million cost basis by about 
at december   the per share quoted market price of the company s investment in timet the only one of the company s equity method investees for which quoted market prices are available exceeded its per share net carrying value by about 
o the company recognizes an impairment charge associated with its long lived assets  including property and equipment  goodwill and other intangible assets  whenever it determines that recovery of such long lived asset is not probable 
such determination is made in accordance with the applicable gaap requirements associated with the long lived asset  and is based upon  among other things  estimates of the amount of future net cash flows to be generated by the long lived asset and estimates of the current fair value of the asset 
adverse changes in such estimates of future net cash flows or estimates of fair value could result in an inability to recover the carrying value of the long lived asset  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge to be recognized in the future 
under applicable gaap sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  property and equipment is not assessed for impairment unless certain impairment indicators  as defined  are present 
during  impairment indicators were present only with respect to the property and equipment associated with i the company s waste management operating segment  which represented approximately of the company s consolidated net property and equipment as of december   and ii compx s european operations  which represented approximately of the company s consolidated net property and equipment as of december  waste control specialists completed an impairment review of its net property and equipment and related net assets as of december   and compx completed an impairment review of the net property and equipment and related net assets associated with its european operations as of september  such analyses indicated no impairments were present as the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with such operations exceeded the carrying value of such operation s net assets 
significant judgment is required in estimating such undiscounted cash flows 
such estimated cash flows are inherently uncertain  and there can be no assurance that the future cash flows reflected in these projections will be achieved 
under applicable gaap sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is required to be reviewed for impairment at least on an annual basis 
goodwill will also be reviewed for impairment at other times during each year when impairment indicators  as defined  are present 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company has assigned its goodwill to four reporting units as that term is defined in sfas no 

goodwill attributable to the chemicals operating segment was assigned to the reporting unit consisting of nl in total 
goodwill attributable to the components products operating segment was assigned to three reporting units within that operating segment  one consisting of compx s security products operations  one consisting of compx s european operations and one consisting of compx s canadian and taiwanese operations 
no goodwill impairments were deemed to exist as a result of the company s annual impairment review completed during the third quarter of  as the estimated fair value of each such reporting unit exceeded the net carrying value of the respective reporting unit nl reporting unit  compx security products reporting unit  compx european operations reporting unit and compx canadian and taiwanese operations reporting unit 
the estimated fair values of the three compx reporting units are determined based on discounted cash flow projections  and the estimated fair value of the nl reporting unit is based upon the quoted market price for nl s common stock  as appropriately adjusted for a control premium 
significant judgment is required in estimating the discounted cash flows for the compx reporting units 
such estimated cash flows are inherently uncertain  and there can be no assurance that compx will achieve the future cash flows reflected in its projections 
in addition to its internal cash flow projections  compx used a third party valuation specialist in reviewing the net assets of its european operations  including goodwill and net property and equipment  for impairment 
o the company maintains various defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefits other than pensions opeb 
the amounts recognized as defined benefit pension and opeb expenses  and the reported amounts of prepaid and accrued pension costs and accrued opeb costs  are actuarially determined based on several assumptions  including discount rates  expected rates of returns on plan assets and expected health care trend rates 
variances from these actuarially assumed rates will result in increases or decreases  as applicable  in the recognized pension and opeb obligations  pension and opeb expenses and funding requirements 
these assumptions are more fully described below under assumptions on defined benefit pension plans and opeb plans 
o the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred income tax assets to the amount that is believed to be realized under the more likely than not recognition criteria 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  it is possible that in the future the company may change its estimate of the amount of the deferred income tax assets that would more likely than not be realized in the future  resulting in an adjustment to the deferred income tax asset valuation allowance that would either increase or decrease  as applicable  reported net income in the period such change in estimate was made 
o the company records accruals for environmental  legal  income tax and other contingencies and commitments when estimated future expenditures associated with such contingencies become probable  and the amounts can be reasonably estimated 
however  new information may become available  or circumstances such as applicable laws and regulations may change  thereby resulting in an increase or decrease in the amount required to be accrued for such matters and therefore a decrease or increase in reported net income in the period of such change 
operating income for each of the company s three operating segments are impacted by certain of these significant judgments and estimates  as summarized below o chemicals allowance for doubtful accounts  reserves for obsolete or unmarketable inventories  impairment of equity method investees  goodwill and other long lived assets  defined benefit pension and opeb plans and loss accruals 
o component products allowance for doubtful accounts  reserves for obsolete or unmarketable inventories  impairment of long lived assets and loss accruals 
o waste management allowance for doubtful accounts  impairment of long lived assets and loss accruals 
in addition  general corporate and other items are impacted by the significant judgments and estimates for impairment of marketable securities and equity method investees  defined benefit pension and opeb plans  deferred income tax asset valuation allowances and loss accruals 
chemicals kronos relative changes in kronos tio sales and operating income during the past three years are primarily due to i relative changes in tio sales and production volumes  ii relative changes in tio average selling prices  iii relative changes in foreign currency exchange rates and iv ceasing to periodically amortize goodwill beginning in the relatively lower levels of sales and production volumes in as compared to and are due in part to the effects of a fire at one of kronos production facilities  as discussed below 
selling prices for tio  kronos principal product  were generally decreasing during all of and the first quarter of  were generally flat during the second quarter of  were generally increasing during the last half of and the first quarter of  were generally flat during the second quarter of and were generally decreasing during the third and fourth quarters of chemicals operating income  as presented below  is stated net of amortization of valhi s purchase accounting adjustments made in conjunction with its acquisitions of its interest in nl and kronos 
such adjustments result in additional depreciation and amortization expense beyond amounts separately reported by kronos 
such additional non cash expenses reduced chemicals operating income  as reported by valhi  by million  million and million in  and  respectively  as compared to amounts separately reported by kronos 
during  about million of such purchase accounting adjustment amortization relates to goodwill 
as discussed above  the decline in the aggregate amount of purchase accounting adjustment amortization from to is primarily due to ceasing the periodic amortization of goodwill beginning in other changes in the aggregate amount of purchase accounting adjustment amortization during the past three years is due primarily to relative changes in foreign currency exchange rates

when translated from billing currencies to us dollars using actual foreign currency exchange rates prevailing during the respective periods  kronos average tio selling prices in increased compared to kronos sales are denominated in various currencies  including the us dollar  the euro  other major european currencies and the canadian dollar 
the disclosure of the percentage change in kronos average tio selling prices in billing currencies which excludes the effects of fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies is considered a non gaap financial measure under regulations of the sec 
the disclosure of the percentage change in kronos average tio selling prices using actual foreign currency exchange rates prevailing during the respective periods is considered the most directly comparable financial measure presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap measure 
kronos discloses percentage changes in its average tio prices in billing currencies because kronos believes such disclosure provides useful information to investors to allow them to analyze such changes without the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  thereby facilitating period to period comparisons of the relative changes in average selling prices in the actual various billing currencies 
generally  when the us dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies  the percentage change in average selling prices in billing currencies will be higher or lower  respectively  than such percentage changes would be using actual exchange rates prevailing during the respective periods 
the difference between the change in kronos average tio selling prices during as compared to using actual foreign currency exchange rates prevailing during the respective period the gaap measure and the percentage change in kronos average tio selling prices in billing currencies the non gaap measure during such periods is due to the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates

kronos record tio sales volumes in increased from the previous record volumes of  with higher volumes in european and north american markets more than offsetting lower volumes in export markets 
by volume  approximately one half of nl s tio sales volumes were attributable to markets in europe  with attributable to north america and the balance to export markets 
kronos tio production volumes in  also a new record for kronos  were higher than  with operating rates at near full capacity in both years 
chemicals sales increased million in compared to due primarily to higher tio sales volumes  offset by lower average tio selling prices 
kronos tio sales volumes in were a new record for kronos and were higher compared to primarily due to higher volumes in european and north american markets 
the lower tio sales volumes in were due in part to the effects of the previously reported fire at kronos leverkusen  germany facility in march chemicals operating income declined in compared to as the effect of lower average ti selling prices more than offset the effect of higher ti sales and production volumes 
excluding the effect of fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies  kronos average tio selling prices in were lower than  with prices lower in all major regions 
including the effect of fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies  kronos average tio selling prices in billing currencies in decreased compared to kronos tio production volumes in were a new record for kronos and were higher than nl s operating rates in were lower as compared to primarily due to lost production resulting from the leverkusen fire 
chemicals operating income in includes million of business interruption insurance proceeds as payment for losses unallocated period costs and lost margin caused by the leverkusen fire 
the effects of the lower tio sales and production volumes were offset in part by the business interruption insurance proceeds 
of such million of business interruption insurance proceeds  million was recorded as a reduction of cost of sales to offset unallocated period costs that resulted from lost production  and the remaining million  representing recovery of lost margin  was recorded in other income 
the business interruption insurance proceeds distorts the chemicals operating income margin percentage in as there are no sales associated with the million of lost margin operating profit recognized 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
kronos also recognized insurance recoveries of million in for property damage and related cleanup and other extra expenses related to the fire  resulting in an insurance gain of million  as the insurance recoveries exceeded the carrying value of the property destroyed and the cleanup and other extra expenses incurred 
such insurance gain is not reported as a component of chemicals operating income but is included in general corporate items 
kronos does not expect to recognize any additional insurance recoveries related to the leverkusen fire 
kronos efforts to debottleneck its production facilities to meet long term demand continue to prove successful 
kronos expects its tio production capacity will increase by about  metric tons primarily at its chloride process facilities  with moderate capital expenditures  to increase its aggregate production capacity to about  metric tons by kronos has substantial operations and assets located outside the united states primarily in germany  belgium  norway and canada 
a significant amount of kronos sales generated from its non us operations are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  principally the euro  other major european currencies and the canadian dollar 
a portion of kronos sales generated from its non us operations are denominated in the non us dollar 
certain raw materials  primarily titanium containing feedstocks  are purchased in us dollars  while labor and other production costs are denominated primarily in local currencies 
consequently  the translated us dollar value of kronos foreign sales and operating results are subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations which may favorably or adversely impact reported earnings and may affect the comparability of period to period operating results 
overall  fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies  primarily the euro  increased tio sales in by a net million compared to  and increased tio sales in by a net million compared to fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies similarly impacted kronos foreign currency denominated operating expenses 
kronos operating costs that are not denominated in the us dollar  when translated into us dollars  were higher in compared to the same periods of overall  currency exchange rate fluctuations resulted in a net decrease in kronos operating income in of approximately million as compared to overall  the net impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations on kronos operating income comparisons was not significant in as compared to kronos expects its tio production volumes in will approximate its production volumes  and sales volumes are expected to be slightly higher in as compared to kronos average tio selling prices  which declined during the second half of  are expected to continue to decline during the first quarter of kronos is hopeful that its average tio selling prices will cease to decline sometime during the first half of  and will rise thereafter 
nevertheless  kronos expects its average tio selling prices  in billing currencies  will be lower in as compared to overall  kronos expects it chemicals operating income in will be lower than kronos expectations as to the future prospects of kronos and the tio industry are based upon a number of factors beyond nl s control  including worldwide growth of gross domestic product  competition in the marketplace  unexpected or earlier than expected capacity additions and technological advances 
if actual developments differ from kronos expectations  kronos results of operations could be unfavorably affected 
component products compx years ended december  change in millions net sales operating income operating income margin component products sales were higher in as compared to due primarily to the favorable effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies  as discussed below  increased net sales by million in as compared to in addition to the favorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  component products sales increased in as compared to due to the net effects of higher sales volumes of security products  lower sales volumes of ergonomic products  higher sales volumes of slide products in north american markets and lower sales volumes of slide products in the european market 
during  sales of slide and security products increased and  respectively  as compared to  while sales of ergonomic products decreased 
the percentage changes in both slide and ergonomic products include the impact resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
sales of security products are generally denominated in us dollars 
despite the increase in sales in  operating income declined due primarily to unfavorable effects of changes in product mix  increases in certain raw material costs primarily steel and expenses associated with the consolidation of compx s two canadian facilities into one facility  as well as the unfavorable effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates discussed below 
expenses of  associated with compx s canadian plant consolidation  which commenced in the first quarter of  were incurred substantially all in the first half of the year 
benefits associated with this consolidation began to be realized in the fourth quarter of fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies  as discussed below  decreased operating income by million in as compared to in addition  component products operating income in the includes a million restructuring charge associated with the implimentation of certain headcount reductions in compx s netherlands operations  while component products operating income in includes charges aggregating million related to the re tooling of one of compx s manufacturing facilities and provisions for changes in estimate with respect to obsolete and slow moving inventories  overhead absorption rates and other items 
component products sales and operating income decreased in compared to due to continued weak demand for compx s component products sold to the office furniture market resulting from the continued weak economic conditions in the manufacturing sectors in north america and europe 
sales of slide and ergonomic products decreased and  respectively  in compared to  and sales of security products decreased 
component products operating income comparisons were impacted by i charges aggregating million in related to the consolidation and rationalization of certain of compx s european and north american operations including headcount reductions and provisions for obsolete and slow moving inventories and other items and ii charges aggregating million in discussed above 
the cost savings resulting from this retooling began to be reflected in compx s operating results in the first quarter of operating income comparisons were also negatively impacted by increases in certain raw material costs  primarily steel  as well as a decline in volume levels  unfavorable changes in the sales mix and general competitive pricing pressures 
operating income comparisons were favorably impacted by ceasing to periodically amortize goodwill  which amounted to approximately million in none in  as well as the impact of certain cost reductions that were implemented 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
compx has substantial operations and assets located outside the united states in canada  the netherlands and taiwan 
a portion of compx s sales generated from its non us operations are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  principally the canadian dollar  the euro and the new taiwan dollar 
in addition  a portion of compx s sales generated from its non us operations are denominated in the us dollar 
most raw materials  labor and other production costs for such non us operations are denominated primarily in local currencies 
consequently  the translated us dollar values of compx s foreign sales and operating results are subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations which may favorably or unfavorably impact reported earnings and may affect comparability of period to period operating results 
during  currency exchange rate fluctuations of the canadian dollar and the euro positively impacted component products sales comparisons with principally with respect to slide products  but currency exchange rate fluctuations of the canadian dollar negatively impacted component products operating income comparisons for the same period 
during  the effects of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates did not materially impact component products sales or operating income as compared to compx expects that weak market conditions will continue in the office furniture market  the primary end market for compx s products  during while the business and institutional furniture manufacturer s association bifma international has predicted a growth in furniture shipments for  the total volume of shipments is expected to be below the highest annual volume set in if the prediction is correct  would be the first year of office furniture industry growth since however  competitive pricing pressures are expected to continue to be a challenge as foreign manufacturing  particularly in china  gain market share 
compx expects steel prices to continue to rise in as much as to  or more 
compx has initiated price increases on certain of its products and will continue to focus on cost improvement initiatives  utilizing lean manufacturing techniques and prudent balance sheet management in order to minimize the impact of lower sales to the office furniture industry and to develop value added customer relationships with additional focus on sales of compx x higher margin ergonomic computer support systems to improve operating results 
compx currently expects to realize annual cost savings of million to million as the result of the headcount reduction implemented during in its netherlands operations 
however  compx continues with its ongoing strategic analysis of the operations  and additional actions could be taken in the future that could result in charges for asset impairment  including goodwill  and other costs in future periods 
these actions  along with other activities to eliminate excess capacity  are designed to position compx to more effectively concentrate on both new product and new customer opportunities to improve its profitability 
waste management waste control specialists years ended december  in millions net sales operating loss waste management sales decreased  and the operating loss increased  in the compared to due to continued weak demand for waste management services as well as costs incurred in related to certain licensing and permitting activities 
waste control specialists continued emphasis on cost control helped to mitigate the effect of lower sales 
waste control specialists also continues to explore opportunities to obtain certain types of new business that  if obtained  could increase its sales  and decrease its operating loss  in as compared to waste management sales decreased in compared to due primarily to the effect of weak demand for waste control specialists waste management services 
waste management s operating losses declined during compared to as the effect of certain cost controls implemented in more than offset the effects of the decline in sales 
waste control specialists currently has permits which allow it to treat  store and dispose of a broad range of hazardous and toxic wastes  and to treat and store a broad range of low level and mixed level radioactive wastes 
the waste management industry currently is experiencing a relative decline in the number of environmental remediation projects generating wastes 
in addition  efforts on the part of generators to reduce the volume of waste and or manage wastes onsite at their facilities also has resulted in weak demand for waste control specialists waste management services 
these factors have led to reduced demand and increased downward price pressure for waste management services 
while waste control specialists believes its broad range of authorizations for the treatment and storage of low level and mixed level radioactive waste streams provides certain competitive advantages  a key element of waste control specialists long term strategy to provide one stop shopping for hazardous  low level and mixed level radioactive wastes includes obtaining additional regulatory authorizations for the disposal of low level and mixed level radioactive wastes 
prior to june  the state law in texas where waste control specialists disposal facility is located prohibited the applicable texas regulatory agency from issuing a license for the disposal of a broad range of low level and mixed level radioactive waste to a private enterprise operating a disposal facility in texas 
in june  a new texas state law was enacted that allows the regulatory agency to issue a low level radioactive waste disposal license to a private entity  such as waste control specialists 
waste control specialists currently expects to apply for such a disposal license with the applicable regulatory agency by the application deadline of august  the length of time that the regulatory agency will take to review and act upon the license application is uncertain  although waste control specialists does not currently expect the agency would issue any final decision on the license application before there can be no assurance that waste control specialists will be successful in obtaining any such license 
waste control specialists is continuing its efforts to increase its sales volumes from waste streams that conform to authorizations it currently has in place 
waste control specialists is also continuing to identify certain waste streams  and attempting to obtain modifications to its current permits  that would allow for treatment  storage and disposal of additional types of wastes 
the ability of waste control specialists to achieve increased sales volumes of these waste streams  together with improved operating efficiencies through further cost reductions and increased capacity utilization  are important factors in waste control specialists ability to achieve improved cash flows 
the company currently believes waste control specialists can become a viable  profitable operation  even if waste control specialists is unsuccessful in obtaining a license for the disposal of a broad range of low level and mixed level radioactive wastes 
however  there can be no assurance that waste control specialists efforts will prove successful in improving its cash flows 
valhi has in the past  and may in the future  consider strategic alternatives with respect to waste control specialists 
there can be no assurance that the company would not report a loss with respect to any such strategic transaction

loss before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle equity in earnings losses of timet tremont accounts for its interest in timet by the equity method 
tremont s equity in earnings of timet differs from the amounts that would be expected by applying tremont s ownership percentage to timet s separately reported earnings because of the effect of amortization of purchase accounting adjustments made by tremont in conjunction with tremont s acquisitions of its interests in timet 
amortization of such basis differences generally increases earnings or reduces losses attributable to timet as reported by the company  and aggregated million in  million in and million in exclusive of the provision for an other than temporary impairment of the company s investment in timet discussed below 
in february  timet completed a reverse stock split of its common stock at a ratio of one share of post split common stock for each outstanding ten shares of pre split common stock 
the per share disclosures related to timet discussed herein have been adjusted to give effect to the reverse stock split 
implementing such reverse split had no financial statement impact to the company  and the company s ownership interest in timet did not change as a result thereof 
tremont periodically evaluates the net carrying value of its long term assets  including its investment in timet  to determine if there has been any decline in value below its amortized cost basis that is other than temporary and would  therefore  require a write down which would be accounted for as a realized loss 
at september   after considering what it believes to be all relevant factors  including  among other things  timet s then recent nyse stock prices  and timet s operating results  financial position  estimated asset values and prospects  tremont recorded a million impairment provision for an other than temporary decline in value of its investment in timet 
such impairment provision is reported as part of the company s equity in losses of timet in at december   tremont s net carrying value of its investment in timet was per share compared to a nyse market price at that date of per share 
in determining the amount of the impairment charge  tremont considered  among other things  then recent ranges of timet s nyse market price and current estimates of timet s future operating losses that would further reduce tremont s carrying value of its investment in timet as it records additional equity in losses of timet 
tremont will continue to monitor and evaluate the value of its investment in timet 
while the accounting rules may require an investment in a security accounted for by the equity method to be written down if the market value of that security declines  they do not permit a writeup if the market value subsequently recovers 
timet reported higher sales in as compared to  and timet improved from a million operating loss in to operating income of million in timet s net sales increased in due in part to a increase in sales volumes of melted products ingot and slab  changes in product mix and a weakening of the us dollar as compared to the british pound sterling and the euro 
these factors were partially offset by a decrease in average selling prices for melted products 
the improvement in melted product sales volumes  and the decrease in melted products selling prices  are due principally to new customer relationships and a change in product mix

the cyclical nature of the aerospace industry has been the principal driver of the historical fluctuations in the performance of most titanium companies 
over the past years  the titanium industry had cyclical peaks in mill product shipments in  and and cyclical lows in  and demand for titanium reached its highest level in when industry mill product shipments reached approximately  metric tons 
however  since that peak  industry mill product shipments have fluctuated significantly  primarily due to a continued change in demand for titanium from the commercial aerospace sector 
in  industry shipments approximated  metric tons  and in timet estimates industry shipments approximated  metric tons 
timet currently expects total industry mill product shipments in will increase from levels to at least  metric tons 
although the commercial airline industry continues to face significant challenges  recent economic data have sign of an improving business environment in that sector 
according to the airline monitor  the worldwide commercial airline industry reported an estimated operating loss of approximately billion in  compared to a billion loss in and an billion loss in the airline monitor is currently forecasting operating income of approximately billion for the industry in furthermore  global airline passenger traffic returned to pre september  levels in november of although these appear to be positive signs  timet currently believes that industry mill product shipments into the commercial aerospace sector will be somewhat flat in and show a modest upturn in the airline monitor traditionally issues forecasts for commercial aircraft deliveries each january and july 
according to the airline monitor  large commercial aircraft deliveries totaled including wide bodies in the airline monitor s most recently issued forecast january calls for deliveries in  deliveries in and deliveries in relative to  these forecasted delivery rates represent anticipated declines of about in  in and in from through  the airline monitor calls for a continued increase each year in large commercial aircraft deliveries with forecasted deliveries of aircraft in  exceeding levels 
deliveries of titanium generally precede aircraft deliveries by about one year  although this varies considerably by titanium product 
this correlates to timet s cycle  which historically precedes the cycle of the aircraft industry and related deliveries 
although the current business environment continues to make it difficult to predict future performance  timet currently expects sales revenue in to increase to between million and million  reflecting the combined effects of increases in sales volumes and market share and relative weakness of the us dollar as compared to the british pound sterling and the euro  partially offset by customer and product mix 
mill product sales volumes  which were  metric tons in  are expected to increase to between  and  metric tons in melted product sales volumes  which were  metric tons in  is expected to decrease to between  and  metric tons in timet currently expects between and of its mill and melted product sales volumes will be derived from the commercial aerospace sector which would be a slight decrease from  with the balance from military aerospace  industrial and emerging markets 
the expected increase in sales volumes in are principally driven by an anticipated increase in sales volume to industrial and emerging markets 
additionally  timet s backlog of unfilled orders was approximately million at december   compared to million at december  and million at december  substantially the entire year end backlog is scheduled for shipment during timet s order backlog may not be a reliable indicator of future business activity 
raw material costs represent the largest portion of timet s manufacturing cost structure 
timet has recently been experiencing higher raw material prices due to a tightening in raw material availability  especially in the scrap markets 
timet also expects an increase in energy costs in timet expects to manufacture a significant portion of its titanium sponge requirements in the unit cost of titanium sponge manufactured at timet s nevada facility is expected to decrease relative to  due primarily to higher sponge plant operating rates as the plant moves to full capacity by the third quarter of timet expects the aggregate cost of purchased sponge and scrap to increase during timet currently expects production volumes will increase in  increasing overall capacity utilization to between and in as compared to in 
however  practical capacity utilization measures can vary significantly based on product mix 
timet continues to identify areas for potential cost savings  in addition to the savings realized in  and expects gross margin in to range from to of net sales 
timet currently anticipates that it will receive orders from boeing for about million pounds of product during at this projected order level  timet expects to recognize about million of operating income in under the boeing lta s take or pay provisions 
overall  timet currently expects it will report operating income for of between million and million  including the million of boeing take or pay income and income of million in the first quarter related to a change in the vacation policy for its us salaried employees 
timet currently expects its net earnings in will range from a net loss of million to net income of million  including the million of boeing take or pay income and the million benefit related to the change in the vacation policy 
during  timet adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under the transition provisions of sfas no 
 timet determined that the entire carrying value of its recognized goodwill at december  was impaired  and during timet recognized a million net charge recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle to writeoff all of its recognized goodwill 
however  tremont had already written off all of its pro rata share of timet s recognized goodwill as part of a provision for an other than temporary impairment of its investment in timet at that time 
accordingly  timet s adoption of sfas no 
had no financial statement impact to the company during general corporate and other items general corporate interest and dividend income 
general corporate interest and dividend income decreased million in as compared to due to a lower average level of invested funds and lower average yields 
general corporate interest and dividend income decreased million in compared to due to a lower average level of invested funds and lower average yields 
the company received million of distributions from the amalgamated sugar company llc in compared to million in each of and see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
aggregate general corporate interest and dividend income is currently expected to be lower during compared to due primarily to a lower amount of funds available for investment 
legal settlement gains 
the  of net legal settlement gains in and the million of net legal settlement gains in relate to nl s settlements with certain former insurance carriers 
the million net legal settlement gains in relate principally to i settlement of certain litigation to which waste control specialists was a party million and ii nl s additional settlements with certain former insurance carriers million 
nl s legal settlement gains in  and  as well as similar legal settlement gains in  resolved court proceedings in which nl had sought reimbursement from the carriers for legal defense costs and indemnity coverage for certain of its environmental remediation expenditures 
no further material settlements relating to litigation concerning environmental remediation coverages are expected

securities transaction gains in relate principally to a first quarter gain of  related to nl s receipt of shares of valhi common stock in exchange for shares of tremont common stock held directly or indirectly by nl such gain being attributable to nl stockholders other than the company 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
securities transaction gains in are comprised of i a million unrealized gain related to the reclassification of  shares of halliburton company common stock from available for sale to trading securities and ii a million gain related to changes in the market value of the halliburton common stock classified as trading securities

insurance gain 
the insurance gain in relates to proceeds nl received related to property damage insurance coverages for the fire at its leverkusen  germany facility  as the proceeds received exceeded the carrying value of the property destroyed and cleanup and other extra costs incurred 
nl does not expect to receive any additional insurance proceeds related to the leverkusen fire 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
other general corporate income items 
the gain on disposal of property and equipment in relates primarily to the sale of certain real property of nl not associated with nl s tio operations 
nl has certain other real property  including some subject to environmental remediation  which could be sold in the future for a profit 
the million foreign currency transaction gain in relates to the extinguishment of certain intercompany indebtedness of nl 
the gain on disposal of fixed assets in relates to the sale of certain real estate held by tremont 
the gain on sale leaseback in relates to compx s manufacturing facility in the netherlands 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
general corporate expenses 
net general corporate expenses in were million higher than due primarily to higher environmental remediation expenses of nl principally related to one formerly owned site of nl for which the remediation process is expected to occur over the next several years 
such environmental expenses are included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
in addition  nl s million of proceeds from the disposal of its specialty chemicals business unit in january related to its agreement not to compete in the rheological products business was recognized as a component of general corporate income expense ratably over the five year non compete period ended in january million recognized in and  recognized in 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
net general corporate expenses in calendar are currently expected to be lower than calendar due to lower expected environmental remediation expenses of nl 
however  obligations for environmental remediation obligations are difficult to assess and estimate  and no assurance can be given that actual costs will not exceed accrued amounts or that costs will not be incurred with respect to sites for which no estimate of liability can presently be made 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
net general corporate expenses in were million higher than in  as higher legal and stock compensation related expenses of nl were only partially offset by the effect of lower compensation related expenses of tremont 
interest expense 
interest expense declined million in as compared to due primarily to the net effects of lower average levels of indebtedness of valhi parent  higher average levels of indebtedness of kronos and lower average interest rates on kronos indebtedness 
assuming interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates do not increase significantly from current levels  interest expense in is expected to approximate interest expense in interest expense declined million in compared to due primarily to lower average levels of outstanding indebtedness as well as lower average us variable interest rates 
interest expense in includes million related to the loss on early extinguishment of certain indebtedness of nl 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
at december   approximately million of consolidated indebtedness  principally kii s publicly traded debt and valhi s loans from snake river sugar company  bears interest at fixed interest rates averaging million with a weighted average interest rate of  million with a weighted average fixed interest rate of 
fixed rate outstanding indebtedness at december  consisted primarily of valhi s lyons and nl s senior secured notes  both of which were fully retired by december   as well as valhi s loans from snake river 
the weighted average interest rate on million of outstanding variable rate borrowings at december  was  
the weighted average interest rate on outstanding variable rate debt declined from december  to december  due primarily to lower average interest rates on us borrowings  as well as lower outstanding borrowings under kii s european revolver at december  as compared to december  for which the average interest rate is generally higher than us borrowings 
the weighted average interest rate on outstanding variable rate borrowings declined slightly from december  to december  as the effect of lower average interest rates on us borrowings more than offset the effect of higher average interest rates on nl s non us borrowings 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
kii has a certain amount of indebtedness denominated in currencies other than the us dollar and  accordingly  kronos interest expense is also subject to currency fluctuations 
see item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
periodic cash interest payments were not required on valhi s deferred coupon lyons which were fully retired by december  
as a result  cash interest expense payments in the past had been lower than accrual basis interest expense 
provision for income taxes 
the principal reasons for the difference between the company s effective income tax rates and the us federal statutory income tax rates are explained in note to the consolidated financial statements 
income tax rates vary by jurisdiction country and or state  and relative changes in the geographic mix of the company s pre tax earnings can result in fluctuations in the effective income tax rate 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  effective january   the company no longer recognizes periodic amortization of goodwill 
under gaap  generally there is no income tax benefit recognized for financial reporting purposes attributable to goodwill amortization 
accordingly  ceasing to periodically amortize goodwill beginning in impacted the company s overall effective income tax rate in and as compared to during  nl and kronos reduced their deferred income tax asset valuation allowance by an aggregate of approximately million  primarily as a result of utilization of certain income tax attributes for which the benefit had not previously been recognized 
in addition  kronos recognized a million income tax benefit related to the net refund of certain prior year german income taxes 
during  nl and kronos reduced their deferred income tax asset valuation allowance by an aggregate of approximately million  primarily as a result of utilization of certain income tax attributes for which the benefit had not previously been recognized 
during  tremont increased its deferred income tax asset valuation allowance at the valhi consolidated level by a net million primarily because tremont concluded certain tax attributes do not currently meet the more likely than not recognition criteria 
the provision for income taxes in also includes a million deferred income tax benefit related to certain changes in the belgian tax law 
during  nl and kronos reduced their deferred income tax asset valuation allowance by an aggregate of million 
of such reduction  million related to a change in estimate of kronos ability to utilize certain german income tax attributes following the completion of a restructuring of its german operations  the benefit of which had not previously been recognized under the more likely than not recognition criteria 
in addition  kronos also utilized certain tax attributes during for which the benefit had also not previously been recognized 
during  tremont increased its deferred income tax asset valuation allowance at the valhi consolidated level by a net million due primarily because tremont concluded certain tax attributes  including its net operating loss carryforwards generated prior to january  no longer met the more likely than not recognition criteria 
such net operating loss carryforwards can only be used to offset future taxable income of tremont  and may not be used to offset future taxable income of other members of the contran tax group 
at december   kronos had the equivalent of approximately million of income tax loss carryforwards in germany with no expiration date 
however  kronos has provided a deferred income tax asset valuation allowance against substantially all of these tax loss carryforwards because kronos currently believes they do not meet the more likely than not recognition criteria 
kronos periodically evaluates the more likely than not recognition criteria with respect to such tax loss carryforwards  and it is possible that in the future kronos may conclude such carryforwards do meet the recognition criteria  at which time kronos would reverse all or a portion of such deferred tax valuation allowance 
in january  the german federal government enacted new tax law amendments that limit the annual utilization of income tax loss carryforwards effective january  the new law may significantly affect kronos future income tax expense and cash tax payments 
minority interest 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
minority interest in nl s subsidiaries relates principally to nl s majority owned environmental management subsidiary  nl environmental management services  inc ems 
ems was established in  at which time ems contractually assumed certain of nl s environmental liabilities 
ems earnings are based  in part  upon its ability to favorably resolve these liabilities on an aggregate basis 
the shareholders of ems  other than nl  actively manage the environmental liabilities and share in of ems cumulative earnings 
nl continues to consolidate ems and provides accruals for the reasonably estimable costs for the settlement of ems environmental liabilities  as discussed below 
as previously reported  waste control specialists was formed by valhi and another entity in waste control specialists assumed certain liabilities of the other owner and such liabilities exceeded the carrying value of the assets contributed by the other owner 
since its inception in  waste control specialists has reported aggregate net losses 
consequently  all of waste control specialists aggregate  inception to date net losses have accrued to the company for financial reporting purposes  and all of waste control specialists future net income or net losses will also accrue to the company until waste control specialists reports positive equity attributable to the other owner 
accordingly  no minority interest in waste control specialists net assets or net earnings losses is reported during  or  or as of december  and following completion of the merger transactions in which tremont became wholly owned by valhi in february  the company no longer reports minority interest in tremont s net assets or earnings 
the company commenced recognizing minority interest in kronos net assets and earnings in december following nl s distribution of a portion of the shares of kronos common stock to its shareholders

assumptions on defined benefit pension plans and opeb plans 
defined benefit pension plans 
the company maintains various defined benefit pension plans in the us  europe and canada 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
at december   approximately of the projected benefit obligations related to defined benefit pension plans relates to kronos and nl plans and relates to benefits owed to certain former us employees of medite corporation  a former business unit of valhi the medite plan 
the company accounts for its defined benefit pension plans using sfas no 
 employer s accounting for pensions 
under sfas no 
 defined benefit pension plan expense and prepaid and accrued pension costs are each recognized based on certain actuarial assumptions  principally the assumed discount rate  the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets and the assumed increase in future compensation levels 
the company recognized consolidated defined benefit pension plan expense of million in  million in and million in the amount of funding requirements for these defined benefit pension plans is generally based upon applicable regulation such as erisa in the us  and will generally differ from pension expense recognized under sfas no 
for financial reporting purposes 
contributions made by kronos and nl to all of their plans aggregated million in  million in and million in contributions with respect to the medite plan during the past three years were not significant 
the discount rates the company utilizes for determining defined benefit pension expense and the related pension obligations are based on current interest rates earned on long term bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by recognized rating agencies in the applicable country where the defined benefit pension benefits are being paid 
in addition  the company receives advice about appropriate discount rates from the company s third party actuaries  who may in some cases utilize their own market indices 
the discount rates are adjusted as of each valuation date september th for the kronos and nl plans and december st for the medite plan to reflect then current interest rates on such long term bonds 
such discount rates are used to determine the actuarial present value of the pension obligations as of december st of that year  and such discount rates are also used to determine the interest component of defined benefit pension expense for the following year 
at december   approximately of the projected benefit obligations for all of the company s defined benefit pension plans related to plans sponsored by nl and kronos  and substantially all of the remainder related to the medite plan 
of the amount attributable to plans sponsored by nl and kronos  approximately   and related to kronos plans in the us  germany  canada and norway  respectively 
the company uses several different discount rate assumptions in determining its consolidated defined benefit pension plan obligations and expense because the company maintains defined benefit pension plans in several different countries in north america and europe and the interest rate environment differs from country to country 
the company used the following discount rates for its defined benefit pension plans discount rates used for obligations at obligations at obligations at december  and expense december  and expense december  and in in expense in kronos and nl plans us germany canada norway medite plan the assumed long rate return on plan assets represents the estimated average rate of earnings expected to be earned on the funds invested or to be invested in the plans assets provided to fund the benefit payments inherent in the projected benefit obligations 
unlike the discount rate  which is adjusted each year based on changes in current long term interest rates  the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets will not necessarily change based upon the actual  short term performance of the plan assets in any given year 
defined benefit pension expense each year is based upon the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets for each plan and the actual fair value of the plan assets as of the beginning of the year 
differences between the expected return on plan assets for a given year and the actual return are deferred and amortized over future periods based either upon the expected average remaining service life of the active plan participants for plans for which benefits are still being earned by active employees or the average remaining life expectancy of the inactive participants for plans for which benefits are not still being earned by active employees 
at december   approximately of the plan assets for all of the company s defined benefit pension plans related to plans sponsored by nl and kronos  and the remainder related to the medite plan 
of the amount attributable to plans sponsored by nl and kronos  approximately   and related to plan assets for kronos plans in the us  germany  canada and norway  respectively 
the company uses several different long term rates of return on plan asset assumptions in determining its consolidated defined benefit pension plan expense because the company maintains defined benefit pension plans in several different countries in north america and europe  the plan assets in different countries are invested in a different mix of investments and the long term rates of return for different investments differs from country to country 
in determining the expected long term rate of return on plan asset assumptions  the company considers the long term asset mix eg equity vs 
fixed income for the assets for each of its plans and the expected long term rates of return for such asset components 
in addition  the company receives advice about appropriate long term rates of return from the company s third party actuaries 
such assumed asset mixes are summarized below o during  the nl plan assets in the us were invested in the combined master retirement trust cmrt  a collective investment trust established by valhi to permit the collective investment by certain master trusts which fund certain employee benefits plans sponsored by contran and certain of its affiliates 
harold simmons is the sole trustee of the cmrt 
the cmrt s long term investment objective is to provide a rate of return exceeding a composite of broad market equity and fixed income indices including the s p and certain russell indices utilizing both third party investment managers as well as investments directed by mr 
simmons 
during the year history of the cmrt  through december  the average annual rate of return has been approximately 
prior to  nl s us plan assets were invested with a combination of equity and fixed income managers 
o in germany  the composition of kronos plan assets is established to satisfy the requirements of the german insurance commissioner 
the current plan asset allocation at december  was to equity managers and to fixed income managers 
o in canada  kronos currently has a plan asset target allocation of to equity managers and to fixed income managers  with an expected long term rate of return for such investments to average approximately basis points above the applicable equity or fixed income index 
the current plan asset allocation at december  was to equity managers and to fixed income managers 
o in norway  kronos currently has a plan asset target allocation of to equity managers and to fixed income managers  with an expected long term rate of return for such investments of approximately and  respectively 
the current plan asset allocation at december  was to equity managers and to fixed income managers 
o in the us  the medite plan assets are also invested in the cmrt 
the company regularly reviews its actual asset allocation for each of its plans  and will periodically rebalance the investments in each plan to more accurately reflect the targeted allocation when considered appropriate 
the assumed long term rates of return on plan assets used for purposes of determining net period pension cost for  and were as follows kronos and nl plans us germany canada norway medite plan the company currently expects to utilize the same long term rates of return on plan asset assumptions in as it used in for purposes of determining the defined benefit pension plan expense 
to the extent that a plan s particular pension benefit formula calculates the pension benefit in whole or in part based upon future compensation levels  the projected benefit obligations and the pension expense will be based in part upon expected increases in future compensation levels 
for all of the company s plans for which the benefit formula is so calculated  the company generally bases the assumed expected increase in future compensation levels based upon average long term inflation rates for the applicable country 
in addition to the actuarial assumptions discussed above  because kronos maintains defined benefit pension plans outside the us  the amount of recognized defined benefit pension expense and the amount of prepaid and accrued pension costs will vary based upon relative changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
based on the actuarial assumptions described above and kronos and nl s current expectations for what actual average foreign currency exchange rates will be during  kronos and nl expect their aggregate defined benefit pension expense will approximate million in in comparison  kronos and nl expect to be required to make approximately million of aggregate contributions to such plans during the expected amount of defined benefit pension expense and contributions for for the medite plan is not significant 
as noted above  defined benefit pension expense and the amounts recognized as prepaid and accrued pension costs are based upon the actuarial assumptions discussed above 
the company believes all of the actuarial assumptions used are reasonable and appropriate 
if kronos and nl had lowered the assumed discount rates by basis points for all of their plans as of december   their aggregate projected benefit obligations would have increased by approximately million at that date  and their aggregate defined benefit pension expense would be expected to increase by approximately million during similarly  if kronos and nl lowered the assumed long term rates of return on plan assets by basis points for all of their plans  their defined benefit pension expense would be expected to increase by approximately  during similar assumed changes with respect to the discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan assets for the medite plan would not be significant 
opeb plans 
certain subsidiaries of the company currently provide certain health care and life insurance benefits for eligible retired employees 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
at december   approximately of the company s aggregate accrued opeb costs relate to nl and kronos  and substantially all of the remainder relates to tremont 
kronos provides such opeb benefits to retirees in canada  and nl and tremont provide such opeb benefits to retirees in the us the company accounts for such opeb costs under sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
under sfas no 
 opeb expense and accrued opeb costs are based on certain actuarial assumptions  principally the assumed discount rate and the assumed rate of increases in future health care costs 
the company recognized consolidated opeb expense of  in   in and  in similar to defined benefit pension benefits  the amount of funding will differ from the expense recognized for financial reporting purposes  and contributions to the plans to cover benefit payments aggregated million in  million in and million in the assumed discount rates the company utilizes for determining opeb expense and the related accrued opeb obligations are generally based on the same discount rates the company utilizes for its us and canadian defined benefit pension plans 
in estimating the health care cost trend rate  the company considers its actual health care cost experience  future benefit structures  industry trends and advice from its third party actuaries 
during each of the past three years  the company has assumed that the relative increase in health care costs will generally trend downward over the next several years  reflecting  among other things  assumed increases in efficiency in the health care system and industry wide cost containment initiatives 
for example  at december   the expected rate of increase in future health care costs ranges from to in  declining to rates of between and in and thereafter 
based on the actuarial assumptions described above and nl s current expectation for what actual average foreign currency exchange rates will be during  the company expects its consolidated opeb expense will approximate million in in comparison  the company expects to be required to make approximately million of contributions to such plans during as noted above  opeb expense and the amount recognized as accrued opeb costs are based upon the actuarial assumptions discussed above 
the company believes all of the actuarial assumptions used are reasonable and appropriate 
if the company had lowered the assumed discount rates by basis points for all of its opeb plans as of december   the company s aggregate projected benefit obligations would have increased by approximately million at that date  and the company s opeb expense would be expected to increase by less than  during similarly  if the assumed future health care cost trend rate had been increased by basis points  the company s accumulated opeb obligations would have increased by approximately million at december   and opeb expense would have increased by  in foreign operations kronos 
kronos has substantial operations located outside the united states principally europe and canada for which the functional currency is not the us dollar 
as a result  the reported amount of kronos assets and liabilities related to its non us operations  and therefore the company s consolidated net assets  will fluctuate based upon changes in currency exchange rates 
as of january   the functional currency of nl s german  belgian  dutch and french operations had been converted to the euro from their respective national currencies 
at december   kronos had substantial net assets denominated in the euro  canadian dollar  norwegian kroner and british pound sterling 
compx 
compx has substantial operations and assets located outside the united states  principally slide and or ergonomic product operations in canada  the netherlands and taiwan 
as of january   the functional currency of compx s thomas regout operations in the netherlands had been converted to the euro from its national currency dutch guilders 
timet 
timet also has substantial operations and assets located in europe  principally in the united kingdom  france and italy 
the united kingdom has not adopted the euro 
approximately of timet s european sales are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  principally the british pound and the euro 
certain purchases of raw materials for timet s european operations  principally titanium sponge and alloys  are denominated in us dollars while labor and other production costs are primarily denominated in local currencies 
the us dollar value of timet s foreign sales and operating costs are subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations that can impact reported earnings 
liquidity and capital resources summary the company s primary source of liquidity on an ongoing basis is its cash flows from operating activities  which is generally used to i fund capital expenditures  ii repay short term indebtedness incurred primarily for working capital purposes and iii provide for the payment of dividends including dividends paid to valhi by its subsidiaries 
in addition  from time to time the company will incur indebtedness  generally to i fund short term working capital needs  ii refinance existing indebtedness  iii make investments in marketable and other securities including the acquisition of securities issued by subsidiaries and affiliates of the company or iii fund major capital expenditures or the acquisition of other assets outside the ordinary course of business 
also  the company will from time to time sell assets outside the ordinary course of business  the proceeds of which are generally used to i repay existing indebtedness including indebtedness which may have been collateralized by the assets sold  ii make investments in marketable and other securities  iii fund major capital expenditures or the acquisition of other assets outside the ordinary course of business or iv pay dividends 
at december   the company s third party indebtedness aggregated million  of which has a maturity date on or after january  accordingly  the company does not currently expect that a significant amount of its cash flows from operating activities generated in will be required to be used to repay indebtedness 
consolidated cash flows operating activities 
trends in cash flows from operating activities excluding the impact of significant asset dispositions and relative changes in assets and liabilities are generally similar to trends in the company s earnings 
however  certain items included in the determination of net income are non cash  and therefore such items have no impact on cash flows from operating activities 
non cash items included in the determination of net income include depreciation and amortization expense  non cash interest expense  asset impairment charges and unrealized securities transactions gains and losses 
non cash interest expense relates principally to valhi and nl and consists of amortization of original issue discount on certain indebtedness and amortization of deferred financing costs 
in addition  substantially all of the proceeds resulting from nl s legal settlements in are shown as restricted cash  and therefore such settlements had no impact on cash flows from operating activities 
certain other items included in the determination of net income may have an impact on cash flows from operating activities  but the impact of such items on cash flows from operating activities will differ from their impact on net income 
for example  equity in earnings of affiliates will generally differ from the amount of distributions received from such affiliates  and equity in losses of affiliates does not necessarily result in current cash outlays paid to such affiliates 
the amount of periodic defined benefit pension plan expense and periodic opeb expense depends upon a number of factors  including certain actuarial assumptions  and changes in such actuarial assumptions will result in a change in the reported expense 
in addition  the amount of such periodic expense generally differs from the outflows of cash required to be currently paid for such benefits 
also  proceeds from the disposal of marketable securities classified as trading securities are reported as a component of cash flows from operating activities  and such proceeds will generally differ from the amount of the related gain or loss on disposal 
certain other items included in the determination of net income have no impact on cash flows from operating activities  but such items do impact cash flows from investing activities although their impact on such cash flows differs from their impact on net income 
for example  realized gains and losses from the disposal of available for sale marketable securities and long lived assets are included in the determination of net income  although the proceeds from any such disposal are shown as part of cash flows from investing activities 
similarly  nl s insurance gain in related to the property destroyed by fire at its leverkusen facility is included in the determination of net income  but the proceeds received from the insurance company for property damage reimbursements are also shown as cash flows from investing activities 
changes in product pricing  production volumes and customer demand  among other things  could significantly affect the liquidity of the company 
relative changes in assets and liabilities generally result from the timing of production  sales  purchases and income tax payments 
such relative changes can significantly impact the comparability of cash flow from operations from period to period  as the income statement impact of such items may occur in a different period from when the underlying cash transaction occurs

to the extent that actual developments differ from kronos expectations  kronos liquidity could be adversely affected 
pricing within the tio industry is cyclical  and changes in industry economic conditions significantly impact kronos earnings and operating cash flows 
cash flow from operations is considered the primary source of liquidity for kronos 
changes in tio pricing  production volume and customer demand  among other things  could significantly affect the liquidity of kronos

examples of such proposed legislation include bills which would permit civil liability for damages on the basis of market share  rather than requiring plaintiffs to prove that the defendant s product caused the alleged damage  and bills which would revive actions barred by the statute of limitations 
while no legislation or regulations have been enacted to date that are expected to have a material adverse effect on nl s consolidated financial position  results of operations or liquidity  imposition of market share liability or other legislation could have such an effect

timet at december   timet had million of borrowing availability under its various us and european credit agreements

timet received the advance of million from boeing in january timet has a us asset based revolving credit agreement that provides for borrowings up to the lesser of million or a formula determined borrowing base derived from the value of timet s accounts receivable  inventories and equipment 
this facility requires timet s us daily cash receipts to be used to reduce outstanding borrowings  which may then be reborrowed  subject to the terms of the agreement 
borrowings are collateralized by substantially all of timet s us assets 
the credit agreement prohibits the payment of dividends on the convertible preferred securities issued by a wholly owned subsidiary of timet if excess availability  as defined  is less than million  limits additional indebtedness  prohibits the payment of dividends on timet s common stock if excess availability is less than million  requires compliance with certain financial covenants and contains other covenants customary in lending transactions of this type

were an unfavorable outcome to occur in any given period  it is possible that it could have a material adverse impact on timet s consolidated results of operations or cash flows in a particular period 
at december   a wholly owned subsidiary of timet had issued  shares outstanding of its convertible preferred securities  representing an aggregate million liquidation amount  that mature in each security is convertible into shares of timet common stock at a conversion rate of 
shares of timet common stock per convertible preferred security 
such convertible preferred securities do not require principal amortization  and timet has the right to defer distributions on the convertible preferred securities for one or more quarters of up to consecutive quarters  provided that such deferral period may not extend past the maturity date 
timet is prohibited from  among other things  paying dividends or reacquiring its capital stock while distributions are being deferred on the convertible preferred securities

distributions will continue to accrue at the coupon rate on the liquidation amount and unpaid distributions 
this deferral was effective starting with timet s december  scheduled payment 
timet will consider resuming payment of distributions on the convertible preferred securities once the outlook for timet s business improves substantially

general corporate valhi because valhi s operations are conducted primarily through its subsidiaries and affiliates  valhi s long term ability to meet its parent company level corporate obligations is dependent in large measure on the receipt of dividends or other distributions from its subsidiaries and affiliates 
in february  kronos announced it would pay its first regular quarterly cash dividend of 
per share 
at that rate  and based on the million shares of kronos held directly or indirectly by valhi at december  including million held by tremont llc  a wholly owned subsidiary of valhi  valhi would directly or indirectly receive aggregate annual dividends from kronos of million 
nl  which paid regular quarterly cash dividends of 
per share in  announced in february that it would pay its first quarter regular quarterly dividend of 
per share in the form of shares of kronos common stock 
compx suspended its regular quarterly dividend in the second quarter of  timet is currently prohibited from paying dividends on its common stock due to its election to defer payment of interest on its convertible securities  and the company does not currently expect to receive any distributions from waste control specialists during various credit agreements to which certain subsidiaries or affiliates are parties contain customary limitations on the payment of dividends  typically a percentage of net income or cash flow  however  such restrictions in the past have not significantly impacted valhi s ability to service its parent company level obligations 
valhi has not guaranteed any indebtedness of its subsidiaries or affiliates 
to the extent that one or more of valhi s subsidiaries were to become unable to maintain its current level of dividends  either due to restrictions contained in the applicable subsidiary s credit agreements or otherwise  valhi parent company s liquidity could become adversely impacted 
in such an event  valhi might consider reducing or eliminating its dividend or selling interests in subsidiaries or other assets 
at december   valhi had million of parent level cash and cash equivalents  had million outstanding under its revolving bank credit agreement and had million of short term demand loans payable to contran 
in addition  valhi had million of borrowing availability under its million revolving bank credit facility 
the terms of the amalgamated sugar company llc company agreement provide for annual base level of cash dividend distributions sometimes referred to as distributable cash by the llc of million  from which the company is entitled to a preferential share 
distributions from the llc are dependent  in part  upon the operations of the llc 
the company records dividend distributions from the llc as income upon receipt  which occurs in the same month in which they are declared by the llc 
to the extent the llc s distributable cash is below this base level in any given year  the company is entitled to an additional preferential share of any future annual llc distributable cash in excess of the base level until such shortfall is recovered 
based on the llc s current projections for  valhi currently expects that distributions received from the llc in will approximate its debt service requirements under its million loans from snake river sugar company 
certain covenants contained in snake river s third party senior debt allow snake river to pay periodic installments of debt service payments principal and interest under valhi s million loan to snake river prior to its current scheduled maturity in  and such loan is subordinated to snake river s third party senior debt 
at december   the accrued and unpaid interest on the million loan to snake river aggregated million and is classified as a noncurrent asset 
the company currently believes it will ultimately realize both the million principal amount and the accrued and unpaid interest  whether through cash generated from the future operations of snake river and the llc or otherwise including any liquidation of snake river or the llc 
following the currently scheduled complete repayment of snake river s third party senior debt in april  valhi believes it will receive significant debt service payments on its loan to snake river as the cash flows that snake river previously would have been using to fund debt service on its third party senior debt million in would then become available  and would be required  to be used to fund debt service payments on its loan from valhi 
prior to the repayment of the third party senior debt  snake river might also make debt service payments to valhi  if permitted by the terms of the senior debt 
the company may  at its option  require the llc to redeem the company s interest in the llc beginning in  and the llc has the right to redeem the company s interest in the llc beginning in the redemption price is generally million plus the amount of certain undistributed income allocable to the company 
in the event the company requires the llc to redeem the company s interest in the llc  snake river has the right to accelerate the maturity of and call valhi s million loans from snake river 
redemption of the company s interest in the llc would result in the company reporting income related to the disposition of its llc interest for both financial reporting and income tax purposes 
however  because of snake river s ability to call its million loans to valhi upon redemption of the company s interest in the llc  the net cash proceeds after repayment of the debt generated by redemption of the company s interest in the llc could be less than the income taxes that would become payable as a result of the disposition 
the company routinely compares its liquidity requirements and alternative uses of capital against the estimated future cash flows to be received from its subsidiaries  and the estimated sales value of those units 
as a result of this process  the company has in the past and may in the future seek to raise additional capital  refinance or restructure indebtedness  repurchase indebtedness in the market or otherwise  modify its dividend policies  consider the sale of interests in subsidiaries  affiliates  business units  marketable securities or other assets  or take a combination of such steps or other steps  to increase liquidity  reduce indebtedness and fund future activities 
such activities have in the past and may in the future involve related companies 
the company and related entities routinely evaluate acquisitions of interests in  or combinations with  companies  including related companies  perceived by management to be undervalued in the marketplace 
these companies may or may not be engaged in businesses related to the company s current businesses 
the company intends to consider such acquisition activities in the future and  in connection with this activity  may consider issuing additional equity securities and increasing the indebtedness of the company  its subsidiaries and related companies

non gaap financial measures in an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding the company s results of operations as determined by gaap  the company has disclosed certain non gaap information which the company believes provides useful information to investors o the company discloses percentage changes in kronos average tio selling prices in billing currencies  which excludes the effects of foreign currency translation 
the company believes disclosure of such percentage changes allows investors to analyze such changes without the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  thereby facilitating period to period comparisons of the relative changes in average selling prices in the actual various billing currencies 
generally  when the us dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies  the percentage change in average selling prices in billing currencies will be higher or lower  respectively  than such percentage changes would be using actual exchange rates prevailing during the respective periods

the actual amount of material purchased  and therefore the actual amount that would be payable by the company  may vary from such estimated amounts 
in addition  the company is a party to certain other agreements that conditionally commit the company to pay certain amounts in the future 
due to the provisions of such agreements  it is possible that the company might not ever be required to pay any amounts under these agreements 
agreements to which the company is a party that fall into this category  more fully described in notes  and to the consolidated financial statements  are described below 
the company has not included any amounts for these conditional commitments in the above table because the company currently believes it is not probable that the company will be required to pay any amounts pursuant to these agreements 
o the company s requirement to escrow funds in amounts up to the next three years of debt service of snake river s third party term debt to collateralize such debt in order to exercise its conditional right to temporarily take control of the amalgamated sugar company llc  o the company s requirement to pledge million of cash or marketable securities as collateral for snake river s third party debt in order to permit snake river to continue to make debt service payments on its million loan from valhi  and o waste control specialists requirement to pay certain amounts based upon specified percentages of qualifying revenues

earnings are primarily affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to the euro  the canadian dollar  the norwegian kroner and the british pound sterling 
as described above  at december   nl had the equivalent of million of outstanding euro denominated indebtedness the equivalent of million of euro denominated indebtedness and million of norwegian kroner denominated indebtedness 
the potential increase in the us dollar equivalent of the principal amount outstanding resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in exchange rates at such date would be approximately million at december  million 
certain of compx s sales generated by its canadian operations are denominated in us dollars 
to manage a portion of the foreign exchange rate market risk associated with such receivables or similar exchange rate risk associated with future sales  at december  compx had entered into a series of short term forward exchange contracts maturing through february to exchange an aggregate of million for an equivalent amount of canadian dollars at an exchange rates of cdn 
to cdn 
per us dollar contracts to exchange an aggregate of million for an equivalent amount of canadian dollars maturing through january 
the estimated fair value of such forward exchange contracts at december  and is not material 
at december   the company also had entered into a short term currency forward contract maturing on january  to exchange an aggregate of euro million into us dollars at an exchange rate of us per euro 
such contract was entered into in conjunction with the january payment of an intercompany dividend from one of the company s european subsidiaries 
at december   the actual exchange rate was us per euro 
the estimated fair value of such foreign currency forward contract was not material at december  marketable equity and debt security prices 
the company is exposed to market risk due to changes in prices of the marketable securities which are owned 
the fair value of such debt and equity securities at december  and was million and million  respectively 
the potential change in the aggregate fair value of these investments  assuming a change in prices  would be million at december  and million at december  other 
the company believes there may be a certain amount of incompleteness in the sensitivity analyses presented above 
for example  the hypothetical effect of changes in interest rates discussed above ignores the potential effect on other variables which affect the company s results of operations and cash flows  such as demand for the company s products  sales volumes and selling prices and operating expenses 
contrary to the above assumptions  changes in interest rates rarely result in simultaneous comparable shifts along the yield curve 
also  certain of the company s marketable securities are exchangeable for certain of the company s debt instruments  and a decrease in the fair value of such securities would likely be mitigated by a decrease in the fair value of the related indebtedness 
accordingly  the amounts presented above are not necessarily an accurate reflection of the potential losses the company would incur assuming the hypothetical changes in market prices were actually to occur 
the above discussion and estimated sensitivity analysis amounts include forward looking statements of market risk which assume hypothetical changes in market prices 
actual future market conditions will likely differ materially from such assumptions 
accordingly  such forward looking statements should not be considered to be projections by the company of future events  gains or losses
