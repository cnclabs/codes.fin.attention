in this discussion  the words harrah s entertainment  company  we  our  and us refer to harrah s entertainment  inc  together with its subsidiaries where appropriate 
overall operating results in  our revenues increased for the sixth consecutive year  but income from operations declined from higher gaming taxes  significant supply additions and a sluggish economy made for a difficult operating environment 
organic growth  growth through investment and growth through new business development remain priorities of our company  and costs associated with initiatives to position the company for another period of sustained growth contributed to the decline in income from continuing operations in versus the prior year 
percentage increase decrease in millions  except earnings per share vs vs casino revenues    total revenues    income from operations income from continuing operations net income earnings per share diluted from continuing operations net income operating margin pts pts total revenues grew in  primarily as a result of a full year of consolidation of jazz casino company llc jcc into our financial results compared to the partial year in following our acquisition of a controlling interest in that property  our acquisition of louisiana downs  inc louisiana downs in december and the subsequent introduction of slot machines at that property in mid  and the contributions received from recent targeted capital investments 
in  our income from operations decreased due primarily to increased gaming taxes in several states and increased development costs 
net income increased and diluted earnings per share increased over our results  due to a million net charge recorded in for the impairment of intangible assets acquired in our acquisition of rio hotel and casino  inc rio

the purchase included the harveys resort casino in lake tahoe  nevada  the harveys casino hotel and the bluffs run casino  both in council bluffs  iowa  and the harveys wagon wheel hotel casino in central city  colorado 
the addition of the harveys properties expanded our geographic distribution  increased our nationwide casino square footage by almost and added  hotel rooms  table games and  slot machines to serve our customers 
the acquisition introduced our total rewards customer loyalty program to million potential new customers within miles of council bluffs and strengthened our relationships with customers throughout the nevada northern california gaming market 
with our acquisition of harveys  we assumed a million contingent liability  which was dependent on the results of a referendum that was decided by the voters in pottawattamie county  iowa  in november the referendum  which re approved gaming at racetracks and on riverboats for another eight years  passed and we paid an additional million in acquisition costs in fourth quarter in second quarter  we sold harveys wagon wheel hotel casino in central city  colorado  which we had concluded was a nonstrategic asset for us 
a loss of million  net of tax  was recorded on this sale 
the colorado property has been presented in our financial statements as discontinued operations since  and our results were reclassified to reflect that property as discontinued operations 
jazz casino company on june   we acquired additional shares of jcc s common stock  which increased our ownership from to and required a change in our accounting treatment for our investment in jcc from the equity method to consolidation of jcc in our financial statements 
we began consolidating jcc in our financial results on june  on december   we acquired all of the remaining shares of jcc s stock to increase our ownership to 
we paid million per share for the additional ownership interest in jcc  acquired approximately million of jcc s debt  assumed approximately million of jcc s senior notes  which we subsequently retired  and incurred approximately million of acquisition costs 
we financed the acquisition and retired jcc s debt with funds from various sources  including cash flows from operations and borrowings under our established debt programs 
louisiana downs on december   we acquired a controlling interest in louisiana downs  a thoroughbred racetrack in bossier city  louisiana 
the agreement gave harrah s a ownership interest in a company that now owns both louisiana downs and harrah s shreveport 
in may  approximately slot machines were put into service and louisiana downs became the only land based gaming facility in northern louisiana 
we expect to open a new  permanent facility with approximately  slot machines by second quarter we paid approximately million  including million in short term notes that were paid in full in january and million in equity interest in harrah s shreveport  for the interest in louisiana downs and approximately million of acquisition costs 
we financed the acquisition with funds from various sources  including cash flows from operations and borrowings under our established debt programs 
subsequent to the end of  we reached an agreement with the minority owners of the company that owns louisiana downs and harrah s shreveport to purchase their ownership interest in that company 
the agreement is subject to customary approvals and is expected to be consummated by the end of first quarter any excess of the cost to purchase the minority ownership above the capital balances will be assigned to goodwill 
harrah s east chicago buyout of minority partners in second quarter  we paid approximately million to former partners in the harrah s east chicago property to settle outstanding litigation with the partners relating to a buyout in of the partners interest in the property and to terminate the contractual rights of the partners to repurchase an interest in the property 
the two remaining minority partners in our east chicago property owned  in aggregate  of this property 
in december and january  we acquired these ownership interests for aggregate consideration of approximately million 
as a result of these transactions  the east chicago property is now wholly owned 
in addition to these completed transactions  we have announced the following planned acquisitions 
horseshoe gaming on september   we announced that we had signed a definitive agreement to acquire horseshoe gaming for billion  including assumption of debt 
a million escrow payment was made in  and under certain circumstances  this amount would be forfeited if the acquisition does not close 
we expect to finance the acquisition through working capital  existing credit facilities and or  depending on market conditions  the issuance of new debt 
the purchase includes casinos in hammond  indiana  tunica  mississippi  and bossier city  louisiana 
we also announced our intention to sell our harrah s brand casino in shreveport to avoid overexposure in that market  and in january  we announced that we have an agreement  subject to regulatory approvals  to sell that property to another gaming company 
after consideration of the sale of harrah s shreveport  the horseshoe acquisition will add a net  square feet of casino space  more than  slot machines and table games to our existing portfolio 
this acquisition will give harrah s rights to the horseshoe brand in all of the united states  except in nevada 
the acquisition  which is subject to regulatory approvals  is expected to close in the first half of binion s horseshoe hotel and casino pursuant to two separate transactions that we announced in january and february  we will acquire certain intellectual property assets from horseshoe club operating company  to secure the rights to the horseshoe brand in nevada and to the world series of poker brand and tournament  while mtr gaming group  inc will acquire the remaining assets of the binion s horseshoe hotel and casino in las vegas  nevada  including the right to use the name binion s at the property  from horseshoe club operating company 
we will operate the hotel and casino jointly with mtr gaming on an interim basis 
we expect to complete each of these transactions during the first quarter of regional results and development plans the executive decision makers of our company review operating results  assess performance and make decisions related to the allocation of resources on a property by property basis 
we  therefore  believe that each property is an operating segment and that it is appropriate to aggregate and present the operations of our company as one reportable segment 
in order to provide more detail in a more understandable manner than would be possible on a consolidated basis  our properties have been grouped as follows to facilitate discussion of our operating results west east north central south central managed other harrah s reno harrah s harveys lake tahoe bill s harrah s las vegas rio harrah s laughlin harrah s atlantic city showboat atlantic city harrah s joliet harrah s east chicago harrah s north kansas city harrah s council bluffs bluffs run harrah s st

revenues at harrah s las vegas were higher than in  and income from operations was up 
rio s revenues increased in  and income from operations was over last year 
revenues and income from operations were up and  respectively  at harrah s laughlin 
revenues were higher than revenues in southern nevada  where record revenues at harrah s las vegas and laughlin more than offset the year over year decline in revenues at rio 
revenues at harrah s las vegas and laughlin increased and  respectively  while revenues at rio were below revenues 
income from operations in southern nevada increased over  driven primarily by improved performance at the rio due to cost management measures and the property s decision to exit the high end international table games business in third quarter a charge of million was recorded in to recognize the cost of this decision 
cost management measures also contributed to the improved performance in at harrah s las vegas and laughlin where income from operations grew and  respectively from northern nevada northern nevada revenues rose in  but income from operations was down 
our northern nevada properties faced the challenge of increased competition from indian casinos in california and weak retail and unrated play play by customers without a total rewards card 
increased utilization of air charter programs and targeted marketing programs helped maintain revenues  but the costs of these programs resulted in some margin erosion 
with the expectation of continued expansion of indian gaming in california  we believe that achieving growth at our northern nevada properties  particularly in reno  will be a challenge 
our lake tahoe properties will be less affected due to the unique destination qualities of that market and successful execution of our cross marketing strategy 
in our annual assessment of goodwill and other nonamortizing intangible assets  we determined that the remaining goodwill associated with our reno property was impaired 
a charge of approximately million  representing the remaining unamortized goodwill at reno  was taken in the fourth quarter of for this impairment 
northern nevada posted record revenues in due to the inclusion of a full year s revenues from the harveys casino  which was acquired on july  this property contributed million to northern nevada revenues in excluding revenues contributed by harveys from both periods  northern nevada revenues were down from due to weak market conditions in the reno area caused  in part  by heightened levels of competition from indian casinos in the northern california area 
income from operations was higher than in  due also to the inclusion of a full year s results from harveys lake tahoe and to cost synergies associated with the integration of the harveys property into harrah s systems 
east results percentage increase decrease in millions vs vs casino revenues total revenues income from operations operating margin pt pts contributions from recent investments at our atlantic city properties and execution of a highly targeted marketing program helped offset the impact of a new competitor in the atlantic city market in at showboat atlantic city  where a new hotel tower opened in second quarter and slot machines were added in third quarter  revenues were up and income from operations was higher than in harrah s atlantic city s revenues and income from operations declined and  respectively  from levels  as that property was more affected by the opening of the first new competitor in atlantic city in more than a decade 
an additional slot machines were added at this property in december revenues at harrah s atlantic city increased for the sixth consecutive year in  and its income from operations  which increased for the fourth consecutive year  was higher than in these increases were driven by the opening of the new hotel tower and the addition of approximately slot machines at this property in second quarter and by more cost effective marketing programs 
the room addition increased the hotel s capacity to more than  rooms and completed a project that created an additional  square feet of casino floor space and expanded a buffet area 
these capital improvements cost approximately million 
revenues at showboat atlantic city increased in and its income from operations was higher than in property enhancements and more cost effective marketing drove the improved results at this property 
this property  which is more reliant on customers who travel to atlantic city by bus  was impacted by the september   terrorist attacks and construction disruptions related to reconfiguration of the casino floor 
a reconfiguration of showboat s casino floor was completed in the second quarter of  a new buffet and coffee shop opened in the fourth quarter of and our tiered total rewards customer loyalty program was implemented during at this property 
north central results percentage increase decrease in millions vs vs casino revenues    total revenues    income from operations operating margin pts pts higher gaming taxes and competitive pressures in led to declines in revenues and income from operations at our north central properties 
the revenue and income from operations increases reported by the north central properties for versus were due to inclusion of a full year of operations of the harveys properties  which were acquired july  the year over year growth was also enhanced by capital investments that generated strong customer demand and higher cash flow 
chicagoland illinois combined revenues and income from operations at our chicagoland illinois properties were and  respectively  below higher gaming and admission taxes  heightened competition and winter storms during the first quarter of were responsible for the declines 
during second quarter  legislation was passed in indiana that increased the effective tax rate and retroactively revised the methodology by which state gaming taxes are to be computed for those properties that converted from cruising to dockside operations 
this revision resulted in a million charge for additional taxes for the period ended june  new tax legislation in illinois in raised the maximum gaming tax rate to and impacted our income from operations by million in in order to sustain profitability under the higher tax scheme  operational changes were implemented at joliet in the third quarter  and revenues declined as a result of these changes 
revenue declines at joliet were partially offset by higher revenues from our east chicago property  which benefited from a full year of dockside operations 
a million renovation project designed to enhance the amenities and update the look of harrah s east chicago is scheduled for completion in first quarter at december   million had been spent on this project 
combined revenues at our chicagoland illinois properties were higher than in and income from operations was up 
income from operations was negatively impacted by accelerated depreciation on riverboats that were removed from service at harrah s joliet in late september  when the property was converted from riverboats to barges 
income from operations was negatively impacted by approximately million of additional gaming taxes in illinois and indiana due to state legislations effective july  the illinois legislation raised the maximum graduated gaming tax rate from to  and in indiana the base gaming tax rate increased from to 
the indiana legislation also included provisions that allowed casinos to convert from cruising to dockside operations 
if a casino elected to become a dockside operation  the gaming tax rate structure changed to a graduated scale with a maximum tax rate of  mitigated to some extent by a change in the method for computing admission taxes 
we converted our harrah s east chicago operation from cruising to dockside during third quarter in first quarter  we completed the opening of a million hotel at harrah s east chicago 
the first floors of the floor hotel opened in late december missouri combined revenues for our missouri properties declined from and income from operations was down due primarily to heightened competition in both the st 
louis and north kansas city markets 
fourth quarter results for harrah s st 
louis were strong  and we are optimistic that this property will continue to rebound from the increased competition in that market 
in the kansas city market  a competitor opened its expanded facility in third quarter and another competitor opened its new barge facility in fourth quarter construction is underway on a million expansion at harrah s st 
louis  which will include a second hotel tower  redesign of the hotel lobby  new valet parking areas  the addition of parking garage express ramps and the expansion of two restaurants and other amenities 
a new restaurant and nightclub are scheduled to open at the end of first quarter and the hotel tower and remaining amenities are due to open in third quarter as of december   million had been spent on this project 
combined revenues for our missouri properties were below revenues  and income from operations was below due to increased competition and intense promotional activity in the st 
louis market 
iowa combined revenues from our iowa properties were above revenues  but income from operations was below due  in part  to higher gaming taxes at our bluffs run property  where gaming taxes increased in accordance with a predetermined rate increase 
on a combined basis  our two iowa properties contributed million in revenues and million in income from operations to our results compared to million in revenues and million in income from operations for the five months that we owned these properties in the iowa supreme court issued an opinion in june that has the effect of reducing the gaming tax rate on gaming revenues earned by casinos at racetracks operating in the state  including our bluffs run casino 
casinos at racetracks are taxed at a higher rate in than the casinos on riverboats operating in iowa 
the court ruled this disparity was unconstitutional 
the state appealed the iowa supreme court s decision to the united states supreme court and in june  the united states supreme court overturned the ruling by the iowa supreme court on us constitutional grounds  however  in february  the iowa supreme court ruled that the state law that permits the disparity violates the iowa constitution 
we followed the instructions of the iowa racing and gaming commission to pay taxes at the rate for bluffs run 
however  given the uncertainty of this situation  we continued to accrue gaming taxes at the higher rate and have accrued approximately million in state gaming taxes that we may not have to pay 
an additional payment based on a multiple of the calculated annual savings may be due to iowa west racing association iowa west  the entity holding the pari mutuel and gaming license for the bluffs run casino and with whom we have a management agreement to operate that property 
any additional payment that may be due to iowa west would increase goodwill attributed to the bluffs run property 
south central results percentage increase decrease in millions vs vs casino revenues total revenues income from operations operating margin pts pts a full year of consolidation of new orleans results subsequent to the acquisition of a controlling interest in that property in early june and results from louisiana downs  which was acquired in december  drove combined revenues at our south central properties up and combined income from operations up 
harrah s new orleans contributed million in revenues and million in income from operations in compared to million in revenues and million in income from operations subsequent to its consolidation in the opening of an expanded buffet and new steakhouse at harrah s new orleans in attracted new business to that property 
prior to our acquisition of a controlling interest in that property  we had limited ability to invest in amenities  and we are now actively pursuing such opportunities 
we are currently in the design stage for a new hotel project for this property 
on december   we completed our acquisition of a controlling interest in louisiana downs  a thoroughbred racetrack in bossier city  louisiana  and in may  slot machines were placed in service there 
construction is scheduled for completion in second quarter on phase ii of the expansion of louisiana downs  which will include a new  permanent facility with approximately  slot machines 
our renovation and expansion of louisiana downs is expected to cost approximately million  million of which had been spent as of december  louisiana downs contributed million in revenues in  but preopening costs related to the introduction of slot machines at the facility drove a loss from operations of million 
the increases in combined results for our south central properties in over were also due to the consolidation of new orleans results subsequent to the acquisition of a controlling interest in that property in early june our growth was also enhanced by capital investments that generated strong customer demand and higher cash flow at harrah s shreveport 
the lake charles property continues to contend with increased competition in the area  including the addition of slot machines at a racetrack located closer than our property to one of our texas feeder markets and additional indian casino offerings 
approximately million of goodwill is allocated to the lake charles property 
should the negative operating trend at our lake charles property continue  it could impact the annual analysis for the impairment of goodwill for that operating unit 
due to our intention to sell harrah s shreveport  we have classified that property in assets held for sale on our consolidated balance sheets and have ceased depreciating its assets 
since the horseshoe gaming acquisition will give us a continued presence in the shreveport bossier city market  harrah s shreveport s operating results have not been classified as discontinued operations 
we do not anticipate a material gain or loss on this sale 
on june   we announced an agreement to sell harrah s vicksburg and that sale was completed on october  results for harrah s vicksburg are presented as discontinued operations and results for and have been reclassified to conform to the presentation 
a loss of million  net of tax  resulted from this sale

in  we extended our contract to manage the tribal casino at rincon  and we have also executed an extension for management of the cherokee property until november  which is pending approval by the national indian gaming commission 
new contracts may provide for reductions in management fees  however  expansions at the properties are expected to increase the fee base and keep the overall income stream stable 
a million expansion of the harrah s rincon property began in december the expansion will add a story  room hotel tower  a spa  a new hotel lobby  additional meeting space  additional casino space and a  space parking structure 
the expansion is scheduled to be completed by the end of construction is underway on a million expansion project at harrah s prairie band 
the expansion will include the addition of hotel rooms  a  square foot convention center and a new restaurant 
the project is scheduled for completion in late construction began in january on a million expansion of harrah s cherokee smoky mountains casino in cherokee  north carolina  that will add a story  room hotel tower  which is scheduled for completion in second quarter a room hotel and  square foot conference center opened at that property in second quarter  and in fourth quarter  an expansion project was completed that added approximately  square feet of casino space 
an expansion to the harrah s ak chin casino opened in first quarter and included a new room hotel  an additional restaurant  meeting and banquet room facilities  a resort pool and a landscaped courtyard 
a new twenty five year compact between the state of arizona and the ak chin indian community was approved in february the new compact increases the number of permitted machines and adds blackjack and jackpot poker to the scope of gaming at the ak chin casino

in  we signed a letter of intent  subject to definitive documents  to form a joint venture with gala group  a united kingdom uk based gaming operator  to develop regional casinos in the uk 
the arrangement also permits us to develop uk destination resorts outside of the joint venture 
as part of this effort  we formed a joint venture with gala group for the purpose of placing options on land in the uk 
development in the uk is dependent on passage of proposed legislative reform of the uk gaming laws and regulations

corporate expense decreased in from  primarily due to lower incentive compensation plan expenses 
amortization of intangible assets in was basically flat compared to and both years are considerably lower than in due to the implementation of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
in first quarter  whereby we ceased amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives 
certain other intangible assets with defined lives related to acquisitions are being amortized 
see notes and to our consolidated financial statements 
the company s average debt balance was slightly higher in than in  however  interest expense was lower due to lower interest rates throughout on variable rate debt 
our average debt balance was also higher in than in due to acquisitions and our stock repurchase program  but interest expense decreased in from due to lower rates on variable rate debt 
the average interest rate on our variable rate debt  excluding the impact of our swap agreements  was at december  and  compared to at december  a change in interest rates will impact our financial results 
assuming a constant outstanding balance for our variable rate debt for the next twelve months  a hypothetical change in corresponding interest rates would change interest expense for the next twelve months by approximately million 
our variable rate debt  including fixed rate debt for which we have entered into interest rate swap agreements  represents approximately of our total debt  while our fixed rate debt is approximately of our total debt 
for discussion of our interest rate swap agreements  see debt and liquidity  interest rate swap agreements 
losses on the early extinguishments of debt represent premiums paid and write offs of unamortized deferred financing costs associated with debt retired before maturity

the effective tax rate for  as well as for and  is higher than the federal statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes 
the effective tax rate in was also affected by that portion of our goodwill amortization that was not deductible for tax purposes 
with the cessation of goodwill amortization in the first quarter of as the result of the implementation of sfas no 
 our effective tax rate declined from the rate  however  our effective tax rate increased in second quarter due to the exposure to higher state income taxes enacted in that year 
minority interests reflect joint venture partners shares of income at joint venture casinos 
discontinued operations reflect the results of harveys wagon wheel hotel casino in central city  colorado  and harrah s vicksburg  both of which were sold in and results for these two properties have been reclassified to conform to the presentation

the credit agreement matures on april   and consists of a five year revolving credit facility for up to billion and a five year term reducing facility for up to million 
the credit agreement contains a provision that would allow an increase in the borrowing capacity to billion  if mutually acceptable to us and our lenders 
interest on the credit agreement is based on our debt ratings and leverage ratio and is subject to change 
as of december   the credit agreement bore interest based upon points over libor and bore a facility fee for borrowed and unborrowed amounts of basis points 
at our option  we may borrow at the prime rate under the new credit agreement 
as of december   million in borrowings were outstanding under the credit agreement with an additional million committed to back letters of credit 
after consideration of these borrowings  but before consideration of amounts borrowed under the commercial paper program  million of additional borrowing capacity was available to the company as of december  interest rate swap agreements to manage the mix of our debt between fixed and variable rate instruments  we entered into interest rate swap agreements to modify the interest characteristics of our outstanding debt without an exchange of the underlying principal amount 
the differences to be paid or received under the terms of our interest rate swap agreements are accrued as interest rates change and recognized as an adjustment to interest expense for the related debt 
changes in the variable interest rates to be paid or received pursuant to the terms of our interest rate swap agreements will have a corresponding effect on our future cash flows 
these agreements contain a credit risk that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreements 
we minimize that risk by evaluating the creditworthiness of our counterparties  which are limited to major banks and financial institutions  and do not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties 
as of december   we were a party to two interest rate swaps for a total notional amount of million 
these swaps were effective december   and will expire december  subsequent to the end of  we entered into two additional swap agreements for a total notional amount of million  million of which will expire in june  and million of which will expire in december the following table summarizes the terms of our swap agreements

 commercial paper to provide the company with cost effective borrowing flexibility  we have a million commercial paper program that is used to borrow funds for general corporate purposes 
although the debt instruments are short term in tenor  they are classified as long term debt because the commercial paper is backed by our credit agreement  and we have committed to keep available capacity under our credit agreement in an amount equal to or greater than amounts borrowed under this program 
at december   million was outstanding under this program 
issuance of new debt in addition to our credit agreement  we have issued debt and entered into credit agreements to provide the company with cost effective borrowing flexibility and to replace short term 
the table below summarizes the face value of debt obligations entered into during the last three years and outstanding at december  debt issued matures face value outstanding at december  in millions commercial paper senior notes december senior notes january senior notes june extinguishments of debt funds from the new debt discussed above  as well as proceeds from our credit agreement  were used to retire certain of our outstanding debt  in particular those debt obligations assumed in our acquisition transactions  to reduce our effective interest rate and or lengthen maturities 
the following table summarizes the debt obligations  in addition to our previous credit and letter of credit facilities  that we have retired over the last three years 
issuer date retired debt extinguished face value retired in millions harrah s operating company december senior subordinated notes due harrah s operating company august senior subordinated notes due jcc december senior notes due harveys september senior subordinated notes due showboat august senior subordinated notes due harveys july credit facility due in july  our board of directors authorized the company to retire  from time to time through cash purchases  portions of our outstanding debt in open market purchases  privately negotiated transactions or otherwise 
these repurchases will be funded through available cash from operations  borrowings from our credit agreement and our new senior notes 
such repurchases will depend on prevailing market conditions  the company s liquidity requirements  contractual restrictions and other factors 
as of december   million of our senior subordinated notes had been retired under this authorization 
charges of million representing premiums paid and write offs of unamortized deferred financing costs associated with the early retirement of portions of our senior subordinated notes and of our previous credit and letter of credit facilities were recorded in in compliance with sfas no 
 these losses no longer qualify for presentation as extraordinary items and are  therefore  included in income from continuing operations on our consolidated statements of income 
equity repurchase programs during the past three years  our board of directors has authorized plans whereby we have purchased shares of the company s common stock in the open market from time to time as market conditions and other factors warranted 
the table below summarizes the plans in effect during the past three years 
plan authorized number of shares authorized number of shares purchased as of december  average price per share july million million july million million november million million the november authorization was to expire december   but it has been extended until december  the repurchases were funded through available operating cash flows and borrowings from our established debt programs 
guarantees of third party debt and other obligations and commitments the following tables summarize our contractual obligations and other commitments as of december  payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years after years in millions debt    capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase orders obligations guaranteed payments to state of louisiana community reinvestment construction commitments other contractual obligations amount of commitment expiration per period other commitments total amounts committed less than year years years over years in millions guarantees of loans letters of credit minimum payments to tribes the agreements pursuant to which we manage casinos on indian lands contain provisions required by law that provide that a minimum monthly payment be made to the tribe 
that obligation has priority over scheduled repayments of borrowings for development costs and over the management fee earned and paid to the manager 
in the event that insufficient cash flow is generated by the operations to fund this payment  we must pay the shortfall to the tribe 
subject to certain limitations as to time  such advances  if any  would be repaid to us in future periods in which operations generate cash flow in excess of the required minimum payment 
these commitments will terminate upon the occurrence of certain defined events  including termination of the management contract 
our aggregate monthly commitment for the minimum guaranteed payments pursuant to the contracts for the four managed indian owned facilities now open  which extend for periods of up to months from december   is million 
each of these casinos currently generates sufficient cash flows to cover all of their obligations  including their debt service 
we may guarantee all or part of the debt incurred by indian tribes with which we have entered a management contract to fund development of casinos on the indian lands 
for all existing guarantees of indian debt  we have obtained a first lien on certain personal property tangible and intangible of the casino enterprise 
there can be no assurance  however  that the value of such property would satisfy our obligations in the event these guarantees were enforced 
additionally  we have received limited waivers from the indian tribes of their sovereign immunity to allow us to pursue our rights under the contracts between the parties and to enforce collection efforts as to any assets in which a security interest is taken 
the aggregate outstanding balance of such debt as of december   was million 
some of our guarantees of the debt for casinos on indian lands were modified during  triggering the requirements under financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  to recognize a liability for the estimated fair value of those guarantees 
liabilities  representing the fair value of our guarantees  and corresponding assets  representing the portion of our management fee receivable attributable to our agreements to provide the related guarantees  were recorded and are being amortized over the lives of the related agreements 
we estimate the fair value of the obligation by considering what premium would have been required by us or by an unrelated party 
the amounts recognized represent the present value of the premium in interest rates and fees that would have been charged to the tribes if we had not provided the guarantees 
the unamortized balance of the liability for the guarantees and of the related assets at december   was million 
depending upon future changes in the gaming tax rate imposed by the iowa legislature  an additional payment based on a multiple of the calculated annual savings may be due iowa west  the entity holding the pari mutuel and gaming license for the bluffs run casino in council bluffs  iowa  and with whom we have a management agreement to operate that property 
any additional payment that may be due to iowa west would increase goodwill related to our acquisition of harveys 
given the uncertainty of the tax rate situation in iowa see discussion in regional results and development plans  north central results  iowa  we cannot estimate the amount of this contingency 
effects of current economic and political conditions competitive pressures due to the limited number of new markets opening for development in recent years  many casino operators are reinvesting in existing markets to attract new customers  thereby increasing competition in those markets 
as companies have completed expansion projects  supply has typically grown at a faster pace than demand in some markets and competition has increased significantly 
furthermore  several operators  including harrah s  have announced plans for additional developments or expansions in some markets 
the louisiana legislature has authorized the use of slot machines at horse racing tracks in four parishes in louisiana 
we operate casinos in three of these markets 
in first quarter  a horse racing facility  located in one of those parishes where the use of slot machines has been authorized and near our property in lake charles  louisiana  opened with approximately  machines 
the horse racing facility is approximately twenty five miles closer to one of our major feeder markets than our property 
revenues and income from operations at our lake charles property have been negatively impacted by the addition of this new competitor 
in fourth quarter  we acquired a controlling interest in louisiana downs  a thoroughbred racetrack in bossier city  louisiana  which is in another of the parishes where the use of slot machines has been authorized and is located near our shreveport property 
in orleans parish  where harrah s new orleans is located  voters approved the use of slot machines at a racetrack in october in the third quarter of  the state of louisiana selected a competitor to receive the fifteenth and final riverboat gaming license to be issued by the state  under the legislation legalizing riverboat gaming in that state 
the competitor s project is for a riverboat casino in lake charles 
construction of that facility began in september  and it is anticipated to open in early we believe that the new riverboat competition in the lake charles area will have a negative impact on our operations there 
in atlantic city  a competitor opened a  room hotel and casino in july a competitor in missouri completed a large casino expansion in third quarter that is located near our st 
louis property  a competitor in the joliet market completed a new barge facility in second quarter and another competitor in the chicagoland market replaced its boats with barges in second quarter in the kansas city market  a competitor opened its expanded facility in third quarter and another competitor opened its new barge facility in fourth quarter the short term impact of increased competition in these markets has been negative 
in illinois  we are bidding on the final gaming license to be issued by the state and  if we are not successful and a competitor location is chosen  it could have an impact on our chicagoland operations 
a competitor is scheduled to open a new property in las vegas in  which could impact our properties there 
in october  the legislature of the state of new york approved a bill authorizing six new tribal casinos in that state and video lottery terminals at tracks 
the measure allows the governor of new york to negotiate gaming compacts with american indian tribes to operate three casinos in the catskills and three casinos in western new york 
in september  the state of california and approximately indian tribes executed class iii gaming compacts  which other california tribes can join 
the compacts will allow each tribe to operate  on tribal trust lands  two casinos with up to  slot machines per tribe and unlimited house banked card games 
our own agreements with rincon are a result of these events see regional results and development plans  managed casinos and other 
other states are also considering legislation enabling the development and operation of casinos or casino like operations 
although the short term effect of such competitive developments on our company generally has been negative  we are not able to determine the long term impact  whether favorable or unfavorable  that these trends and events will have on current or future markets 
we believe that the geographic diversity of our operations  our focus on multi market customer relationships  our service training  our rewards and customer loyalty programs  and our continuing efforts to establish our brands as premier brands upon which we have built strong customer loyalty have well positioned us to face the challenges present within our industry 
we utilize the capabilities of winet  a sophisticated nationwide customer database  and total rewards  a nationwide loyalty program that allows our customers to earn cash  comps and other benefits for playing at harrah s entertainment casinos 
we believe these sophisticated marketing tools provide us with competitive advantages  particularly with players who visit more than one market 
political uncertainties the casino entertainment industry is subject to political and regulatory uncertainty 
from time to time  individual jurisdictions have also considered legislation or referendums  which could adversely impact our operations 
the likelihood or outcome of similar legislation and referendums in the future cannot be predicted 
the casino entertainment industry represents a significant source of tax revenues to the various jurisdictions in which casinos operate 
from time to time  various state and federal legislators and officials have proposed changes in tax laws  or in the administration of such laws  which would affect the industry 
it is not possible to determine the scope or likelihood of possible future changes in tax laws or in the administration of such laws 
if adopted  such changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
economic conditions historically  economic conditions have had little effect on our operations  but we believe that adverse economic conditions did have some impact on our operating results and could affect future results 
we feel that our marketing programs  use of our technology to change the mix of slot machines and table games and our cost management programs have helped offset the impact of the sluggish economy 
national defense and homeland security matters the september   terrorist attacks  the potential for future terrorist attacks  the national and international responses to terrorist attacks and other acts of war or hostility have created many economic and political uncertainties  which could adversely affect our business and results of operations in ways that cannot presently be predicted 
for example  the united states coast guard is considering regulations designed to increase homeland security  which  if passed  could affect some of our properties and require significant expenditures to bring such properties into compliance 
furthermore  given current conditions in the global insurance markets  we are predominantly uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts and acts of war 
significant accounting policies and estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
certain of our accounting policies  including the estimated lives assigned to our assets  the determination of bad debt  asset impairment  fair value of guarantees and self insurance reserves  the purchase price allocations made in connection with our acquisitions and the calculation of our income tax liabilities  require that we apply significant judgment in defining the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
our judgments are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  our observance of trends in the industry  information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from our estimates 
the policies and estimates discussed below are considered by management to be those in which our policies  estimates and judgments have a significant impact on issues that are inherently uncertain 
property and equipment we have significant capital invested in our property and equipment  which represents approximately of our total assets 
judgments are made in determining the estimated useful lives of assets  salvage values to be assigned to assets and if or when an asset has been impaired 
the accuracy of these estimates affects the amount of depreciation expense recognized in our financial results and whether we have a gain or loss on the disposal of the asset 
we assign lives to our assets based on our standard policy  which is established by management as representative of the useful life of each category of asset 
we review the carrying value of our property and equipment whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition 
the factors considered by management in performing this assessment include current operating results  trends and prospects  as well as the effect of obsolescence  demand  competition and other economic factors 
in estimating expected future cash flows for determining whether an asset is impaired  assets are grouped at the operating unit level  which for most of our assets is the individual casino 
goodwill and other intangible assets we have approximately billion in goodwill and other intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheet resulting from our acquisition of other businesses 
an accounting standard adopted in requires an annual review of goodwill and other nonamortizing intangible assets for impairment 
we completed our initial assessment for impairment of goodwill and other nonamortizing intangible assets and recorded an impairment charge in first quarter we complete our annual assessment for impairment in fourth quarter each year  and in fourth quarter  we determined that  except for the goodwill associated with harrah s reno  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives have not been impaired 
a charge was recorded in fourth quarter for the impairment of reno s remaining goodwill 
the annual evaluation of goodwill and other nonamortizing intangible assets requires the use of estimates about future operating results of each reporting unit to determine their estimated fair value 
changes in forecasted operations can materially affect these estimates 
once an impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets has been recorded  it cannot be reversed 
total rewards point liability program our customer rewards program  total rewards  offers incentives to customers who gamble at our casinos throughout the united states 
prior to  customers received cash back and other offers made in the form of coupons that were mailed to the customer and were redeemable on a subsequent visit to one of our properties 
the coupons generally expired days after they were issued 
given the requirement of a return visit to redeem the offer and the short term expiration date  with no ability to renew or extend the offer  we recognized the expense of these offers when the coupons were redeemed 
in fourth quarter  a decision was made to change our total rewards program in to give our customers greater flexibility and control over the rewards they receive for playing at our casinos 
under the new program  customers are able to accumulate  or bank  reward credits over time that they may redeem at their discretion under the terms of the program 
the reward credit balance will be forfeited if the customer does not earn a reward credit over the prior six month period 
as a result of the ability of the customer to bank the reward credits under the revised program  our accounting for the total rewards program changed and we accrue the expense of reward credits  after consideration of estimated breakage  as they are earned 
to implement this change in the program  an initial bank of reward credits was offered to our existing customers 
the amount of credits offered for this initial bank was calculated based upon tracked play at our casinos 
as a result of the decision to extend this initial offer  an accrual of million was recorded in to recognize our estimate of the expense of this implementation offer 
under the current program  the value of the cost to provide reward credits is expensed as the reward credits are earned 
to arrive at the estimated cost associated with reward credits  estimates and assumptions are made regarding incremental marginal costs of the benefits  breakage rates and the mix of goods and services for which reward credits will be redeemed 
we use historical data to assist in the determination of estimated accruals 
at december   million was accrued for the cost of anticipated total rewards credit redemptions 
bad debt reserves we reserve an estimated amount for receivables that may not be collected 
methodologies for estimating bad debt reserves range from specific reserves to various percentages applied to aged receivables 
historical collection rates are considered  as are customer relationships  in determining specific reserves 
at december   we had million in our bad debt reserve 
as with many estimates  management must make judgments about potential actions by third parties in establishing and evaluating our reserves for bad debts 
self insurance accruals we are self insured up to certain limits for costs associated with general liability  workers compensation and employee health coverage 
insurance claims and reserves include accruals of estimated settlements for known claims  as well as accruals of actuarial estimates of incurred but not reported claims 
at december   we had total self insurance accruals reflected on our consolidated balance sheet of million 
in estimating these costs  we consider historical loss experience and make judgments about the expected levels of costs per claim 
we also rely on independent consultants to assist in the determination of estimated accruals 
these claims are accounted for based on actuarial estimates of the undiscounted claims  including those claims incurred but not reported 
we believe the use of actuarial methods to account for these liabilities provides a consistent and effective way to measure these highly judgmental accruals  however  changes in health care costs  accident frequency and severity and other factors can materially affect the estimate for these liabilities 
we continually monitor the potential for changes in estimates  evaluate our insurance accruals and adjust our recorded provisions 
recently issued and proposed accounting standards the following are accounting standards adopted or issued in that are applicable to our company 
during second quarter  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
establishes accounting standards for the recognition and measurement of an asset retirement obligation and its associated asset retirement cost

the additional guidance explains how to identify variable interest entities and how an enterprise should assess its interest in an entity to decide whether to consolidate that entity 
application of revised fin is required for public companies with interests in special purpose entities for periods ending after december  application for public entities for all other types of entities is required in financial statements for periods ending after march  we do not expect fin to have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial position

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to market risk  primarily changes in interest rates 
we attempt to limit our exposure to interest rate risk by managing the mix of our debt between fixed rate and variable rate obligations 
of our approximate billion total debt at december   billion  including the fixed rate debt for which we have entered into interest rate swap agreements  is subject to variable interest rates 
the average interest rate on our variable rate debt  excluding the impact of our swap agreements  was at december  assuming a constant outstanding balance for our variable rate debt for the next twelve months  a hypothetical change in interest rates would change interest expense for the next twelve months by approximately million 
we utilize interest rate swaps to manage the mix of our debt between fixed and variable rate instruments 
we do not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
the table below provides information as of december   about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  including debt obligations and interest rate swaps 
for debt obligations  the table presents notional amounts and weighted average interest rates by contractual maturity dates 
for interest rate swaps  the table presents notional amounts and weighted average interest rates by contractual maturity dates 
notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contract and weighted average variable rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve as of december  in millions thereafter total fair value liabilities long term debt fixed rate  average interest rate variable rate average interest rate interest rate derivatives interest rate swaps fixed to variable average pay rate average receive rate the fair values are based on the borrowing rates currently available for debt instruments with similar terms and maturities and market quotes of the company s publicly traded debt 
our long term variable rate debt reflects borrowings under revolving credit and letter of credit facilities provided to us by a consortium of banks with a total capacity of billion 
the interest rates charged on borrowings under these facilities are a function of the london inter bank offered rate  or libor and prime rate 
as such  the interest rates charged to us for borrowings under the facilities are subject to change as libor changes 
foreign currency translation gains and losses were not material to our results of operations for the year ended december  we sold our management contract for a casino in a foreign country in january although we are pursuing development opportunities in the united kingdom  we currently have no material ownership interests in businesses in foreign countries 
accordingly  we are not currently subject to material foreign currency exchange rate risk from the effects that exchange rate movements of foreign currencies would have on our future operating results or cash flows
