affordable housing represents properties subject to hud regulations 
overall  the loss from continuing operations increased million when comparing to and increased million when comparing to the decrease in total revenues was primarily the result of a decrease in reimbursements received from managed properties in both and when comparing each to the previous year 
these reimbursements  which are primarily payroll related  are included in direct property management expense in the same amounts as they are in revenues 
therefore  the decrease from year to year had the same effect on both total revenues and total expenses 
after removing this effect  total revenues decreased  in compared to and million in compared to the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in property and asset management fees received  offset by an increase in painting service revenues 
the decrease was primarily due to decreases in rental revenues and property and asset management fees received 
total expenses  after removal of the effect of reimbursements  increased million in compared to and  in compared to the increase was primarily due to increased property operating and maintenance expenses  which are partially offset by decreased direct property management expenses 
the increase was also primarily a result of increased property operating and maintenance expenses  which were partially offset by decreases in interest expense

rental revenue collections are impacted by a combination of rental rates  rent concessions and occupancy levels 
the company measures these factors using indicators such as average economic occupancy potential rent less vacancies and allowances divided by potential rent  physical occupancy number of units occupied divided by total number of units  and net collected rent per unit gross potential rents less vacancies and allowances divided by total number of units 
this information is presented in the following table for the years ended december   and for the year ended december  average economic physical net collected occupancy occupancy rent per unit acquisitions dispositions market rate affordable housing for the year ended december  average economic physical net collected occupancy occupancy rent per unit acquisitions dispositions market rate affordable housing for the year ended december  average economic physical net collected occupancy occupancy rent per unit acquisitions dispositions n a n a n a market rate affordable housing for the market rate properties  the company focused on increasing physical occupancy rates in this was accomplished by reducing rents in certain markets to remain competitive and reflect current market rents  resulting in an average rent charged per unit of in compared to in  and by additional concessions 
this resulted in slightly lower rental revenue in compared to the achievement of the occupancy goal has positioned the company to focus on maintaining rent at current levels or potentially increasing where possible without negatively impacting occupancy during the combination of increased occupancy  reduced concessions and maintained or increased rental rates is expected to result in increased net collected rent in rental revenue decreased million in compared to primarily as a result of increased concessions given and decreased occupancy rates during compared to rental revenues for the affordable housing properties increased  in compared to primarily as a result of four properties receiving hud approved rent increases during this was partially offset by a decrease in occupancy rates 
rental revenue for this segment decreased approximately  when comparing to these revenues are primarily dependent upon the company being entitled to receive rental assistance subsidies from hud via monthly housing assistance payments hap payments 
the amount of each monthly hap payment is equal to the rent amount the contract rent stated in the hap contract with hud  less the amount payable by the eligible resident for such month 
below is a table setting forth the expiration dates of the hap contracts and the hap revenue recognized for the company s affordable housing properties as of december  in thousands final revenue recognized during property expiration date ellet development december hillwood i july lakeshore village joint venture a january puritas place september st 
james riverview november shaker park gardens ii june state road apartments december statesman ii november sutliff apartments ii november tallmadge acres march twinsburg apartments june village towers november west high apartments november a amounts shown represents payment 
all thirteen properties shown in the above table had positive cash flow during and are anticipated to have positive cash flow for the remaining contract terms 
therefore  none of the hap contracts are considered to be loss contracts 
contract rents may be adjusted at least annually in accordance with the annual adjustment factor method for some of the properties 
generally  these types of adjustments are only permitted if current rents are below the hud published fair market rent fmr threshold 
if current rents exceed fmrs  a rent comparability study must be completed to demonstrate that the property s rents are below market 
prior to hap contract expiration  contract renewal request forms must be submitted by the company days prior to the hap anniversary date to hud or its corresponding contract agent in order to renew the existing hap contract 
current options available to the company for the expiring hap contracts are as follows i renew at current rents plus an operating cost adjustment factor ocaf that is set by hud on an annual basis 
these rents are below the market comparisons for properties that have a mortgage  ii renew at current rents plus an operating cost adjustment factor for properties without a mortgage  or  iii opt out of the section program 
opting out of the section program requires an additional one year notice to hud or the contract agent and the affected residents 
the company believes  that upon expiration of the contracts  the contracts will be renewed  or the company will enter into another government subsidized or mortgage restructuring program  or that the properties will be operated as conventional  market rate properties 
the following represents the company s current expectations concerning those hap contracts which expire in lakeshore village 
on october   the company requested a referral to the office of multifamily housing assistance restructuring omhar for the full restructuring of the mortgage and reduction of section rents to comparable market rents  and to renew the hap contract 
on february   the partnership was notified by hud that the property is eligible for the full restructuring of the mortgage and that the property was assigned to a participating administrative entity for further processing 
the current hap contract was extended by omhar through january  to allow for the closing of the mortgage restructuring deal  which is scheduled for march  the corresponding renewed hap contract will be at reduced rents retroactive to february  in the event that the partnership and hud fail to reach an agreement on the restructuring application  the current contract rents most likely would be reduced to market rents without a decrease in debt service 
the company anticipates that the contract will be renewed and that any reduction of rents to current market rents would be partially offset by a reduction in debt service payments 
currently  the estimated new market rents for the property are approximately  while the current annual contract rents are approximately  a difference of  this property is a joint venture property in which the company has a investment accounted for using the equity method 
therefore  a reduction in rents  without a corresponding reduction in debt service payments  would decrease net income to the company by approximately  this reduction would be reflected in the consolidated statements of operations in the line equity in net loss income of joint ventures

recent accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
consolidation of variable interest entities 
in december  the fasb issued a revision of interpretation no 
which superceded the january issuance 
this interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities in which the equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties or in which the equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest 
this interpretation requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
the interpretation also requires disclosures about variable interest entities that the company is not required to consolidate  but in which it has a significant variable interest 
the consolidation requirements of this interpretation apply immediately to variable interest entities created after january  and for financial statements for periods ending after march  to existing variable interest entities 
the company has substantially completed the evaluation of all of its legal entities in order to determine whether the entities are variable interest entities and whether the company is considered to be the primary beneficiary or whether it holds a significant variable interest 
the company has determined that certain legal entities  which are currently included in the company s consolidated financial statements  are variable interest entities 
the company is the primary beneficiary of these entities and therefore will continue to include them in its consolidated financial statements 
the company currently believes that the impact of adopting the provisions of this interpretation will have no material effect to the company s consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity the statement 
this statement establishes standards for the classification and measurement in a statement of financial position of certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it requires a financial instrument that is within its scope be classified as a liability or an asset in some circumstances because that financial instrument embodies an obligation of the company 
this statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise shall be effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june   excluding certain mandatorily redeemable non controlling interests  for which the classification and measurement provisions of the statement has been deferred indefinitely pursuant to fasb staff position the company has determined that currently it has no instruments that are within the scope of this statement 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at december   the company had million of variable rate debt 
additionally  the company has interest rate risk associated with fixed rate debt at maturity 
management has and will continue to manage interest rate risk as follows i maintain a conservative ratio of fixed rate  long term debt to total debt such that variable rate exposure is kept at an acceptable level  ii consider hedges for certain long term variable and or fixed rate debt through the use of interest rate swaps or interest rate caps  and iii use treasury locks where appropriate to hedge rates on anticipated debt transactions 
management uses various financial models and advisors to assist them in analyzing opportunities to achieve those objectives 
from time to time  the company may enter into hedge agreements to minimize its exposure to interest rate risks 
in april and may  the company completed two interest rate swaps 
the notional amounts of the swaps are approximately million 
these swaps were executed to hedge the fair market value of certain fixed rate loans 
both swaps terminate at the maturity of the related loans  that is  october for the million swap and august for the million swap 
for the year ended december   the company recognized a reduction to interest expense of  with respect to these two swaps 
the table below provides information about the company s financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
for debt obligations  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates

sensitivity analysis 
at december  and  the company estimates that a basis point decrease in market interest rates would have changed the fair value of fixed rate debt to a liability of million and million  respectively 
the sensitivity to changes in interest rates of the company s fixed rate debt was determined with a valuation model based upon changes that measure the net present value of such obligation which arise from the hypothetical estimate as discussed above 
contingencies environmental 
there are no recorded amounts resulting from environmental liabilities and there are no known material contingencies with respect thereto 
future claims for environmental liabilities are not measurable given the uncertainties surrounding whether there exists a basis for any such claims to be asserted and  if so  whether any claims will  in fact  be asserted 
furthermore  no condition is known to exist that would give rise to a material liability for site restoration  post closure and monitoring commitments  or other costs that may be incurred with respect to the sale or disposal of a property 
phase i environmental audits were obtained at the time of the ipo  property acquisition  or property refinancing  as the case may be  on all of the company s wholly owned and joint venture properties
