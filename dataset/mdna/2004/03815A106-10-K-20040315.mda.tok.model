please see risk factors in item business above for a discussion of the uncertainties  risks and assumptions associated with these statements 
applica is a marketer  distributor and manufacturer of a broad range of branded and private label small electric consumer goods 
applica markets  distributes and manufactures kitchen products  home products  pest control products  pet care products and personal care products 
applica markets products under licensed brand names  such as black decker  its own brand names  such as windmere  littermaid and applica  and other private label brand names 
applica s customers include mass merchandisers  specialty retailers and appliance distributors primarily in north america  latin america and the caribbean 
we operate manufacturing facilities in china and mexico 
in and  approximately and  respectively  of the products sold by applica were manufactured in such facilities 
in addition  we manufacture products for other consumer products companies  which we refer to as contract manufacturing 
management is currently focused on restructuring our manufacturing facilities to focus on more innovative  proprietary products 
we are outsourcing more commodity type products to strategic sourcing partners in china  which will significantly decrease the percentage of products manufactured at our own facilities 
in the fourth quarter of  applica entered into a joint product development relationship with the procter gamble company to develop  manufacture  market and distribute new products 
we have entered into agreements related to two products and are in the process of reviewing other opportunities for joint product development with procter gamble in household appliance categories 
this relationship has initially been targeted to the black decker brand  but may be expanded to new brands and wider categories 
we anticipate that the first new products developed will be launched in the second quarter of in june  applica made a million investment representing a interest in anasazi partners lp in the fourth quarter of  anasazi engaged an investment banker to pursue exit strategies for its equity investment in zoneperfect nutrition company 
in july  the zoneperfect nutrition company was sold for approximately million in cash  million of which is being held in escrow at december  in august  applica received a cash distribution from anasazi of million related to the sale  which reduced applica s investment in anasazi 
in the second half of  the general partner of anasazi partners lp began the process of liquidating the remaining partnership investments and dissolving the partnership  which is expected to be completed in the first quarter of during  we purchased million of our notes 
as of december   the outstanding balance was million 
in february  we purchased an additional million of the notes 
in september  a bipartisan group of us senators introduced legislation that would impose a duty on all imports from china until china stopped fixing the value of its currency  the renminbi  to the dollar 
the legislation maintains that the renminbi is artificially pegged below its market value and therefore acts as a virtual trade barrier 
since  china has pegged the renminbi at an exchange rate of to the dollar 
us groups have argued that the peg makes china s exports to the us cheaper  and us exports to china more expensive  thus greatly contributing to china s trade surplus with the us a house version of the bill was recently introduced 
action has not been completed on either bill 
we do not believe the legislation will be adopted in its current form 
however  because a substantial number of our products are imported from china  the adoption of such legislation in its current or a similar form would have a material adverse effect on our business 
in response to the proposal of such legislation  there is renewed activity within the chinese government regarding the relationship between the renminbi  the hong kong dollar and the us dollar 
if these currencies are allowed to float freely  it could result in significant fluctuations in our product costs 
in may  applica acquired weitech  inc for a total of million  including cash and notes 
weitech s business involved the design  manufacturer and distribution of pest control products that emit high 
table of contents frequency sound waves 
the results of operations of weitech  inc were included in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations from the date of the acquisition 
outlook we intend to update this outlook section in our quarterly reports on form q subsequently filed with the sec  however  applica disclaims any intention or obligation to publicly announce the results of any revisions to any of the forward looking statements contained herein to reflect future events or developments 
management anticipates that sales for the year ended december  will be between million and million 
earnings per diluted share for is expected to be between and 
the increased sales volume is expected to result from the introduction of the home caf single cup brewing system and the tide buzz ultrasonic stain removal system both of which were co developed with the procter gamble company  as well as increases in sales of other new black decker branded products 
management expects gross margins to expand in as a result of the cost reduction and retrenchment work undertaken in and a greater proportion of higher margin  new products to be launched in management anticipates that gross margins will be approximately in management expects that selling  general and administrative operating expenses will increase in amount in  but remain at approximately of sales 
variable cost categories will increase because of higher sales volume 
additionally  minimum royalties on the black and decker branded products will increase to million in from million in management is planning to increase advertising and promotional spending by million 
these expenses will be partially offset by a decrease of approximately million in amortization expense 
management anticipates that interest expense will continue to decrease to approximately million for capital expenditures are planned to be approximately million  driven by new products and the information technology initiative 
management expects that capital expenditures for our manufacturing operations will decrease in for the quarter ended march   we believe that sales will be between million and million and there will be a loss per share of to 
management will continue to downsize both the mexican and chinese manufacturing facilities and expects to incur up to an additional million in severance costs and non cash asset write offs in the first quarter of  which did not qualify for accrual at december  use of estimates and critical accounting policies applica s accounting policies are more fully described in note a of notes to consolidated financial statements included in schedule i hereto 
as disclosed in note a  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates  and such differences may be material to the financial statements 
applica believes that of its critical accounting policies  the following had a significant effect on the operations for and applica performs goodwill impairment tests on at least an annual basis and more frequently in certain circumstances 
applica cannot predict the occurrence of certain events that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill that totaled million at december  and for example  such events may include strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions  the impact of the economic environment on applica s customer base  or a material negative change in its relationships with significant customers 
if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of goodwill below its carrying amount  goodwill will be tested for impairment 
applica will recognize an impairment loss if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the fair value determination 
during the first quarter of  applica recorded a 
table of contents write down of its goodwill of million million  net of tax 
applica performed its annual fair value assessment as of june  and no impairment was noted 
as the result of lower than expected sales of certain core categories of black decker branded products in the third and fourth quarters of  applica also performed a fair value test as of december  however  no impairment was noted 
applica reviews long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles held and used for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in evaluating the fair value and future benefits of its intangible assets  management performs an analysis of the anticipated undiscounted future net cash flows of the individual assets over the remaining amortization period 
applica recognizes an impairment loss if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the expected future cash flows 
during  in connection with an intangible asset related to the black decker trademark  management determined that a triggering event had occurred in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
applica performed a benefit analysis by calculating the expected effective royalty rate in through  taking into account the minimum royalties  as well as the projected sales of black and decker branded products 
based on the benefit analysis  applica recorded an impairment charge of million to write off the unamortized book value of the intangible asset 
applica is also subject to income tax laws in many countries 
judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in applica s financial statements or tax returns 
significant management judgment is required in developing applica s provision for income taxes  including the determination of foreign tax liabilities  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances that might be required to be applied against the deferred tax assets 
at december   applica had deferred tax assets in excess of deferred tax liabilities of million 
applica determined that it was more likely than not that million of such assets will be realized  resulting in a valuation allowance of million as of december  applica evaluates its ability to realize its deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis and adjusts the amount of its valuation allowance  if necessary 
applica operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in those jurisdictions 
because of the complex issues involved  any claims can require an extended period to resolve 
in management s opinion  adequate provisions for income taxes have been made 
during  applica expects that taxing authorities may complete tax audits currently underway 
the final outcome of these future tax consequences  tax audits  and changes in regulatory tax laws and rates could materially impact applica s financial statements 
applica records allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments on their balances 
we assess the credit worthiness of our customers based on multiple sources of information and analyze such factors as our historical bad debt experiences  publicly available information regarding our customers and the inherent credit risk related to them  information from subscription based credit reporting companies  trade association data and reports  current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms or payment patterns 
this assessment requires significant judgment 
if the financial condition of our customers were to worsen  additional write offs may be required  resulting in write offs that are not included in the allowance for doubtful accounts at december  applica is subject to various legal proceedings  product liability claims and other claims in the ordinary course of its business 
during  applica had an increase of million in legal expenses  which were primarily associated with the tilia related litigation matters 
with respect to product liability  applica estimates the amount of ultimate liability in excess of applicable insurance coverage based on historical claims experience and current claim amounts  as well as other available facts and circumstances 
we believe that the amount of ultimate liability of our current litigation matters  if any  is not likely to have a material effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
however  as the outcome of litigation is difficult to predict  significant changes in the estimated exposures could occur 
estimates in connection with specific events have a significant effect on accruals for  among others  the consolidation of operations  plant closings  reduction in employees and product recalls 
estimates have also been required with respect to our investment in a joint venture investment partnership  anasazi partners  lp applica makes a number of other estimates in the ordinary course of business relating to sales returns and allowances  warranty accruals  and accruals for promotional incentives 
historically  changes to these estimates have not had a material impact on our financial condition but have significantly affected operations from time to time 
however  circumstances could change which may alter future expectations

gross profit 
applica s gross profit decreased by million to million in as the result of lower sales volume and lower gross profit margins 
applica s gross profit margin decreased to for the year ended december  as compared to for the gross profit margin decrease was primarily attributed to unabsorbed overhead at our factories related to lower production levels  million in manufacturing retrenchment costs incurred in the fourth quarter of  and a poor product mix 
these decreases were partially offset by the reversal of million related to the product recall accrual

see item legal proceedings above 
effect of inflation our results of operations for the periods discussed have not been significantly affected by inflation 
currency matters while we transact business predominantly in us dollars and most of our revenues are collected in us dollars  a substantial portion of our costs  such as payroll  rent and indirect operational costs  are denominated in other currencies  such as chinese renminbi  hong kong dollars and mexican pesos 
in addition  while a small portion of our revenues are collected in foreign currencies  such as canadian dollars  argentine pesos  colombian pesos  chilean pesos and venezuelan bolivars  a significant portion of the related cost of goods sold are denominated in us dollars 
changes in the relation of these and other currencies to the us dollar will affect our cost of goods sold and operating margins and could result in exchange losses 
the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations cannot be accurately predicted 
the dollar foreign exchange rates may not be stable in the future and fluctuations in financial markets may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
from time to time  applica uses forward exchange and option contracts to reduce fluctuations in foreign currency cash flows related to third party raw materials and other operating purchases  as well as trade receivables 
the purpose of applica s foreign currency management activity is to reduce the risk that anticipated cash flows and earnings from foreign currency denominated transactions may be affected by changes in exchange rates 
currently  there is renewed activity within the chinese government regarding the relationship between the renminbi  the hong kong dollar and the us dollar 
if these currencies are allowed to float freely  it could result in significant fluctuations in our product costs  which would have a material impact on our business

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk applica is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations 
in the normal course of business  we employ established policies and procedures to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates and foreign currencies using a variety of financial instruments 
interest rate sensitivity 
our primary market risk exposure with respect to interest rates is changes in short and long term interest rates in the united states 
certain of applica s debt arrangements represent floating rate debt and accordingly  we are subject to interest rate risk 
applica uses interest rate risk management contracts to manage our fixed to floating ratio  which may reduce the impact of changes in interest rates on our floating rate debt 
our objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  we primarily use interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes related to applica s portfolio of borrowings 
applica maintains fixed rate debt as a percentage of its net debt between a minimum and maximum percentage  which is set by policy 
the tables below provides information regarding applica s derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  including interest rate swaps and debt obligations 
for debt obligations  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
for interest rate swaps  the table presents notional amounts and weighted average interest rates by contractual maturity dates 
notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual payments expected to be exchanged under the contract 
weighted average variable rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at the reporting date 
at december  expected maturity date there fair after total value dollars in thousands liabilities long term debt fixed rate average interest rate variable rate average interest rate interest rate contracts interest rate swaps pay fixed average pay rate average receive rate pay floating average pay rate average receive rate calculated as the weighted average of on the million notes payable relating to the weitech  inc acquisition and on the mortgage loan on the property located in miami lakes  florida 
the variable rate revolving credit facility is set depending upon the interest period elected by applica one  two  three or six months at a rate equivalent to the libor rate plus an applicable margin based upon applica s leverage ratio as of december  or at a rate equivalent to the prime rate plus an applicable margin based upon applica s leverage ratio as of december  
at december   applica had two interest rate swap contracts to pay a fixed rate of interest and and receive a variable rate of interest of three month libor that mature on december  the libor used to calculate the average receive rate is based upon the forward yield curve as of december  
table of contents at december   applica had an interest rate swap contract to pay a variable rate of interest of six month libor in arrears plus and receive a fixed rate of interest of that matures on july  the libor used to calculate the average pay rate is based upon the forward yield curve as of december  fair values were determined based on broker quotes or quoted market prices or rates for the same or similar instruments

exchange rate sensitivity 
our primary market risk exposure with respect to exchange rates is to changes in us dollar mexican peso  us dollar chinese renminbi  us dollar hong kong dollar and us dollar canadian dollar exchange rates 
in addition  we also have exposure to the argentinean peso  colombian peso  chilean peso and venezuelan bolivar 
certain forecasted transactions could expose applica to foreign currency risk 
we purchase 
table of contents currency forwards and options as cash flow hedges of foreign currency forecasted transactions related to the purchase of third party raw materials and other operating expenses 
our objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility in order to allow management to focus on core business issues and challenges 
accordingly  we enter into various contracts that change in value as foreign exchange rates change to protect the value of our existing foreign currency assets  liabilities  commitments and forecasted foreign currency revenues and expenses 
applica uses option strategies and forward contracts that provide for the sale and or purchase of foreign currencies to hedge probable  but not firmly committed  expenditures 
the principal currencies hedged are the mexican peso  chinese renminbi  hong kong dollar and canadian dollar 
by policy  applica maintains hedge coverage between minimum and maximum percentages of its forecasted foreign exchange exposures for periods not to exceed eighteen months 
the gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the value of the related exposures 
as discussed above  we are exposed to market risks arising from changes in foreign exchange rates 
as of december   applica hedged a portion of its estimated foreign currency transactions using forward exchange contracts and purchased options 
we use a sensitivity model to determine a potential change in the fair value of our foreign exchange financial instruments 
the sensitivity model estimates the change in fair value based upon a favorable and unfavorable movement of in the respective spot rate 
the sensitivity model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses or gains in fair value that will be incurred by applica 
it should also be noted that the change in value represents the estimated change in the fair market value of the derivative 
because the derivatives hedge an underlying exposure  there would be a comparable and opposite change in value of the underlying exposure 
the estimated potential change in fair value  calculated using the sensitivity model  is as follows at december  change in fair value due to notional hedge favorable unfavorable amount in us dollars movement in spot movement in spot dollars in thousands mexican peso canadian dollar chilean peso colombian peso total change in fair value it is our policy to enter into foreign currency and interest rate transactions and other financial instruments only to the extent considered necessary to meet our objectives as stated above 
we do not enter into these transactions for speculative purposes
