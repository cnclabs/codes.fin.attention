item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations factors that may affect future results we are dependent on limited and sole source suppliers for electronic components and may experience component shortages  which would cause us to delay shipments to customers 
we attempt to mitigate the risks of component shortages by working with customers to delay delivery schedules or by working with suppliers to provide the needed components using just in time inventory programs 
competition the electronics manufacturing services industry is extremely competitive and includes hundreds of companies 
the contract manufacturing services we provide are available from many independent sources 
many of our competitors are more established in the industry and have substantially greater financial  manufacturing  or marketing resources than we do 
certain of our competitors have broader geographic presence than we do  including manufacturing facilities in asia  europe  and south america 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in our targeted market are quality  reliability  ability to meet delivery schedules  technological sophistication  geographic location  and price 
we also face competition from current and potential customers  which are continually evaluating the relative merits of internal manufacturing versus contract manufacturing for various products 
intellectual property we seek to protect our proprietary technology and other intangible assets primarily through trade secret protection 
in addition  we depend heavily on training  recruiting  and retaining our employees  who are required to have sufficient know how to operate advanced equipment and to conduct sensitive and complicated manufacturing processes 
governmental regulation our operations are subject to certain federal  state  and local regulatory requirements relating to environmental  waste management  and health and safety matters  and there can be no assurance that material costs and liabilities will not be incurred in complying with those regulations or that past or future operations will not result in exposure to injury or claims of injury by employees or the public 
to meet various legal requirements  we have modified our circuit board cleaning processes to utilize only aqueous water based methods 
some risk of liabilities related to these matters is inherent in our business  as with many similar businesses 
our management team believes that our business is operated in compliance with applicable environmental  waste management  and health and safety regulations  the violation of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
in the event of violation  these regulations provide for civil and criminal fines  injunctions  and other sanctions and  in certain instances  allow third parties to sue to enforce compliance 
in addition  new  modified  or more stringent requirements or enforcement policies could be adopted that may adversely affect our business 
we periodically generate and temporarily handle limited amounts of materials that are considered hazardous waste under applicable law 
we engage independent contractors for the off site disposal of these materials 
for additional information  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition 
table of contents and results of operations factors that may affect future results our failure to comply with the requirements of environmental laws could result in fines and revocation of permits necessary to our manufacturing processes 
employees as of march   we had  full time equivalent employees  including  that were engaged in manufacturing operations  in material handling and procurement  and in finance  sales  and administration 
as of the same date  we also engaged the full time services of temporary laborers through employment agencies 
none of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement 
our management team believes that the relationship with our employees is good

an ebitda based calculation is also used by our lenders in determining compliance with certain financial covenants

ebitda should not be construed as alternatives to net income loss  determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  as an indicator of operating performance  as a measure of liquidity or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap 
we believe the presentation of these additional financial performance indicators is beneficial to investors since they provide an additional perspective from which to evaluate our company 
however  in evaluating alternative measures of operating performance  it is important to understand that there are no standards for these calculations 
accordingly  the lack of standards can result in subjective determinations by management about which items may be excluded from the calculations  as well as the potential for inconsistencies between different companies that have similarly titled alternative measures 
for example  as discussed in greater detail under item of this report on form k  the calculation of ebitda in our amended credit agreement with citibank is different than the calculation of ebitda shown above

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes  and the other financial information included in this report 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those set forth in factors that may affect future results below and elsewhere in this report 
executive summary during  we reduced our operating loss to million compared to million in over the past three years  we have experienced a severe contraction in our business where annual sales have declined from million in to million in we responded to the economic downturn by closing five of our manufacturing facilities  which resulted in significant restructuring charges over the past three years 
these plant closures combined with other restructuring and cost containment initiatives implemented over the last three years  have resulted in a much lower cost structure that is in place at the end of despite our large operating loss in  we were able to generate million of positive operating cash flow because we were experiencing sequential quarterly reductions in our net sales in and that allowed us to reduce inventories and receivables 
this generated positive operating cash flows that more than offset the cash operating losses 
however  during our quarterly net sales remained relatively flat and we were not able to realize a similar cash flow benefit by reducing our inventories and receivables 
the resulting negative operating cash flows of million in  have decreased our unused borrowing availability from million at the end of to million at the end of this decline of million during was primarily attributable to increased borrowings to fund our operating loss  and an april amendment to our credit facility that temporarily removed an additional million of availability until operating performance improves to a level acceptable to the lender 
during we increased our bank debt by million primarily to fund our negative operating cash flow 
at the end of our bank debt had increased to million compared to million at the end of as we look forward to the first quarter of  we believe market conditions are improving in the electronics industry  especially in the semiconductor capital equipment sector where orders have increased significantly 
we believe it is critical that we achieve significantly improved financial results during the recovery since our current level of unused borrowing availability may not be adequate to fund additional operating losses along with increased working capital requirements associated with a substantial increase in net sales 
some of the tactical issues we are addressing include delaying inventory purchases to improve our cash cycle time and minimize incremental borrowings  monitoring production schedules to minimize overtime and materials expediting charges except for those cases where our customers agree to reimburse us to support their orders placed inside standard lead times  and to ensure that we fully realize the benefits of improved capacity utilization before adding incremental costs 
aggregate net sales generated from our two major customers declined from about million in to million in  as both of these customers were impacted by adverse industry conditions 
during  we replaced some of this business with orders from smaller  less credit worthy customers 
while losses due to credit risk have not been a significant percentage of our net sales  this trend may not continue in the future as we continue to diversify our major customer concentration with orders from smaller customers 
assuming that we are successful in eliminating our cash operating losses  we believe we have adequate capital resources to fund our planned operating activities for however  we do not have adequate capital resources to fund the purchase of any additional material business units and we would like to ensure that we have adequate capital resources to make strategic acquisitions that enhance our long term business prospects 
accordingly  we have commenced discussions with citibank and other lenders to replace our current credit facility  which expires in april our objective is to secure additional borrowing capacity and flexibility to make strategic acquisitions

factors that may affect future results this section includes an in depth discussion of many of the risks and uncertainties that affect our business and industry  as well as risks that should be considered before investing in our common stock 
our future financial results are dependent upon effectively managing and responding to these risks 
information about our business suntron corporation was formed as a holding company for the purpose of effecting the business combination of eftc corporation and k tec operating company  llc formerly known as thayer blum funding ii  llc and its wholly owned subsidiary  k tec electronics holding corporation referred to together as k tec 
the combination of eftc and k tec was completed on february  and  in connection with the combination  eftc and k tec each became a wholly owned subsidiary of suntron 
as a result of the combination  the former holder of membership interests in k tec received  shares of suntron common stock  and the former shareholders of eftc received 
shares of suntron common stock for each share of eftc common stock  or an aggregate of  shares 
the combination was accounted for as a reorganization of entities under common control 
accordingly  our financial statements have been retroactively adjusted to present the combined results of eftc since its inception and k tec since october  the date that common control was established 
suntron delivers complete manufacturing services and solutions to support the entire life cycle of complex products in the semiconductor capital equipment  aerospace and defense  medical and industrial markets 
our manufacturing services include printed circuit card assembly  cable and harness production  plastic injection molding  sheet metal  engineering services  quick turn manufacturing services and full systems integration  testing  and after market repair and warranty services 
we believe our success in the marketplace is a direct result of our ability to provide unique solutions tailored to match each of our customer s specific requirements  while meeting the highest quality standards in the industry 

table of contents as an electronic manufacturing services company  many of our customers are original equipment manufacturers  or oems  that have designed their own products 
our customers request proposals that include key terms such as quality  delivery  and the price to purchase the materials and perform the manufacturing services to make one or more components or assemblies 
generally  the component or assembly that we manufacture is delivered to the customer where it is then integrated into their final product 
we price new business with our customers by obtaining raw material quotes from our suppliers and then estimating the amount of labor and overhead that will be required to make the products 
before we begin a customer relationship  we typically enter into arrangements that are intended to protect us in case a customer cancels an order after we purchase the raw materials to fill that order 
in these circumstances  the customer is generally required to purchase the materials or reimburse us if we incur a loss from liquidating the raw materials 
the electronics manufacturing services industry is extremely dynamic and our customers make frequent changes to their orders 
the magnitude and frequency of these changes make it difficult to predict revenues beyond the next quarter  and even relatively short term forecasts may prove inaccurate depending on changes in economic  political  and military factors  as well as unexpected customer requests to delay shipments near the end of our fiscal quarters 
these changes in customer orders also cause substantial difficulties in managing inventories  which often leads to excess inventories and the need to recognize losses on inventories 
however  from time to time  we may also have difficulties obtaining certain electronic components that are in short supply  which can result in a decision to purchase some materials before formal notice of demand is received from our customer 
in addition  our inventories consist of over  different parts and many of these parts have limited alternative uses or markets beyond the products that we manufacture for our customers 
when we liquidate excess materials through an inventory broker or auction  we often realize less than the original cost of the materials  and in some cases we determine that there is no market for the excess materials 
the most common reasons we incur losses related to inventories are due to purchasing more materials than are necessary to meet a customer s requirements or failing to act promptly to minimize losses once the customer communicates a cancellation 
occasionally it is not clear what action caused an inventory loss and there is a shared responsibility whereby our customers agree to negotiate a settlement with us 
accordingly  management continually evaluates inventory on hand  forecasted demand  contractual protections  and net realizable values in order to determine whether an adjustment to the carrying amount of inventory is necessary 
when the relationship with a customer terminates  we tend to be more vulnerable to inventory losses because the customer may be reluctant to accept responsibility for the remaining inventory if a product is at the end of its life cycle 
we can also incur inventory losses if a customer becomes insolvent and the materials do not have alternative uses or markets into which we can sell them 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  property  plant and equipment  intangible assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  restructuring related obligations  and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
we cannot assure you that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we generally recognize revenue from manufacturing services and product sales upon shipment and transfer of title to the manufactured product  whereby our customers assume the risks and rewards of ownership of the product 
generally  there are no formal customer acceptance requirements or further obligations related to manufacturing services  however  if such requirements or obligations exist  then revenue is recognized at the point when the requirements are completed and the obligations fulfilled 
if uncertainties exist 
table of contents about whether the customer has assumed the risks and rewards of ownership or if continuing performance obligations exist  before revenue is recognized we generally expand our written communications with the customer to ensure that our understanding of the arrangement is consistent with that of the customer 
in limited circumstances  although the physical product remains in the company s facilities at the request of customers  revenue is recognized in accordance with the guidance in sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
revenue from design  engineering and other services is recognized as the services are performed 
write downs for obsolete and slow moving inventories 
our judgments about excess and obsolete inventories are especially difficult because i hundreds of different components may be associated with a single product we manufacture for a customer  ii we make numerous products for most of our customers  iii even though we are engaged in the electronic manufacturing services industry  most of our customers are engaged in diverse industries  iv a significant amount of the parts we purchase are unique to a particular customer s orders and there are limited alternative markets if that customer s order is canceled  and v all of our customers experience dynamic business environments affected by a wide variety of economic  political  and regulatory factors 
this complex environment results in positive and negative events that can change daily and which affect judgments about future demand for our manufacturing services and the amounts we can realize when it is not possible to liquidate inventories through production of finished products 
we frequently review customer demand to determine if we have excess raw materials that will not be consumed in production 
in determining demand we consider firm purchase orders and forecasts of demand submitted by our customers 
if we determine that excess inventories exist and that the customer is not contractually obligated for the excess inventories  we make judgments about whether unforecasted demand for those materials is likely to occur or the amount we would likely realize in the sale of this material through a broker or auction 
if we determine that future demand from the customer is unlikely  we write down our inventories to the extent that the cost of the inventory exceeds the estimated market value 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required in future periods 
likewise  if we underestimate contractual recoveries from customers or future demand  hindsight may indicate that we over reported our costs of goods sold in earlier periods  which results in the recognition of additional gross profit at the time the material is used in production and the related goods are sold 
therefore  although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or the outcome of customer negotiations with respect to the enforcement of contractual provisions could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
allowance for doubtful accounts receivable 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments  as well as to provide for adjustments related to pricing and quantity differences 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances would be required 
when our customers experience difficulty in paying us  we need to estimate how much of our receivable will not be collected 
these judgments are often difficult because the customer may not divulge complete and accurate information 
even if we are fully aware of the customer s financial condition it can be difficult to estimate the expected recovery and there is often a wide range of outcomes 
over the past year  we have diversified our concentration of business with our major customers and have added smaller customers that generally have higher credit risk 
accordingly  we may experience higher bad debt losses in the future 
impairment of long lived assets 
when we undergo changes in our business  including the closure or relocation of facilities  we often have equipment and other long lived assets that are no longer needed in continuing operations 
when this occurs  we are required to estimate future cash flows and if such cash flows are less than the carrying value of the assets or asset group  as applicable  we recognize impairment charges to reduce the carrying value to estimated fair value 
the determination of future cash flows and fair value tend to be highly subjective estimates 
when assets are held for sale and the actual market conditions deteriorate  or are less favorable than those projected by management  additional impairment charges may be required in subsequent periods 
effective january   we were required to adopt a new accounting standard that changed the method for evaluating impairment of goodwill 
the valuation of reporting units is a highly subjective process that can be influenced by a wide range of factors including historical and 
table of contents forecasted results for the reporting unit  interest rates  and political  regulatory  and economic conditions 
because of the volatility of these factors  a significant reduction in the value of a reporting unit may occur in a relatively short period of time  which could result in a material charge for impairment 
effective january   we implemented this new accounting standard and recognized an impairment charge of million related to the k tec reporting unit 
we are required to evaluate potential impairment of goodwill at least annually and  depending on changes in the fair value of reporting units at future testing dates  we may need to recognize additional impairment losses that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 
accrual of lease exit costs 
when we undertake restructuring activities and decide to close a plant that we occupy under a non cancelable operating lease  we are required to estimate how long it will take to locate a new tenant to sublease the facility and to estimate the rate that we are likely to receive when a tenant is located 
accordingly  we will incur additional lease exit charges in future periods if our estimates of the rate or timing of sublease payments turns out to be less favorable than our current expectations 
we also consider the estimated cost of building improvements  brokerage commissions  and any other costs we believe will be incurred in connection with the subleasing process 
the precise outcome of most of these factors is difficult to predict 
we review our estimates at least quarterly  including consultation with our commercial real estate advisors to assess changes in market conditions  feedback from parties that have expressed interest  and other information that we believe is relevant to most accurately reflect the expected outcome of obtaining a subtenant to lease the facility 
commercial real estate conditions are currently very poor in the areas in which we are attempting to sublease closed facilities  and we believe our estimates have appropriately considered these conditions 
as discussed under impact of recently issued accounting standards below  new accounting rules are effective for all restructuring activities initiated in for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in our audited consolidated financial statements referred to in item of this report 
overview of statement of operations net sales are recognized when title is transferred to our customers  which generally occurs upon shipment from our facilities 
net sales from design  engineering and other services is generally recognized as the services are performed 
our sales are recorded net of customer discounts taken or expected to be taken 
cost of goods sold includes materials  labor  and overhead expenses incurred in the manufacture of our products 
cost of goods sold also includes charges and credits related to manufacturing operations for lease exit costs  impairment of long lived assets  and obsolete and slow moving inventories 
many factors affect our gross margin  including capacity utilization  product mix  and production volume 
selling  general  and administrative expenses primarily include the salaries for executive  finance  accounting  and human resources personnel  salaries and commissions paid to our internal sales force and external sales representatives and marketing costs  insurance expenses  depreciation expense related to assets not used in manufacturing activities  and professional fees for auditing and legal assistance and general corporate expenses 
severance  retention  closure and relocation costs primarily related to costs associated with reductions in our administrative workforce 
severance  retention  relocation and closure costs that relate to manufacturing activities are included in cost of goods sold 
reorganization transaction costs consist of expenses incurred in connection with the business combination between eftc and k tec  which is described in note of our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
reorganization costs included a fairness opinion  professional fees and printing costs for the combination and related securities and exchange commission filings 
the business combination was accounted for as a reorganization of entities under common control  and  accordingly  these costs were charged to operations in the period when the costs were incurred 
related party fees include management fees and advisory fees paid to affiliates of our majority stockholder 
impairment of long lived assets reflects charges related to non manufacturing assets  impairment of manufacturing assets is included in cost of goods sold 
goodwill amortization expense includes the amortization of goodwill relating to the acquisition of current electronics  inc and the acquisition of k tec electronics holding corporation 
effective january  
table of contents  goodwill was no longer permitted to be amortized when statement of financial accounting standards no 
became effective 
interest expense relates to our senior credit facilities and other debt obligations 
interest expense also includes the amortization of debt issuance costs and unused commitment fees that are charged for the portion of our million credit facility that is not used from time to time 
results of operations our results of operations are affected by several factors  primarily the level and timing of customer orders especially orders from our major customers 
the level and timing of orders placed by a customer vary due to the customer s attempts to balance its inventory  changes in the customer s manufacturing strategy  and variation in demand for its products due to  among other things  product life cycles  competitive conditions  and general economic conditions 
in the past  changes in orders from customers have had a significant effect on our quarterly results of operations

net sales decreased million  or  from million in to million in this decrease in net sales was attributable to significant decreases in net sales across our customer base  including decreases with honeywell and applied materials of million and million  respectively 
the reduction in net sales to honeywell and applied materials was partially offset by approximately million of net sales to new customers and million of net sales related to the may  acquisition of the assets of trilogic 
we believe the primary reason for lower net sales to our major customers in was due to the economic downturn in the aerospace and semiconductor capital equipment industries 
net sales in and include approximately million and million  respectively  of excess inventories that were sold back to customers pursuant to contractual provisions of our customer agreements

gross profit loss 
our gross profit loss improved by million from a loss of million in to a loss of million in gross profit loss as a percentage of net sales improved from a loss of of net sales in to a loss of of net sales in in  we incurred restructuring costs of million  including million of accelerated depreciation due to shortened lives of leasehold improvements  million for lease exit costs primarily associated with the 
table of contents consolidation of operations in phoenix  and million for severance costs related to terminated employees 
in november  the company entered into an agreement with the landlord of the fremont facility whereby the company paid million as consideration for the early termination of the lease 
the company incurred additional costs of million related to the fremont lease in the fourth quarter of  resulting in a credit of million due to the extinguishment of the remaining liability 
this credit was reflected as a reduction of cost of goods sold since the loss relating to future lease exit costs of the vacated facility that was accrued in was charged to cost of goods sold 
the improvement in gross profit loss in is primarily attributable to the reduction in restructuring costs and benefits realized from other cost reduction initiatives that have been implemented 
however  despite our extensive restructuring and cost cutting achievements over the past two years  we have not been able to increase net sales to a level that would result in profitable operations 
in  we incurred a gross profit deficiency of million  primarily due to million of restructuring charges consisting of million for lease exit costs primarily associated with the closure of our fremont facility  million for impairment of a building and manufacturing equipment  and million for severance  retention and moving costs related to our manufacturing workforce

write downs of excess inventories are related to a variety of customers for which we do not expect to realize the carrying value through production or other means of liquidation 
through the first half of  we have a significant amount of equipment that will become fully depreciated  although many of these assets are still in service 
accordingly  our depreciation expense related to property  plant and equipment for is expected to decrease by approximately million from the million reported in approximately million of this benefit is expected to be reflected in lower selling  general  and administrative expenses and the remaining million is expected to result in a reduction of cost of goods sold 
selling  general  and administrative expenses 
selling  general  and administrative expenses sg a decreased million  or  from million in to million in the decrease in sg a during was primarily attributable to reductions in i compensation and benefits due to an approximately reduction in our administrative workforce  ii professional fees primarily due to lower legal and accounting services upon the complete integration of k tec by the end of  and iii information technology and facilities costs due to fewer employees and the closure of several facilities 
these decreases were partially offset by a charge of million that was required in the fourth quarter of when we reserved a significant portion of our receivable from a former customer that filed for bankruptcy protection in february 
table of contents aggregate net sales generated from our two major customers declined from about million in to million in  as both of these customers were impacted by adverse industry conditions 
during  we replaced some of this business with orders from smaller  less credit worthy customers 
while losses due to credit risk have not been a significant percentage of our net sales  this trend may not continue in the future as we continue to diversify our customer base 
interest expense 
interest expense increased million  or  from million in to million in  primarily due to an increase in our weighted average borrowings from million in to million in the impact of higher borrowings in was partially offset by a reduction in our weighted average interest rate computed without regard to amortization of debt issuance costs  which comprised approximately million of our interest cost in both and from in to in since our borrowings were higher in  we paid less for unused commitment fees under the revolving credit agreement  which also contributed to the lower effective interest rate in a portion of the purchase price for the october acquisition of k tec electronics holding corporation was subject to a dispute that was expected to be resolved through arbitration proceedings 
on may   the parties agreed to settle the dispute whereby the million principal balance of a note payable to the former owner was reduced by million  resulting in an adjusted principal balance of million 
in accounting for this settlement  the company reduced the carrying amount of goodwill by million and recognized a credit to operations of million for accrued interest that was previously expensed and that was no longer payable due to the settlement 
this note  which provided for interest at  was repaid in may year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
net sales decreased million  or  from million in to million in this decrease in net sales was primarily attributable to significant decreases in net sales across our customer base  including decreases with honeywell and emulex of million and million  respectively 
the decrease in net sales in was primarily attributable to significant downturns in the industries that our major customers are engaged in  including aerospace and networking equipment 
during  our net sales included million of excess inventories that were sold back to our customers pursuant to contractual provisions of our customer agreements

our gross profit decreased million from a loss of million in to a loss of million in similarly  gross profit as a percentage of net sales deteriorated from a loss of of net sales in to a loss of of net sales in  primarily due to million of restructuring charges  unfavorable changes in product mix  our inability to reduce fixed costs in proportion to the decline in net sales  and nominal gross margins associated with million of revenue from the sale of excess inventories in these adverse changes were partially offset by a million reduction in write downs resulting from excess and obsolete inventories during compared to during  we decided to close manufacturing facilities in ottawa  kansas and fremont  california  and we took other actions to reduce the size of our workforce 
these activities resulted in total charges to cost of goods sold of million 
the million charge consists of million for lease exit costs  million for impairment of a building and manufacturing equipment  and million for severance  retention  and moving costs 
the benefits of these restructuring activities are not expected to be fully realized until the first quarter of during  we assessed certain long lived assets for impairment related to the planned move to a new facility in the northeast  and the abandonment of manufacturing related software that is no longer expected to be used 
due to changes in our customers and product mix  we also assessed the carrying value of intellectual property and manufacturing equipment related to those customers during accordingly  we recognized an impairment expense of million that was included in cost of goods sold in during  we also recognized charges of million for severance costs related to workforce reductions and million for lease exit cost related to facility 
table of contents closures 
inventory write downs decreased million from million  or of net sales in to million  or of net sales  in this reduction in inventory write downs resulted primarily from our substantial efforts over the past year to improve our inventory management processes and to work more closely with our customers to minimize losses due to excess inventories 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a decreased million  or  from million in to million in the decrease in sg a in was primarily attributable to a reduction in selling related expenses associated with lower sales in  partially offset by an increase in professional fees 
reorganization transaction costs 
in  we incurred costs  primarily for a fairness opinion and professional fees  of million related to the business combination between eftc and k tec 
during  we incurred additional costs of million  primarily for professional fees and printing costs 
this business combination  which was completed on february   was accounted for as a reorganization of entities under common control and  accordingly  these costs were charged to operations in the period in which the costs were incurred 
related party fees 
related party fees decreased million  or  from million in to million in in  affiliates of our majority stockholder charged fees of million for investment advisory services related to the credit facility entered into in january with citibank and million in connection with the merger of eftc and k tec 
during  affiliates of our majority stockholder charged management fees of million 
effective march   a new management fee arrangement was effective that provides for annual fees of million 
goodwill amortization 
during  goodwill amortization included million related to the acquisition of current electronics  inc and million related to the acquisition of k tec from kent electronics 
effective january   goodwill was no longer permitted to be amortized when statement of financial accounting standards no 
became effective 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased million  or  from million in to million in  primarily due to a decrease in average outstanding borrowings 
our weighted average borrowings decreased from million in to million in our weighted average interest rate computed without regard to amortization of debt issuance costs also decreased from in to in the most significant event leading to lower borrowings and interest rates in was the may conversion to common stock of over million of convertible notes held by thayer blum funding 
these notes accrued interest at and were converted to  shares of suntron common stock in may as a condition of the k tec merger agreement 
lower interest rates on our revolving credit facilities in also contributed to the reduction in interest expense 
the prime rate decreased by approximately percentage points during and the prime rate decreased by one half percentage point in these reductions in the prime rate also had a favorable impact because the interest rate on the revolving line of credit is a variable rate based on the prime and libor rates 
however  the positive impact of lower prime and libor rates in was partially offset by an increase in the margin in excess of these rates due to the november amendment to our credit agreement with citibank 
additionally  as we reduce the principal balance on the revolver  we are still subject to a commitment fee on the unused portion of the facility and these fees accounted for about two percentage points of our effective interest rate in a portion of the purchase price for the october acquisition of k tec was subject to a dispute that was expected to be resolved through arbitration proceedings 
on may   the parties agreed to settle the dispute  and the million principal balance of a note payable to the former owner was reduced by million  resulting in an adjusted principal balance of million 
this note  which provided for interest at  was repaid in may this settlement also resulted in a million benefit in due to elimination of previously accrued interest on the portion of the principal balance that was eliminated in the settlement 

table of contents gain loss on sale of assets 
in april  we entered into a settlement agreement with respect to the earn out calculation related to the sale of our services division 
as a result of this agreement  we received a final payment of million that accounted for million of the gain on sale of assets in in  we also recognized a gain of million from the sale of equipment 
in  we recognized a loss from the sale of equipment for million 
income taxes 
k tec and eftc reported their results separately for income tax purposes in and in  k tec generated earnings that resulted in an income tax provision of million 
in  k tec incurred a significant net loss which resulted in a tax benefit of million 
however  in eftc generated earnings that resulted in alternative minimum tax liability of million  resulting in nominal tax expense for on a combined basis 
in  the tax laws changed and the alternative minimum tax liability that we accrued in was eliminated  resulting in a tax benefit of million for cumulative effect of change in accounting for goodwill 
during the first quarter of  we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 which resulted in the requirement to perform a periodic impairment test  using a two step process 
the first step is to identify if potential impairment of goodwill exists 
if impairment of goodwill is determined to exist  the second step of the goodwill impairment test measures the amount of the impairment loss  using a fair value based approach 
based on the results of comparing the carrying value of goodwill with the implied fair value of goodwill  we concluded that goodwill related to the k tec reporting unit was impaired for the entire carrying value  which resulted in an impairment loss of million 
this impairment loss was recorded as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in liquidity and capital resources cash flows from operating activities 
net cash used by operating activities in was million  compared with net cash provided by operating activities of million in the difference between our net loss of million in and million of negative operating cash flow was primarily attributable to million of depreciation and amortization expense  a reduction in inventories of million  and million of amortization of debt issuance costs  partially offset by a reduction of million in accrued severance  retention and lease exit costs  an increase of million in trade receivables  a decrease in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities of million  and an increase in prepaid expenses of million 
days sales outstanding based on net sales for the year and net trade receivables outstanding at the end of the year increased to days for  compared to days for days sales outstanding has been increasing over the past year as the mix of our net sales has shifted away from customers that took advantage of discounts in exchange for accelerated payment terms 
we expect our net sales during the first quarter of will increase from million in the fourth quarter of even if we are successful in eliminating our cash operating losses in the first quarter of  it is likely that we will use cash in our operating activities  primarily due to an expected increase in receivables and inventories that usually occurs during periods of increasing production and sales 
aggregate net sales generated from our two major customers declined from about million in to million in  as both of these customers were impacted by adverse industry conditions 
during  we replaced some of this business with orders from smaller  less credit worthy customers 
while losses due to credit risk have not been a significant factor in the past  this trend may not continue in the future as we continue to diversify our major customer concentration with orders from smaller customers 
if delinquencies related to our receivables increase in the future  this could adversely affect our borrowing capacity because accounts that are aged more than days from the invoice date are ineligible for the borrowing base calculation under our credit agreement with citibank 
inventories decreased to million at december   compared to million at december  for  inventory turns ie  cost of goods sold for the year  excluding restructuring charges and credits  divided by year end inventories amounted to times per year compared to times per year for the reduction in inventory turns in is due in part to raw material purchases near the end of to support higher production requirements expected in the first quarter of 
table of contents cash flows from investing activities 
net cash used by investing activities for was million compared with net cash used by investing activities of million for investing cash flows in include capital expenditures of million for leasehold improvements at our olathe  kansas facility  million for new manufacturing equipment at several locations including approximately million for testing equipment to meet new customer manufacturing requirements  and million for software and computer equipment 
in july  we also paid million for the purchase of certain design and engineering assets from an entity affiliated with trilogic 
our cash outflows for investing activities were partially offset by million of cash acquired in the acquisition of trilogic 
during the first quarter of  we will be required to pay approximately million to the former owners of trilogic due to the earn out that was accrued in our consolidated balance sheet at december  we also expect to incur other capital expenditures during in the range of million to million  although we do not have any material firm commitments in place at this time 
a major portion of our planned capital expenditures is for building improvements and equipment related to expansion opportunities in mexico and texas 
investing cash flows for include the payment of approximately million in march for the acquisition of the assets of midwestern electronics  inc  and million for other capital expenditures 
cash flows from financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities for was million  compared with net cash used by financing activities of million for financing cash flows for reflect net borrowings under our revolving line of credit of million 
during  the company repaid million of debt assumed in the trilogic acquisition as well as other debt obligations of million 
during  we also paid debt issuance costs of million related to our amended credit facility with citibank 
for  financing cash flows reflect the net repayment of debt under revolving credit facilities of million  the repayment of million of debt to the former parent of k tec  the payment of million of debt issuance costs related to the credit facility with citibank  and a decrease in outstanding checks in excess of cash balances of million 
the company utilized temporary cash investments of approximately million at the end of to repay outstanding debt during contractual obligations 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  long term operating purchase bank debt leases obligations other total dollars in table are in millions year ending december after includes an aggregate of million  which has been included in the determination of our liability for lease exit costs that is recorded on our balance sheet at december  accounting principles generally accepted in the united states require that we record a liability for future lease payments  net of estimated sublease rentals  for facilities that we have closed 
consists of obligations under outstanding purchase orders 
approximately of the deliveries under outstanding purchase orders are expected to be received in the first quarter of we often have the ability to cancel these obligations if we provide sufficient notice to our suppliers 
includes payable for earn out calculation related to acquisition of trilogic systems for approximately million 
in august  we renewed an operating lease for our newberg  oregon facility 
the landlord is an entity that is affiliated with a director of the company 
the renewal terms provided for a reduction in our monthly rent from approximately  to  and the lease term was extended for five years through december 
table of contents the table shown above does not include contingent consideration related to the purchase of trilogic on may  pursuant to the purchase agreement  we may be required to pay up to approximately million if certain sales targets are achieved for for the year ended december   the minimum sales target was achieved and we accrued a payable of approximately million 
the agreement also requires that we estimate the annual amount of qualified sales based on actual sales for the first half of and calculate the estimated amount of consideration that would be payable for the annual sales target 
accordingly  we may be required to issue a letter of credit up to million in the third quarter of for the estimated amount of the contingent consideration payable related to the annual sales target 
the letter of credit for the sales target was issued in the fourth quarter of for approximately million and this letter of credit will be canceled after we make the accrued payment of million  which is expected to occur in the first quarter of we believe we will be able to fund our contractual operating lease and purchase order obligations from operating cash flows during the periods that payments are required 
we believe we will be able to fund the payments required under the trilogic acquisition agreement through borrowings under our credit agreement with citibank 
we have commenced negotiations with citibank and other prospective lenders for a new credit agreement that would provide for maturity date in three to five years 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in this regard 
capital resources 
our working capital at december  totaled million compared to million at december  at december   the borrowing base under our million revolving credit facility with citibank would have supported borrowings up to million  and we had outstanding borrowings of approximately million and outstanding letters of credit for million under this credit facility 
accordingly  as of december   we had unused availability of million after deducting outstanding borrowings  letters of credit  and an additional million that citibank temporarily removed from the borrowing base until operating performance improves to an acceptable level 
in march  citibank agreed to increase the advance rates for inventories under the borrowing base calculation 
after giving effect to this change  our unused availability increased to approximately million as of march  in connection with the may acquisition of trilogic systems  we agreed to issue a letter of credit for the estimated earn out payable for approximately million of our outstanding letters of credit relate to the trilogic earn out for which is also recorded under current liabilities in our balance sheet at december  as a result of the substantial net loss in  we would have violated year end restrictive covenants for ebitda and tangible net worth as contained in the credit agreement with citibank 
on march   citibank agreed to a permanent waiver of the year end covenant violations  as well as expected violations of the same covenants for the first quarter of on april   citibank agreed to amend the credit facility to provide less stringent covenants for ebitda and tangible net worth 
the amended facility continues to provide a revolving line of credit up to million  and the maturity date was extended until april borrowings under the amended credit facility bear interest at the prime rate plus for base rate borrowings and the libor rate plus for libor rate borrowings 
in addition  the company is obligated to pay a commitment fee of per annum of the unused portion of the credit facility up to million  plus an unused commitment fee of to the extent that the unused portion of the credit facility exceeds million 
the credit agreement also limits or prohibits us from paying dividends  incurring additional debt  selling significant assets  or merging with other entities without the consent of the lenders 
substantially all of our assets are pledged as collateral for outstanding borrowings 
as of december   the company is in compliance with the covenants under the amended credit facility with citibank 
total borrowings are subject to limitation based on a percentage of eligible accounts receivable  inventories  real estate  and equipment 
the continued availability of our credit facility with citibank  or a comparable credit facility  is a critical assumption underlying our belief that adequate capital resources are currently in place to fund our planned activities for the next months 
the borrowing base calculation under the citibank credit facility is based on a percentage of eligible receivables and inventories  plus the appraised value of certain real estate and equipment 
accordingly  our borrowing availability generally decreases as our net receivables and inventories decline 
however  the borrowing base generally increases as our net receivables and inventories increase 
if our sales begin to increase rapidly  this credit facility is critical to enable us to finance the increased working capital requirements associated with growth 

table of contents in order to ensure the continuing availability of funding under our credit facility  we are required to comply with certain financial and reporting covenants  including the ebitda covenant discussed on the following page 
while the ebitda financial covenant included in the april amended credit agreement is less stringent than the previous agreement  we are generally required to demonstrate sequential quarterly improvements in our financial performance beginning in the third quarter of if we violate the financial covenants in the future  there can be no assurance that citibank would waive our noncompliance 
in these circumstances  citibank could elect to withdraw the credit facility  which would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition  resulting in the need to seek other sources of financing 
we also have the ability to issue shares of our common stock to make acquisitions of businesses or to settle outstanding contractual obligations 
we also have the ability to sell our common stock in a public or private offering of securities to raise cash to fund working capital and other cash requirements 
however  we have not issued our common stock for these purposes over the past several years 
we believe that adequate capital resources are in place to fund our working capital and other cash requirements including up to million of contingent consideration related to earn out related to the trilogic acquisition for the next months 
however  depending on the amount of capital resources that are devoted to any future acquisitions of businesses  and increased working capital requirements if sales levels increase significantly  we may need to seek additional funds through public or private debt or equity offerings  bank borrowings  or leasing arrangements 
assuming that we are successful in eliminating our cash operating losses  we believe we have adequate capital resources to fund our planned operating activities for however  we intend to continue to evaluate strategic acquisitions to enhance our long term business prospects and we do not believe we have adequate capital resources to fund the purchase of any additional material business units 
accordingly  we have commenced discussions with citibank and other lenders to replace our current credit facility  which expires in april our objective is to put a new credit facility in place that will provide additional borrowing capacity and the flexibility to make strategic acquisitions 
while we believe the interest rates on a new facility would be competitive with our current facility with citibank  we will probably incur a material amount of origination and professional fees when a new or amended credit facility is put in place 
also  if a new facility is put in place  we would be required to write off unamortized debt issuance costs related to our current credit facility  which amounted to million as of december  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in securing additional financing or an amended agreement with citibank  and even if we are successful  the terms may be less favorable than our current agreement with citibank 
ebitda financial covenant 
the primary measure of our operating performance is net income loss 
however  the company s lenders and many investment analysts believe that other measures of operating performance are relevant 
one of these alternative measures is earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
management emphasizes that ebitda is a non gaap measurement that excludes many significant items that are also important to understanding and assessing suntron s financial performance 
additionally  in evaluating alternative measures of operating performance  it is important to understand that there are no standards for these calculations 
accordingly  the lack of standards can result in subjective determinations by management about which items may be excluded from the calculations  as well as the potential for inconsistencies between different companies that have similarly titled alternative measures 
in order to illustrate our ebitda calculations  we have provided the details below of the calculations for the years ended december  and using a traditional definition  as well as the calculation pursuant to the definition in our credit agreement with citibank 
citibank modifies its definition of ebitda to exclude certain operating charges that may be considered unlikely to recur in the future or that may be excluded due to a variety of other reasons 
as shown below  the measure of ebitda under a traditional definition differs materially from the calculation of ebitda under our credit agreement 
table of contents net loss cumulative effect of change in accounting principle income tax expense benefit interest expense interest reversed in settlement depreciation and amortization ebitda per traditional definition restructuring and reorganization costs benefit a other charges b ebitda per credit agreement definition a restructuring costs include lease exit costs  impairment of long lived assets  and severance  retention  and moving costs related to facility closures and other reductions in workforce 
restructuring costs exclude accelerated depreciation due to shortened lives of leasehold improvements since these amounts are included in depreciation and amortization expense 
b primarily consists of a bad debt charge related to a former customer  certain professional fees  stock based compensation expense  and cash costs related to restructuring activities 
in order to remain in compliance with the ebitda covenant under the amended credit agreement  the company s ebitda as defined in the credit agreement for the first quarter of must be more favorable than approximately negative million 
impact of recently issued accounting standards in july  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
this standard requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
examples of costs covered by this standard include lease termination costs and certain employee severance costs that are associated with a restructuring  discontinued operation  plant closing  or other exit or disposal activity 
previous accounting guidance was provided by eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
statement replaces issue the company has applied statement in accounting for all exit or disposal activities initiated after december  during  the company recognized restructuring costs including severance  retention  lease exit costs  moving and relocation under statement of approximately million  primarily due to consolidation of manufacturing operations in phoenix 
during  the company also recognized a lease termination credit of million related to the reversal of an accrual for exit and disposal activities that were initiated prior to the adoption of statement the adoption of statement resulted in a delay until the first quarter of in the recognition of lease exit costs of approximately million 
under issue  these costs would have been recognized in in november  the eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
eitf issue no 
provides guidance on how to account for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services and or rights to use assets 
the provisions of eitf issue no 
apply to revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  the provisions of eitf issue no 
did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
on december   the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab revenue recognition  which updates previous guidance contained in sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab provides additional clarification of the sec staff s interpretation of eitf issue no 
with respect to bill and hold transactions  undelivered elements of a sale that are both inconsequential or perfunctory and not essential to functionality  and the accounting for nonrefundable upfront fees 
the adoption of sab did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents factors that may affect future results an investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk 
you should carefully consider the factors described below  in addition to those discussed elsewhere in this report  in analyzing an investment in our common stock 
if any of the events described below occurs  our business  financial condition  and results of operations would likely suffer  the trading price of our common stock could fall  and you could lose all or part of the money you paid for our common stock 
in addition  the following factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in our forward looking statements  whether made in this form k  our annual or quarterly reports to stockholders  future press releases  other sec filings  or orally  whether in presentations  responses to questions  or otherwise 
see statement regarding forward looking statements 
we experience significant volatility in our net sales which leads to significant operating inefficiencies and the potential for significant charges 
as a result of the soft demand in the end markets served by our customers  our net sales declined from million in to million in to million in during periods of rapidly declining net sales  we generally take actions to eliminate variable and fixed costs which often results in significant restructuring charges 
when our net sales decline significantly  it is difficult to operate our plants profitably since it is not possible to eliminate most of our fixed costs 
if we determine that the decline in sales is unlikely to be followed by a rapid recovery  we may determine that there are significant benefits to reducing our cost structure by closing plants and transferring existing business to other plants that are also operating below optimal capacity levels 
in order to realize the long term benefits of these actions  we usually incur substantial charges for impairment of assets  lease exit costs  and the payment of severance and retention benefits to affected employees 
in addition to the up front costs associated with these actions  the transition of inventory and manufacturing services to a different facility can result in quality and delivery issues that may have an adverse impact in retaining customers that are affected by the plant closure 
our results of operations could also be materially and adversely affected by our inability to timely sell or sublet closed facilities on expected terms  or otherwise achieve the expected benefits of our restructuring activities 
conversely  customers may on occasion require rapid increases in production 
these situations often result in inefficiencies related to hiring and training workers  as well as incremental costs incurred to expedite the purchase and delivery of raw materials 
periods of rapid growth tend to stress our resources and we may not have sufficient capacity to meet our customers delivery requirements 
we are dependent upon the highly competitive electronics industry  and excess capacity or decreased demand for products produced by this industry could result in increased price competition as well as a decrease in our gross margins and unit volume sales 
our business is heavily dependent on the electronics manufacturing services industry  which is extremely competitive and includes hundreds of companies 
the contract manufacturing services we provide are available from many independent sources  and we compete with numerous domestic and foreign electronic manufacturing services firms  including benchmark electronics  inc  celestica inc  flextronics international ltd  jabil circuit  inc  pemstar  inc  plexus corp  sanmina sci corporation  smtc corporation  solectron corporation  sypris electronics  llc  and others 
many of such competitors are more established in the industry and have greater financial  manufacturing or marketing resources than we do 
we may be operating at a cost disadvantage as compared to our competitors that have greater direct buying power from component suppliers  distributors  and raw material suppliers and have lower cost structures 
in addition  many of our competitors have a broader geographic presence  including manufacturing facilities in asia  europe  and south america 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in our targeted market are quality  reliability  the ability to meet delivery schedules  technological sophistication  geographic location  and price 
we also face competition from our current and potential customers  who are continually evaluating the relative merits of internal manufacturing versus contract manufacturing for various products 
as stated above  the price of our services is often one of many factors that may be considered by prospective customers in awarding new business 
we believe existing and prospective customers are placing greater emphasis on contract manufacturers that can offer manufacturing services in low cost regions of the world  such as certain countries in asia 
accordingly  in situations where the price of our services is a primary driver in prospective customers decision to award new business  we currently believe we may have a competitive disadvantage in these circumstances 

table of contents a significant percentage of our net sales are generated from the aerospace and defense  semiconductor capital equipment  industrial  networking and telecommunications  and medical segments of the electronics industry  which is characterized by intense competition and significant fluctuations in product demand 
furthermore  these segments are subject to economic cycles and have experienced in the past  and are likely to experience in the future  recessionary economic cycles 
a recession or any other event leading to excess capacity or a downturn in these segments of the electronics industry results in intensified price competition as well as a decrease in our unit volume sales and our gross margins 
we are dependent on the aerospace industry 
our principal customer is engaged in the aerospace market 
see we are dependent upon a small number of customers for a large portion of our net sales  and a decline in sales to major customers would harm our results of operations 
consequently  a significant percentage of our net sales have been derived from the aerospace segment of the electronics industry 
the september  terrorist attacks using hijacked commercial aircraft and the ensuing war on terrorism have resulted in a reduction in demand for our services  which has had an adverse impact on our results of operations 
see we have experienced declining net sales 
in addition  continuing tensions in the middle east  have resulted in higher oil prices  which could result in further reductions in demand for products of our aerospace customers  which would have a continuing negative impact on our results of operations 
we are dependent upon a small number of customers for a large portion of our net sales  and a decline in sales to major customers would harm our results of operations 
a small number of customers are responsible for a significant portion of our net sales 
sales to honeywell and applied materials represented approximately and  respectively  of our net sales for the year ended december  for the year ended december   honeywell and applied materials accounted for and  respectively  of our net sales 
in  emulex was also a major customer but our net sales to emulex had been declining over the past two years and  by the end of the third quarter of  emulex had disengaged as a customer 
we expect a significant portion of our net sales will continue to be generated by a small number of customers 
our customer concentration could increase or decrease depending on future customer requirements  which will depend in large part on market conditions in the industry segments in which our customers participate 
the loss of one or more major customers or a decline in sales to our major customers could significantly harm our business and results of operations 
if we are not able to expand our customer base  we will continue to depend upon a small number of customers for a significant percentage of our net sales 
there can be no assurance that current customers  including honeywell and applied materials  will not terminate their manufacturing arrangements with us or significantly change  reduce  or delay the amount of manufacturing services ordered from us 
in addition  we generate significant accounts receivable in connection with providing services to our customers 
if one or more of our significant customers were to become insolvent or were otherwise unable or unwilling to pay for our services  our results of operations would deteriorate substantially 
our customers may cancel their orders  change production quantities  or delay production 
electronics manufacturing service providers must provide increasingly rapid product turnaround for their customers 
we generally do not obtain firm  long term purchase commitments from our customers  and we expect to continue to experience reduced lead times in customer orders 
customers may cancel their orders  change production quantities  or delay production for a number of reasons 
cancellations  reductions  or delays by a significant customer or by a group of customers would seriously harm our results of operations 
when customer orders are changed or cancelled  we may be forced to hold excess inventories and incur carrying costs as a result of delays  cancellations  or reductions in orders or poor forecasting by our key customers 
in addition  we make significant decisions  including determining the levels of business that we seek and accept  production schedules  component procurement commitments  personnel needs  and other resource requirements based on estimates of customer production requirements 
the short term nature of our customers commitments to us  combined with the possibility of rapid changes in demand for their products  reduces our ability 
table of contents to accurately estimate future customer orders 
in addition  because many of our costs and operating expenses are relatively fixed  a reduction in customer demand generally harms our operating results 
if we experience excess capacity due to variability in customer demand  our gross margins may decline 
we may schedule certain of our production facilities at less than full capacity to retain our ability to respond to additional quick turnaround orders 
however  if these orders are not received  we could experience losses due to excess capacity 
whenever we experience excess capacity  our sales revenue may be insufficient to fully cover our fixed overhead expenses and our gross margins will decline 
conversely  we may not be able to capture all potential revenue in a given period if our customers demands for quick turnaround services exceed our capacity during that period 
if we are unable to respond to rapid technological change and process development  we may not be able to compete effectively 
the market for our products and services is characterized by rapidly changing technology and continual implementation of new production processes 
the future success of our business will depend in large part upon our ability to maintain and enhance our technological capabilities  to develop and market products that meet changing customer needs  and to successfully anticipate or respond to technological changes on a cost effective and timely basis 
we expect that the investment necessary to maintain our technological position will increase as customers make demands for products and services requiring more advanced technology on a quicker turnaround basis 
in addition  the electronics manufacturing services industry could encounter competition from new or revised manufacturing and production technologies that render existing manufacturing and production technology less competitive or obsolete 
we may not be able to respond effectively to the technological requirements of the changing market 
if we need new technologies and equipment to remain competitive  the development  acquisition and implementation of those technologies may require us to make significant capital investments 
operating in foreign countries exposes us to increased risks that could adversely affect our results of operations 
we currently have foreign operations in mexico 
we may in the future expand into other foreign countries 
we have limited experience in managing geographically dispersed operations and in operating in foreign countries 
because of the scope of our international operations  we are subject to the following risks  which could adversely impact our results of operations economic or political instability  transportation delays and interruptions  increased employee turnover and labor unrest  incompatibility of systems and equipment used in foreign operations  foreign currency exposure  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign personnel and diverse cultures  and less developed infrastructures 
in addition  changes in policies by the united states or foreign governments could negatively affect our operating results due to increased duties  increased regulatory requirements  higher taxation  currency conversion limitations  restrictions on the transfer of funds  the imposition of or increase in tariffs  and limitations on imports or exports 
also  we could be negatively affected if our host countries revise their policies away from encouraging foreign investment or foreign trade  including tax holidays 
if we are unsuccessful in managing future opportunities for growth  our results of operations will be harmed 
our future results of operations will be affected by our ability to successfully manage future opportunities for growth 
rapid growth is likely to place a significant strain on our managerial  operational  financial  and other resources 
if this growth materializes  it may require us to implement additional management information systems  to further develop our operating  administrative  financial  and accounting systems and controls and to maintain close coordination among our accounting  finance  sales and marketing  and customer service and support 
table of contents departments 
in addition  we may be required to retain additional personnel to adequately support our growth 
if we cannot effectively manage periods of rapid growth in our operations  we may not be able to continue to grow  or we may grow at a slower pace 
any failure to successfully manage growth and to develop financial controls and accounting and operating systems or to add and retain personnel that adequately support growth could harm our business and financial results 
our results of operations are affected by a variety of factors  which could cause our results of operations to fail to meet expectations 
our results of operations have varied  and our results of operations may continue to fluctuate significantly from period to period  including on a quarterly basis 
our results of operations are affected by a number of factors  including timing of orders from and shipments to major customers  mix of products ordered by major customers  volume of orders as related to our capacity at individual locations  pricing and other competitive pressures  component shortages  which could cause us to be unable to meet customer delivery schedules  our ability to minimize inventory obsolescence and bad debt expense risk  our ability to manage effectively inventory and fixed asset levels  and timing and level of goodwill and other long lived asset impairments 
we are dependent on limited and sole source suppliers for electronic components and may experience component shortages  which would cause us to delay shipments to customers 
we are dependent on certain suppliers  including limited and sole source suppliers  to provide critical electronic components and other materials for our operations 
at various times  there have been shortages of some of the electronic components we use  and suppliers of some components have lacked sufficient capacity to meet the demand for these components 
for example  from time to time  some components we use  including semiconductors  capacitors  and resistors  have been subject to shortages  and suppliers have been forced to allocate available quantities among their customers 
such shortages have disrupted our operations in the past  which resulted in incomplete or late shipments of products to our customers 
our inability to obtain any needed components during future periods of allocations could cause delays in shipments to our customers 
the inability to make scheduled shipments could in turn cause us to experience a shortfall in revenue 
component shortages may also increase our cost of goods due to premium charges we may pay to purchase components in short supply 
accordingly  even though component shortages have not had a lasting negative impact on our business  component shortages could harm our results of operations for a particular fiscal period due to the resulting revenue shortfall or cost increases and could also damage customer relationships over a longer term period 
we depend on our key personnel and may have difficulty attracting and retaining skilled employees 
our future success will depend to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our key management  marketing  technical  financial  accounting and operational personnel  including james k 
bass  our president and chief executive officer 
the loss of the services of one or more key employees could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we also believe that our future success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain additional highly skilled managerial and technical resources 
competition for such personnel is intense 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel 
in addition  recent and potential future facility shutdowns and workforce reductions may have a negative impact on employee recruiting and retention 
our manufacturing processes depend on the collective industry experience of our employees 
if these employees were to leave and take this knowledge with them  our manufacturing processes may suffer and we may not be able to compete effectively 
we have no patent or trade secret protection for our manufacturing processes  but instead rely on the collective experience of our employees to ensure that we continuously evaluate and adopt new technologies in our industry 
although we are not dependent on any one employee or a small number of employees  if a significant 
table of contents number of employees involved in our manufacturing processes were to leave our employment and we are not able to replace these people with new employees with comparable experience  our manufacturing processes may suffer as we may be unable to keep up with innovations in the industry 
as a result  we may not be able to continue to compete effectively 
our failure to comply with the requirements of environmental laws could result in fines and revocation of permits necessary to our manufacturing processes 
our operations are regulated under a number of federal  state  and foreign environmental and safety laws and regulations that govern  among other things  the discharge of hazardous materials into the air and water  as well as the handling  storage  and disposal of such materials 
these laws and regulations include the clean air act  the clean water act  the resource conservation and recovery act  and the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act  as well as analogous state and foreign laws 
compliance with these environmental laws is a major consideration for us because our manufacturing processes use and generate materials classified as hazardous  such as ammoniacal etching solutions  copper  and nickel 
in addition  because we use hazardous materials and generate hazardous wastes in our manufacturing processes  we may be subject to potential financial liability for costs associated with the investigation and remediation of our own sites or sites at which we have arranged for the disposal of hazardous wastes  if such sites become contaminated 
even if we fully comply with applicable environmental laws and are not directly at fault for the contamination  we may still be liable 
the wastes we generate include spent ammoniacal etching solutions  solder stripping solutions  and hydrochloric acid solutions containing palladium  waste water that contains heavy metals  acids  cleaners  and conditioners  and filter cake from equipment used for on site waste treatment 
we have not incurred significant costs related to compliance with environmental laws and regulations in the prior three years  and we believe that our operations comply with all applicable environmental laws 
however  any material violations of environmental laws by us could subject us to revocation of our effluent discharge and other environmental permits 
any such revocations could require us to cease or limit production at one or more of our facilities 
even if we ultimately prevail  environmental lawsuits against us would be time consuming and costly to defend 
environmental laws could also become more stringent over time  imposing greater compliance costs and increasing risks and penalties associated with violation 
we operate in environmentally sensitive locations and are subject to potentially conflicting and changing regulatory agendas of political  business  and environmental groups 
changes or restrictions on discharge limits  emissions levels  or material storage  handling  or disposal might require a high level of unplanned capital investment or relocation 
it is possible that environmental compliance costs and penalties from new or existing regulations may harm our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
we may be subject to risks associated with acquisitions  and these risks could harm our results of operations 
we completed two business combinations in and one in  and we anticipate that we will seek to identify and acquire additional suitable businesses in the electronics manufacturing services industry 
the long term success of recent business combinations will depend on our ability to unite the business strategies  human resources and information technology systems of previously separate companies 
the difficulties of combining operations include the necessity of coordinating geographically separated organizations and integrating personnel with diverse business backgrounds 
combining management resources will result in changes affecting all employees and operations 
differences in management approach and corporate culture may strain employee relations 
future business combinations could cause certain customers to either seek alternative sources of product supply or service  or delay or change orders for products due to uncertainty over the integration of the two companies or the strategic position of the combined company 
as a result  we may experience some customer attrition 
acquisitions of companies and businesses and expansion of operations involve certain risks  including the following the business fails to achieve anticipated revenue and profit expectations  the potential inability to successfully integrate acquired operations and businesses or to realize anticipated synergies  economies of scale  or other value  diversion of management s attention  difficulties in scaling up production and coordinating management of operations at new sites  
table of contents the possible need to restructure  modify  or terminate customer relationships of the acquired business  loss of key employees of acquired operations  and the potential liabilities of the acquired businesses 
accordingly  we may experience problems in integrating the operations associated with any future acquisition 
we therefore cannot provide assurance that any future acquisition will result in a positive contribution to our results of operations 
in particular  the successful combination with any businesses we acquire will require substantial effort from each company  including the integration and coordination of sales and marketing efforts 
the diversion of the attention of management and any difficulties encountered in the transition process  including the interruption of  or a loss of momentum in  the activities of any business acquired  problems associated with integration of management information and reporting systems  and delays in implementation of consolidation plans  could harm our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of any future acquisition 
in addition  future acquisitions may result in dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurrence of additional debt  large one time write offs  and the creation of goodwill or other intangible assets that could result in increased impairment or amortization expense 
our level of indebtedness could adversely affect our financial viability  and the restrictions imposed by the terms of our debt instruments may severely limit our ability to plan for or respond to changes in our business 
as of december   we had outstanding bank debt of approximately million 
in addition  subject to the restrictions under our debt agreements  we may incur significant additional indebtedness from time to time to finance business acquisitions  capital expenditures  or for other purposes 
significant levels of debt could have negative consequences 
for example  it could require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service interest and principal repayment requirements  limiting the availability of cash for other purposes  increase our vulnerability to adverse general economic conditions by making it more difficult to borrow additional funds to maintain our operations if we suffer revenue shortfalls  limit our ability to attract new customers if we do not have sufficient liquidity to meet working capital needs  and hinder our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and industry if we are unable to borrow additional funds to upgrade our equipment or facilities 
we may need additional capital in the future and it may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
while we believe our capital resources are currently adequate  we may need to raise additional funds for the following purposes to fund working capital requirements for future growth that we may experience  to enhance or expand the range of services we offer  to increase our promotional and marketing activities  or to respond to competitive pressures or perceived opportunities  such as investment  acquisition  and international expansion activities 
if such funds are not available when required or on acceptable terms  our business and financial results could suffer 
our stock price may be volatile  and our stock is thinly traded  which could cause investors to lose all or part of their investments in our common stock 
the stock market has recently experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of any particular company or companies 
if market or industry based fluctuations continue  our stock price could decline regardless of our actual operating performance  and investors could lose a substantial part of their investments 
moreover  if an active public market for our stock is not sustained in the future  it may be difficult to resell our stock 
during and  the average number of shares of our common stock that traded on the nasdaq exchange amounted to approximately  shares per day compared to  issued and outstanding shares 

table of contents when trading volumes are this low  a relatively small buy or sell order can result in a large percentage change in the trading price of our common stock  which may be unrelated to changes in our stock price that are associated with our operating performance 
the market price of our common stock will likely fluctuate in response to a number of factors  including the following failure to meet the performance estimates of securities analysts  changes in estimates of our net sales and results of operations by securities analysts  announcements about the financial performance and prospects of the industries and customers we serve  announcements about the financial performance of our competitors in the electronic manufacturing services industry  the timing of announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts or acquisitions  and general stock market conditions 
our major stockholder controls us and our stock price could be influenced by actions taken by this stockholder 
additionally  this stockholder could prevent a change of control or other business combination  or could effect a short form merger without the approval of other stockholders 
thayer blum owns approximately of our common stock  and four of our nine directors are representatives of thayer blum 
the interests of thayer blum may not always coincide with those of our other stockholders  particularly if thayer blum decides to sell its controlling interest 
in addition  thayer blum will have sufficient voting power without the approval of suntron s other stockholders to elect the entire board of directors of suntron and  in general  to determine the outcome of various matters submitted to stockholders for approval  including fundamental corporate transactions 
thayer blum could cause us to take actions that we would not consider absent thayer blum s influence  or could delay  deter  or prevent a change of control or other business combination that might otherwise be beneficial to our public stockholders 
in addition  thayer blum could contribute its suntron stock to a subsidiary corporation that  as a stockholder  then would have the ability under delaware law to merge with or into suntron without the approval of the other suntron stockholders 
in the event of such a short form merger  suntron stockholders would have the right to assert appraisal dissenters rights to receive cash in the amount of the fair market value of their shares in lieu of the consideration they would have otherwise received from the transaction

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk on january   the company entered into a revolving line of credit agreement with citibank  na the amended credit agreement provides for total borrowings up to million 
the interest rate under this agreement is based either on the prime rate or libor rate  plus applicable margins 
therefore  as interest rates fluctuate  the company may experience changes in interest expense that will impact financial results 
the company has not entered into any interest rate swap agreements  or similar instruments  to protect against the risk of interest rate fluctuations 
assuming outstanding borrowings of million  if interest rates were to increase or decrease by one percentage point  the result would be an increase or decrease in annual interest expense of  accordingly  significant increases in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on the company s future results of operations
