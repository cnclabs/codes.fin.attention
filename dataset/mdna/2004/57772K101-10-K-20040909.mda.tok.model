critical accounting policies the methods  estimates and judgments the company uses in applying its most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results the company reports in its financial statements 
the securities and exchange commission has defined the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations  and require the company to make its most difficult and subjective accounting judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
based on this definition  the company s most critical accounting policies include revenue recognition and accounts receivable allowances  which impact the recording of revenues  valuation of inventories  which impacts costs of goods sold and gross margins  the assessment of recoverability of long lived assets  which impacts write offs of fixed assets  accounting for income taxes  which impacts the income tax provision  and assessment of contingencies  which impacts charges recorded in cost of goods sold and selling  general and administrative expenses 
these policies and the estimates and judgments involved are discussed further below 
the company has other key accounting policies that either do not generally require estimates and judgments that are as difficult or subjective  or it is less likely that such accounting policies would have a material impact on the company s reported results of operations for a given period 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable allowances revenue from product sales to the company s direct customers is recognized upon shipment  provided that persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists  the price is fixed and determinable  title has transferred  collection of resulting receivables is reasonably assured  there are no customer acceptance requirements  and there are no remaining significant obligations 
a portion of the company s sales is made to domestic distributors under agreements that provide the possibility of certain sales price rebates and limited product return privileges 
given the uncertainties associated with the levels of returns and other credits that will be issued to these distributors  the company defers recognition of such sales and related cost of goods sold until the product is sold by the domestic distributors to their end customers 
revenue on all shipments to international distributors is recognized upon shipment to the distributor  with appropriate provision of reserves for returns and allowances  as these distributors generally do not have price rebate or product return privileges other than non warranty product return privileges 
accounts receivable from both domestic and international distributors are recognized and inventory is relieved upon shipment as title to inventories generally transfers upon shipment at which point the company has a legally enforceable right to collection under normal terms 
the company must make estimates of potential future product returns and sales allowances related to current period product revenue 
management analyzes historical returns  changes in customer demand  and acceptance of products when evaluating the adequacy of sales returns and allowances 
estimates made by the company may differ from actual product returns and sales allowances 
these differences may materially impact reported revenue and amounts ultimately collected on accounts receivable 
in addition  the company monitors collectibility of accounts receivable primarily through review of the accounts receivable aging 
when facts and circumstances indicate the collection of specific amounts or from specific customers is at risk  the company assesses the impact on amounts recorded for bad debts and  if necessary  will record a charge in the period such determination is made 
to date  the company has not experienced material write offs of accounts receivable due to uncollectibility 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost  which approximates actual cost on a first in first out basis  or market value 
the company s standard cost revision policy is to continuously monitor manufacturing variances and revise standard costs when necessary 
because of the cyclicality of the market  inventory levels  obsolescence of technology  and product life cycles  the company writes down inventories to net realizable value based on months forecasted product demand 
actual demand and market conditions may be lower than those projected by the company 
this difference could have a material adverse effect on the company s gross margin should inventory write downs beyond those initially recorded become necessary 
alternatively  should actual demand and market conditions be more favorable than those estimated by the company  gross margin could be favorably impacted 
during fiscal years  and  the company had inventory write downs of million  million and million  respectively  due primarily to work in process and finished goods inventory manufactured in excess of forecasted demand 
long lived assets the company evaluates the recoverability of property  plant and equipment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the company performs periodic reviews to determine whether facts and circumstances exist that would indicate that the carrying amounts of property  plant and equipment might not be fully recoverable 
if facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of property  plant and equipment might not be fully recoverable  the company compares projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over their estimated remaining useful life against their respective carrying amounts 
in the event that the projected undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of the assets  the assets are written down to their estimated fair values based on the expected discounted future cash flows attributable to the assets 
evaluation of impairment of property  plant and equipment requires estimates in the forecast of future operating results that are used in the preparation of the expected future undiscounted cash flows 
actual future operating results and the remaining economic lives of the company s property  plant and equipment could differ from the company s estimates used in assessing the recoverability of these assets 
these differences could result in additional impairment charges  which could have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations 
accounting for income taxes the company records a valuation allowance to reduce the net deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  historical levels of income  expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and practicable tax planning strategies are considered 
in the event it is determined that the deferred tax assets to be realized in the future would be in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be recorded 
this adjustment would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should it be determined that all or part of the net deferred tax asset would not be realized in the future  an adjustment to increase the deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be charged to income in the period such determination would be made 
as of june   the company had recorded a valuation allowance against the net deferred tax asset of million attributable to the expected tax benefits on gains realized from the exercise of stock options  which if and when realized  will be recorded as a credit to additional paid in capital 
on a periodic basis the company evaluates its deferred tax asset balance for realizability 
to the extent the company believes it is more likely than not that some portion of its deferred tax assets will not be realized  the company will increase the valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets 
realization of the company s deferred tax assets is dependent primarily upon future us taxable income 
the company s judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions  changes in us or international tax laws and other factors 
these changes  if any  may require possible material adjustments to these deferred tax assets  resulting in a reduction in net income or an increase in net loss in the period when such determinations are made 
contingencies from time to time  the company receives notices that its products or manufacturing processes may be infringing the patent or intellectual property rights of others 
the company periodically assesses each matter in order to determine if a contingent liability in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for contingencies  should be recorded 
in making this determination  management may  depending on the nature of the matter  consult with internal and external legal counsel and technical experts 
based on the information obtained combined with management s judgment regarding all the facts and circumstances of each matter  the company determines whether it is probable that a contingent loss may be incurred and whether the amount of such loss can be estimated 
should a loss be probable and estimable  the company records a contingent loss in accordance with sfas in determining the amount of a contingent loss  the company takes into consideration advice received from experts in the specific matter  current status of legal proceedings  settlement negotiations which may be ongoing  prior case history and other factors 
should the judgments and estimates made by management be incorrect  the company may need to record additional contingent losses that could materially adversely impact the company s results of operations 
alternatively  if the judgments and estimates made by management are incorrect and a particular contingent loss does not occur  the contingent loss recorded would be reversed thus favorably impacting the company s results of operations 
results of operations net revenues the company reported net revenues of  million in fiscal year  a increase from net revenues of  million in fiscal year net revenues increased by from the fourth quarter of fiscal year to the first quarter of fiscal year  and increased by and sequentially during the second and the third quarters of fiscal year  respectively 
net revenues increased by from the third to fourth quarter of fiscal year the increase in quarterly net revenues for fiscal year is primarily related to higher unit shipments resulting from increased order rates in the company s already existing proprietary and second source products and the introduction of new proprietary products 
the company reported net revenues of  million in fiscal year  a increase from net revenues of  million in fiscal year net revenues increased by from the fourth quarter of fiscal year to the first quarter of fiscal year and remained flat during the second and third quarters of fiscal year net revenues increased by from the third to fourth quarter of fiscal year the increase in quarterly net revenues for fiscal year was primarily related to higher unit shipments resulting from the introduction of new proprietary products and increased order rates in the company s already existing proprietary and second source products 
approximately  and of the company s net revenues in fiscal years   and  respectively  were derived from customers located outside the united states  primarily in the pacific rim  europe  and japan 
while the majority of these sales are denominated in us dollars  the company enters into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate its risks on firm commitments and net monetary assets denominated in foreign currencies 
the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on net revenues and the company s results of operations for fiscal years   and was immaterial 
gross margin the company s gross margin as a percentage of net revenues was in fiscal year compared to in fiscal year the gross margin percentage increased slightly from fiscal year to fiscal year due to lower manufacturing costs driven by increased manufacturing volumes and eight inch wafer manufacturing which began in volume in fiscal year these improvements were offset by million of discretionary employee bonuses awarded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year and million of start up costs at the company s newly acquired wafer fabrication facility in san antonio  texas 
gross margins for both fiscal and fiscal were negatively impacted due to million and million of inventory write downs  respectively 
the company s gross margin as a percentage of net revenues was in fiscal year compared to in fiscal year the improvement in gross margin as a percentage of net revenues from fiscal year to fiscal year was attributable to cost saving measures implemented by the company 
these cost saving measures included  but were not limited to  salary and wage reductions  reduced headcount and reductions in certain salary related expenses 
these reductions were slightly offset by revenue growth in lower margin products 
gross margins for both fiscal and fiscal were negatively impacted due to million and million of inventory write downs  respectively 
research and development research and development expenses were million and million for fiscal years and  respectively  which represented and of net revenues  respectively 
the increase in research and development expenses in absolute dollars is due to the million of discretionary employee bonuses awarded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the result of hiring additional engineers and increased mask expenses to support the company s new product development efforts 
research and development expenses were million and million for fiscal years and  respectively  which represented and of net revenues  respectively 
the decrease in research and development expenses in absolute dollars was due to cost saving measures implemented by the company 
these cost saving measures included  but were not limited to  salary and wage reductions  reduced headcount and reductions in certain salary related expenses 
the level of research and development expenditures as a percentage of net revenues will vary from period to period  depending  in part  on the level of net revenues and  in part  on the company s success in recruiting the technical personnel needed for its new product introductions and process development 
the company continuously attempts to control and  if possible  reduce expense levels in all areas including research and development 
however  the company views research and development expenditures as critical to maintaining a high level of new product introductions  which in turn are critical to the company s plan for future growth 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses were million and million in fiscal years and  respectively  which represented and of net revenues  respectively 
the increase in selling  general  and administrative expenses in absolute dollars in fiscal year is primarily related to million of discretionary employee bonuses awarded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year and increased salary related expense which were mainly due to increases in headcount 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million and million in fiscal years and  respectively  which represented and of net revenues  respectively 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of net revenues in fiscal year was primarily due to the cost saving measures implemented by the company during fiscal year these cost saving measures included  but were not limited to  salary and wage reductions  reduced headcount and reductions in certain salary related expenses 
interest income and other  net interest income and other  net increased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the increase in interest income is due to higher average interest rates combined with higher average levels of invested cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments 
interest income and other  net decreased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year this decrease was due to significantly lower average interest rates combined with lower average levels of invested cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments 
provision for income taxes the effective tax rate was for fiscal years  and the fiscal years  and effective rates were lower than the us federal and state combined statutory rate primarily due to tax benefits on export sales 
realization of the net deferred tax asset of million at june  is dependent primarily upon achieving future us taxable income of million 
the company believes it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized based on historical earnings and expected levels of future taxable income 
levels of future taxable income are subject to the various risks and uncertainties discussed in item  business trends  risks and uncertainties 
an increase in the valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets may be necessary if it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the net deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the company periodically assesses the need for increases to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance

outlook at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal year  backlog shippable within the next months was approximately million compared to million at the end of fiscal year  including approximately million compared to million at the end of fiscal year requested for shipment in the first quarter of fiscal year because the company s backlog of orders at any point is not necessarily based on firm  noncancelable orders and because the company s customers do in fact routinely cancel orders for their own convenience with little notice  backlog has limited value as a predictor of future revenues 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  bookings were approximately million  a increase over the previous quarter s level of million 
turns orders received during the fourth quarter of fiscal year were approximately million turns orders are customer orders that are for delivery within the same quarter and may result in revenue within the same quarter if the company has available inventory that matches those orders 
compared with the third quarter of fiscal year  bookings increased in all geographic regions except europe  with the strongest bookings growth coming from pacific rim and japan 
the fourth quarter of fiscal year results were generally consistent with the company s expectations 
net revenues increased approximately over the third quarter of fiscal year the company believes that its net revenues will be higher in the first quarter of fiscal year than in the fourth quarter of fiscal year with fiscal year expected to be another strong growth year  the company has put in place the capacity  personnel  and infrastructure to support its fiscal year revenues 
continued successful execution will depend on its ability to recruit and retain the engineering talent that will forge new products in fiscal year it is the company s goal to hire over  employees during fiscal year  and its employee stock option program will be a key tool in recruiting and retaining premier technical talent 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources overview total assets increased to  million at the end of fiscal year  up from  million at the end of fiscal year cash  cash equivalent and short term investments decreased to million in fiscal year from  million in fiscal year this decrease was primarily due to the repurchase of million shares of the company s common stock for million  the purchase of million of property  plant and equipment  and the payment of million of dividends 
the above decreases were offset by cash generated from operations of million in fiscal and million from employee stock option exercises and stock purchase plan purchases 
net accounts receivable increased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year due to the increase in net revenues from  million in fiscal year to  million in fiscal year current deferred tax assets increased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year primarily due to timing differences between tax and financial reporting 
accounts payable increased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year primarily due to capital additions and additional expenses required to support the increased level of net revenues noted above 
accrued salary and related expense increased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year primarily due to increased headcount  increased salaries and salary related expenses required to support revenue growth 
noncurrent deferred tax liabilities increased to million at the end of fiscal year from million at the end of fiscal year primarily due to timing differences between tax and financial reporting related to plant and equipment depreciation 
liquidity and capital resources the company s primary sources of funds for fiscal years   and has been from net cash generated from operating activities of approximately million  million and million  respectively 
in addition  the company received approximately million  million and million of proceeds from the exercises of stock options and purchases of common stock under the employee stock participation plan during fiscal years   and  respectively 
another source of cash from the company s stock option programs is the tax deductions that arise from exercise of options 
these tax benefits amounted to million  million and million in fiscal years   and  respectively 
the principal uses of funds for fiscal years   and were repurchases of million  million and million of the company s common stock  purchases of property  plant and equipment of million  million and million and dividends paid of million  million and  respectively 
the company will continue to repurchase its common stock in fiscal year the number of shares to be repurchased and the timing of such repurchases will be based on several factors  including the price of the company s common stock  general market conditions  and other factors 
see note common stock repurchases of the notes to consolidated financial statements regarding repurchases of common stock 
the company is subject to pending legal proceedings 
see note commitments and contingencies of the notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding pending patent litigation 
although the results of such legal proceedings are unpredictable  the company does not believe that any pending legal proceedings will have a material adverse impact on its liquidity or financial position 
however  were ltc or qualcomm to prevail in their claims against the company  the company s operating results could be materially adversely affected 
as of june   the company s available funds consisted of  million in cash  cash equivalents  and highly liquid investment securities 
the company anticipates that the available funds and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet cash and working capital requirements  including its anticipated level of capital expenditures  common stock repurchases  and dividend payments for the next twelve months 
during the first quarter of fiscal year  the board of directors declared a cash dividend of per share on the company s common stock payable on august  to stockholders of record on august  contractual obligation the following table provides a summary of the effect on liquidity and cash flows from the company s contractual obligation as of june  amounts in thousands fiscal year thereafter total contractual obligations noncancellable operating leases off balance sheet arrangements as of june   the company did not have any material off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company s investment portfolio  which includes us treasury  federal agency debt securities and repurchase agreements relating to such securities 
investments mature at frequent intervals during the year  at which time the funds are available for use in the business  or for reinvestment  as cash demands dictate 
the company places its investments only in high quality financial instruments  limits the amount invested in any one institution or instrument  and limits portfolio duration 
this policy is intended to reduce default risk  market risk  and reinvestment risk 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio 
the fair value of the company s investment portfolio would vary by approximately million by a change in market interest rates of basis points 
exposure to interest rate fluctuations is mitigated by maintaining a laddered portfolio of investment instruments that mature at regular intervals over a three year investment horizon 
by creating a steady stream of cash from maturing investments  the company intends to generate cash to meet business needs without liquidating investments 
at june   the company s investment portfolio had an expected weighted average return of at june  and a weighted maturity of days days at june  
foreign currency risk the company transacts business in various non us currencies  primarily the japanese yen  british pound  and the euro 
the company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on accounts receivable from sales in these foreign currencies and the net monetary assets and liabilities of the related foreign subsidiary 
the company has established risk management strategies designed to protect against reductions in value and volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in exchange rates 
these strategies reduce  but do not always entirely eliminate  the impact of currency exchange movements 
currency forward contracts are used to offset the currency risk of non us dollar denominated assets and liabilities 
changes in fair value of the underlying assets and liabilities are generally offset by the changes in fair value of the related currency forward contract 
the net realized and unrealized gains or losses from hedging non us dollar denominated assets and liabilities were immaterial in fiscal years and the company had forward contracts to sell foreign currencies for million and million at june  and june   respectively 
the fair market value of these forward contracts was million and million at june  and june   respectively 
a hypothetical favorable or unfavorable change in foreign currency exchange rates compared to rates at june  and june  would have an insignificant impact on our financial position or results of operations
