critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities if any 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to product discounts and returns  bad debts  inventories  income taxes  warranty obligations  product liabilities  restructuring  closed mine obligations  pensions and other post retirement benefits  and contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience  actuarial valuations and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
product liabilities the company provides for the estimated cost of personal and property damage relating to the company s products 
reserves are made for estimates of the costs for known claims and estimates of the costs of incidents that have occurred but for which a claim has not yet been reported to the company  in excess of available insurance coverage 
while the company engages in extensive product quality reviews and customer education programs  the company s product liability provision is affected by the number and magnitude of claims of alleged product related damage and the cost to defend those claims 
in addition  the provision for product liabilities is also affected by changes in assumptions for medical costs  inflation rates  trends in damages awarded by juries and estimates of the number of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported 
changes to the estimate of any of these factors could result in a material change to the company s product liability provision causing a related increase or decrease in reported net operating results in the period of change in the estimate 
closed mine obligations the company s wholly owned subsidiary  bellaire corporation bellaire  is a non operating subsidiary with legacy liabilities relating to closed mining operations  primarily former eastern us underground mining operations 
these legacy liabilities include obligations for black lung and other retiree medical benefits  environmental clean up and obligations to the united mine workers of america combined benefit fund arising as a result of the coal industry retiree health benefit act of provisions made by bellaire for these liabilities include estimates of the number of beneficiaries assigned to bellaire  medical cost trend rates  inflation rates  actuarially determined mortality tables  cost of ongoing environmental clean up  discount factors and legal costs to defend claims 
in addition  these liabilities can be influenced by judicial proceedings  legislative actions and changes in regulations made by government agencies 
the company continually monitors the regulatory climate which could influence these liabilities as well as the assumptions used to develop accruals for these liabilities 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations nacco industries  inc 
and subsidiaries tabular amounts in millions  except per share  unit  store and percentage data changes in any of these factors could materially change the company s estimates for these closed mine obligations causing a related increase or decrease in reported net operating results in the period of change in the estimate 
see note and note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of closed mine obligations 
goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  the company is required to test goodwill for impairment at least annually 
changes in management s judgments and estimates could significantly affect the company s analysis of the impairment of goodwill 
to test goodwill for impairment  the company is required to estimate the fair value of each of its reporting units 
since quoted market prices in an active market are not available for the company s reporting units  the company uses other valuation techniques 
the company has developed a model to estimate the fair value of the reporting units  primarily incorporating a discounted cash flow valuation technique 
this model incorporates the company s estimates of future cash flows  allocations of certain assets and cash flows among reporting units  future growth rates and management s judgment regarding the applicable discount rates to use to discount those estimated cash flows 
changes to these judgments and estimates could result in a significantly different estimate of the fair value of the reporting units which could result in an impairment of goodwill 
revenue recognition revenues are generally recognized when title transfers or risk of loss passes as customer orders are completed and shipped 
for nmhg s national account customers  revenue is recognized upon customer acceptance 
under its mining contracts  the company recognizes revenue as the coal is delivered 
reserves for discounts  returns and product warranties are maintained for anticipated future claims 
the accounting policies used to develop these product discounts  returns and warranties include product discounts the company records estimated reductions to revenues for customer programs and incentive offerings  including special pricing agreements  price competition  promotions and other volume based incentives 
at nmhg  truck sales revenue is recorded net of projected discounts 
the estimated discount amount is based upon historical trends for each truck model 
in addition to standard discounts  dealers can also request additional discounts that allow them to offer price concessions to customers 
from time to time  nmhg offers special incentives to increase retail share or dealer stock and offers certain customers volume rebates if a specified cumulative level of purchases is obtained 
at hbwps net sales represent gross sales less negotiated price allowances based primarily on volume purchasing levels  estimated returns and allowances for defective products 
at kci  retail markdowns are incorporated into kci s retail method of accounting for cost of goods sold 
if market conditions were to decline or if competition was to increase  the company may take actions to increase customer incentive offerings  possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenues at the time the incentive is offered 
product returns products generally are not sold with the right of return 
however  based on the company s historical experience  a portion of products sold are estimated to be returned due to reasons such as buyer remorse  duplicate gifts received  product failure and excess inventory stocked by the customer which  subject to certain terms and conditions  the company will agree to accept 
the company records estimated reductions to revenues at the time of sale based on this historical experience and the limited right of return provided to certain customers 
if future trends were to change significantly from those experienced in the past  incremental reductions to revenues may result based on this new experience 
product warranties the company provides for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenues are recognized 
while the company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers  the company s warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  labor costs and replacement component costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  labor costs or replacement component costs differ from the company s estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required which would affect net income 
allowances for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
these allowances are based on both recent trends of certain customers estimated to be a greater credit risk as well as general trends of the entire customer pool 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory reserves the company writes down its inventory to the lower of cost or market  which includes an estimate for obsolescence or excess inventory based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
upon a subsequent sale or disposal of the impaired inventory  the corresponding reserve for impaired value is relieved to ensure that the cost basis of the inventory reflects any write downs 
deferred tax valuation allowances the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
a valuation allowance has been provided item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations nacco industries  inc 
and subsidiaries tabular amounts in millions  except per share  unit  store and percentage data against certain deferred tax assets related to non us and state net operating loss carryforwards 
management believes the reserves are adequate after considering future taxable income  allowable carryforward periods and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
in the event the company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount including the valuation allowance  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
conversely  should the company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be expensed in the period such determination was made 
retirement benefit plans the company maintains various defined benefit pension plans covering most of its employees 
in  pension benefits were frozen for employees covered under nmhg s and hbwps united states plans  except for those nmhg employees participating in collective bargaining agreements 
as a result  in the united states only nacoal employees and certain nmhg employees covered under collective bargaining agreements will earn retirement benefits under defined benefit pension plans 
other employees of the company  including nmhg and hbwps employees whose pension benefits were frozen as of december   will receive retirement benefits under defined contribution retirement plans 
the company s policy is to periodically make contributions to fund these plans within the range allowed by applicable regulations 
plan assets consist primarily of publicly traded stocks  investment contracts and government and corporate bonds 
there is no guarantee that the actual return on the plans assets will equal the expected long term rate of return on plan assets or that the plans will not incur investment losses 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets reflects management s expectations of long term rates of return on funds invested to provide for benefits included in the projected benefit obligations 
the company has established the expected long term rate of return assumption for plan assets by considering historical rates of return over a period of time that is consistent with the long term nature of the underlying obligations of these plans 
the historical rates of return for each of the asset classes used by the company to determine its estimated rate of return assumption at its september measurement date were based upon the rates of return earned by investments in the equivalent benchmark market indices for each of the asset classes over the time period from january  to september  and during both the significant market gains in the s and  as well as the recent period of depressed market returns during through  the company held to a expected rate of return assumption 
the plans maintain an investment policy that  among other things  establishes a portfolio asset allocation methodology with percentage allocation bands for individual asset classes 
this investment policy states that the plans invest from to in equity securities and from to in fixed income securities 
the investment policy further divides investments in equity securities among separate allocation bands for equities of large cap companies  equities of medium and small cap companies and equities of non us companies 
the investment policy provides that investments are reallocated between asset classes as balances exceed or fall below the appropriate allocation bands 
the company also maintains health care and life insurance plans which provide benefits to eligible retired employees 
under the company s current policy  plan benefits are funded at the time they are due to participants 
the plans have no assets 
assumed health care cost trend rates can have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans 
a one percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects on pre tax income percentage point percentage point increase decrease effect on total of service and interest cost effect on postretirement benefit obligation see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the company s retirement benefit plans

and subsidiaries tabular amounts in millions  except per share  unit  store and percentage data nacco materials handling group overview nmhg designs  engineers  manufactures  sells  services and leases a comprehensive line of lift trucks and aftermarket parts marketed globally under the hyster and yale brand names 
the company manages its operations as two reportable segments wholesale manufacturing nmhg wholesale and retail distribution nmhg retail 
nmhg wholesale includes the manufacture and sale of lift trucks and related service parts  primarily to independent and wholly owned hyster and yale retail dealerships 
nmhg retail includes the sale  leasing and service of hyster and yale lift trucks and related service parts by wholly owned retail dealerships and rental companies 
nmhg retail includes the elimination of intercompany revenues and profits resulting from sales by nmhg wholesale to nmhg retail 
demand for lift trucks is cyclical and depends upon capital budgeting in a variety of end markets where lift trucks are sold 
nmhg believes its market  like the broader global economy  has begun to recover and is poised for further growth 
in order to streamline manufacturing processes and transfer processes and sourcing to low cost locations  nmhg developed and implemented global restructuring programs during the last three years  which included the closure of assembly facilities  labor and overhead reductions and restructuring of its owned dealers 
these programs have reduced and will continue to reduce costs and more closely align operations with the demand for products and services  while maintaining substantially the same lift truck production capacity in fewer facilities 
in addition to the global restructuring programs  nmhg has undertaken other global programs to reduce costs  while improving the quality of its products in order to take advantage of opportunities in its markets 
nmhg s quality improvement program has focused on improving quality in all aspects of its business  including specific programs to enhance reliability  improve vendor and plant quality and reduce warranty costs 
along with its programs to reduce costs and improve quality  nmhg has continued to focus on growth opportunities through developing new products  expanding its national and global accounts and strengthening its dealer network 
nmhg continuously strives to improve its product offerings by the development of new products and enhancements to existing products 
included in current product development activities is the development of a new series of to ton internal combustion engine lift trucks  which represents one of the most significant product development projects in nmhg s history 
global and national accounts programs focus on large customers with centralized purchasing but geographically diverse operations and offer these customers the ability to purchase equipment directly from nmhg while receiving service and support from its dealer network 
nmhg continues to develop its worldwide network of owned and independent dealers as a critical component of its growth strategy 
nmhg believes these cost reduction  quality improvement and growth programs have positioned the company to take advantage of the continued recovery in the capital goods market  and will result in reduced fixed overhead costs  lower manufacturing costs and improvements in both gross margins and operating profit 
some savings are volume sensitive and the program benefits are based on future unit volume levels that are consistent with historical industry demand cycle patterns 
in addition  in  the costs associated with current development programs will continue to be significant and offset the benefits of cost reduction programs 
if future industry demand levels are lower than historical industry demand cycles would indicate  or if on going operating costs  including engineering costs  are higher than projected  the actual annual savings and benefits from these programs could be lower than anticipated

a million pre tax write down was recorded in for an other than temporary decline in the value of a preferred stock investment in a us dealer accounted for under the cost method 
as a result of significant losses in and at the dealer and the uncertainty concerning the dealer s future financial performance  it was determined that the investment had suffered an other than temporary impairment 
accordingly  the company recorded a write down of its investment for the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the investment 
no other significant losses are anticipated as a result of this investment 
additionally  in  the company recorded a million impairment charge against its investment related to a interest in the equity of an unconsolidated parts distributor in australia 
in the third quarter of  an independent third party purchased the remaining of the equity of the distributor 
based on the purchase price paid for the remaining  nmhg determined that its investment was impaired and  thus  recorded a pre tax impairment charge of million 
subsequently  in the fourth quarter of  nmhg sold its investment in the parts distributor to the owner 
no significant additional loss was recorded at the time of the sale 
similarly  the decline in income from other unconsolidated affiliates in compared with was due to the adjustments recorded during the us customs award of million represents an anti dumping settlement received by nmhg during the insurance recovery of million recognized in relates to a final recovery from flood damages incurred in september at sumitomo nacco materials handling group  ltd

unit shipments increased to  units in from  units in the increase in unit shipments was due in part to a low level of sales in the first half of due to depressed market conditions 
in addition to improved unit volumes  revenues also benefited from the favorable impact of foreign currencies in europe and asia pacific compared with as a result of the strength of foreign currencies compared with the us dollar during the decline in service parts revenues  despite an increase in parts volume  was a result of a partial shift to direct ship sales 
under direct ship sales  nmhg s dealers sell parts that are shipped directly from nmhg to the end user and nmhg recognizes commissions on sales of parts rather than the gross sales amount 
operating profit the following table identifies the components of the changes in operating profit for compared with operating profit restructuring charge increase decrease in from standard margin other cost of sales selling  general and administrative foreign currency nmhg wholesale s operating profit increased million  or  to million in compared with million in the increase was primarily due to an increase in standard margin as a result of the increase in unit volume discussed above and an improvement in units and parts margins

operating profit also increased in compared with as a result of restructuring charges taken in in  nmhg wholesale recorded a million charge for the restructuring of certain operations in the americas and europe 
see further discussion in restructuring plan below 
the factors positively impacting operating profit were partially offset by an increase in selling  general and administrative expenses  net of foreign currency effects  primarily due to increased spending on product development and marketing  as well as increased employee related expenses 
the increase in product development and marketing expenses were in large part due to spending on redesign and introduction of the to ton internal combustion engine lift trucks

during  nmhg wholesale recognized certain favorable tax adjustments including a million settlement from a transfer pricing tax audit and a million tax benefit related to the recognition of previously generated losses in china 
backlog the worldwide backlog level was  units at december  compared with  units at december  and  units at september  the increase from was primarily due to increased demand for lift trucks in the americas 
the decrease from september was primarily due to strong shipping performance in the fourth quarter of restructuring plan in  management committed to the restructuring of certain operations in the americas and europe 
as such  nmhg wholesale recognized a restructuring charge of million pre tax million after tax  of which million relates to a non cash asset impairment charge and million relates to severance and other employee benefits to be paid to approximately manufacturing and administrative employees 
severance payments began in and are expected to continue through as announced in december  nmhg wholesale will phase out its lenoir  north carolina  lift truck component facility and restructure other manufacturing and administrative operations  primarily its irvine  scotland  lift truck assembly and component facility 
these actions are designed to essentially complete the restructuring of nmhg wholesale s global manufacturing facility infrastructure 
previously announced programs  such as demand flow technology  selected component outsourcing and innovative lift truck designs have enabled nmhg to maintain substantially unchanged lift truck production capacity in fewer facilities and at a reduced cost 
the phase out of the lenoir component facility is expected to be completed during the lenoir plant s lift truck component operations  including mast and cylinder manufacturing  are being consolidated into plants in sulligent  alabama  berea  kentucky  and greenville  north carolina 
the irvine assembly and component facility is expected to be restructured to an appropriately sized operation 
the restructured facility is expected to manufacture three and four wheel electric rider lift trucks and mast components for the european market 
other lift truck components currently manufactured in irvine will be outsourced to independent suppliers

 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the adoption of the statement is discussed further in note and note to the consolidated financial statements 
excluding these non comparable items  the increase in operating profit was primarily driven by an increase in standard margin mainly due to a shift in mix to higher margin lift trucks and the positive impact on the cost of sales from improvement programs initiated in  including the completion of the danville  illinois  plant closure in the fourth quarter of and the benefits of procurement  restructuring and cost control programs

the positive effect of these factors was partially offset by i increased interest expense  including the amortization of deferred financing fees  ii the negative effect of interest rate swap agreements and iii a charge for the impairment of certain investments in unconsolidated affiliates 
the increase in interest expense  the negative effect of interest rate swap agreements and the amortization of deferred financing fees relate to the refinancing of nmhg s debt during the second quarter of  which is discussed further in liquidity and capital resources 
also affecting the year over year comparability of net income is a pre tax insurance recovery of million million after tax included in other income in relating to flood damage in september at sn and a million after tax charge in for the cumulative effect of accounting changes for derivatives and pension costs 
and restructuring plans in  management committed to the restructuring of certain wholesale operations in europe 
as such  nmhg wholesale recognized a restructuring charge of approximately million pre tax for severance and other employee benefits to be paid to approximately manufacturing and administrative personnel in europe

during  an additional impairment charge of million was recorded to further reduce the book value of this facility to its market value based upon market conditions at year end 
cost savings primarily from reduced employee wages and benefits of approximately million and million pre tax were realized in and  respectively  related to this program 
cost savings primarily from reduced employee wages and benefits are estimated to be million pre tax  net of idle facility costs  in and million pre tax annually thereafter  as a result of anticipated improved manufacturing efficiencies and reduced fixed factory overhead 
although a significant portion of the projected savings is the result of a reduction in fixed factory costs  the overall benefit estimates could vary depending on unit volumes and the resulting impact on manufacturing efficiencies

the million in other non cash charges recorded in consisted of million in charges to reduce asset values and increase reserves reflective of weakened capital goods markets 
these adjustments were made at wholly owned retail dealers  primarily in europe 
the adjustment to reduce asset values consisted primarily of a write down of inventory values to their estimated fair value 
due to softening demand during the second half of  estimates of the fair value declined significantly such that a write down of new and used units and parts was necessary 
the increase in reserves was primarily for uncollectible accounts receivable and estimated losses on warranty  extended service and rental contracts 
the increase in the reserve for uncollectible accounts receivable was primarily due to a significant deterioration in the aging of accounts receivable such that collection of certain accounts was not likely 
the recognition of estimated losses in warranty  service and rental contracts was primarily due to recent trends and changes in estimates on certain warranty  service and rental contracts  which indicated that future costs would exceed future revenues under those contracts 
also included in the million of other non cash charges was a million charge to establish full accounting consistency among owned dealers  primarily for acquisition accounting adjustments recorded outside of the one year window from the date of acquisition and final integration of corporate accounting policies by recently acquired foreign dealers 
in addition  a million charge was included to have those dealers previously reporting on a one month lag report on months consistent with the rest of nmhg

also contributing to the decrease was an increase in financing fees as a result of the may debt refinancing and increases in payments to nacco for dividends and notes payable 
financing activities on may   nmhg replaced its primary financing agreement  an unsecured floating rate revolving line of credit with availability of up to million  certain other lines of credit with availability of million and a program to sell accounts receivable in europe  with the proceeds from the sale of million of unsecured senior notes due and borrowings under a secured  floating rate revolving credit facility which expires in may the proceeds from the senior notes were reduced by an original issue discount of million 
the million of senior notes mature on may  availability under the revolving credit facility is up to million and is governed by a borrowing base derived from advance rates against the inventory and accounts receivable of the borrowers  as defined in the revolving credit facility 
adjustments to reserves booked against these assets  including inventory reserves  will change the eligible borrowing base and thereby impact the liquidity provided by the facility 
the current applicable margins  effective december   for base rate loans and libor loans were and  respectively 
at december   the borrowing base under the revolving credit facility was million  which has been reduced by the commitments or availability under certain foreign credit facilities and an excess availability requirement of million 
there were no borrowings outstanding under this facility at december  see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the senior notes  the revolving credit facility and nmhg s additional borrowings 
both the revolving credit facility and terms of the senior notes include restrictive covenants  which  among other things  limit the payment of dividends to nacco 
the new revolving credit facility also requires nmhg to meet certain financial tests  including  but not limited to  minimum excess availability  maximum capital expenditures  maximum leverage ratio and minimum fixed charge coverage ratio tests 
the borrowers must maintain aggregate excess availability under the revolving credit facility of at least million 
nmhg believes that funds available under the revolving credit facility  other available lines of credit and operating cash flows will provide sufficient liquidity to meet its operating needs and commitments arising during the next twelve months and until the expiration of nmhg s revolving credit facility in may contractual obligations  contingent liabilities and commitments following is a table summarizing the contractual obligations of nmhg item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations nacco industries  inc

the initial proceeds from the senior notes received in were reduced by an original issue discount of million 
the unamortized balance of this discount at december  is million 
therefore  the amount recognized as senior notes in the consolidated balance sheet at december  is million 
an event of default  as defined in the indenture governing nmhg s senior notes  in nmhg s revolving credit facilities  in nmhg s term loan agreements and in nmhg s operating and capital lease agreements  could cause an acceleration of the payment schedule 
no such event of default has occurred under these agreements 
nmhg s pension funding to its us plans is expected to be approximately million in nmhg expects to make payments related to its other postretirement plans 
these plans are not required to be funded in advance  but are pay as you go 
pension and postretirement funding can vary significantly each year due to changes in legislation and the company s significant assumptions 
as a result  pension and postretirement funding has not been included in the table above 
in addition  nmhg has the following commitments  stated at the maximum undiscounted potential liability  at december  total standby recourse obligations guarantees or repurchase obligations total commercial commitments guarantees and standby recourse or repurchase obligations primarily represent contingent liabilities assumed by nmhg to support financing agreements made between nmhg s customers and third party finance companies for the customer s purchase of lift trucks from nmhg 
these contingent liabilities may take the form of guarantees of residual values or standby recourse or repurchase obligations 
for these transactions  nmhg generally retains a perfected security interest in the lift truck  such that nmhg would take possession of the lift truck in the event that nmhg would become liable under the terms of the guarantees or standby recourse or repurchase obligations 
generally  these commitments are due upon demand in the event of default by the customer 
the security interest is normally expected to equal or exceed the amount of the commitment 
to the extent that nmhg would be required to provide funding as a result of these commitments  nmhg believes that the value of its perfected security interest and amounts available under existing credit facilities are adequate to meet these commitments in the foreseeable future 
the amount of the standby recourse or repurchase obligations increase and decrease over time as obligations under existing arrangements expire and new obligations arise in the ordinary course of business 
losses anticipated under the terms of the guarantees or standby recourse or repurchase obligations are not significant and reserves have been provided for such losses in the consolidated financial statements

bellaire  which formerly operated underground coal mines  primarily in the eastern us  is obligated to provide payments to the fund based on the provisions of the coal act 
the fund pays the medical expenses of certain united mine worker retirees 
the company estimates future obligations to the fund in accordance with the coal act based on i the history of annual payments made since  ii an estimate of the number of retirees to be assigned to bellaire  iii an estimate of future medical inflation rates and iv mortality tables 
the accrual for this obligation changes due to changes in these estimates  as well as from results of judicial proceedings and legislation

during  the us court of appeals for the sixth circuit upheld a us district court s ruling which invalidated the social security administration s ssa assignment of certain retired coal miners to bellaire 
this ruling reduced the company s estimate of the total beneficiaries assigned to bellaire as part of the coal act 
during  the us supreme court decided to review circuit court rulings whose decisions in this matter were in conflict 
the u 
s court of appeals for the sixth circuit ruled that the ssa assignments were invalid  while the us court of appeals for the fourth circuit ruled that the ssa assignments were valid 
on january   the us supreme court decided that the initial assignments made after october  are valid despite their untimeliness 
as a result  the company increased its estimate of the number of beneficiaries assigned to bellaire 
however  the effect of the assignment of additional beneficiaries from this decision is offset somewhat by a favorable decision from the us supreme court in that the ssa s assignment of certain retired coal miners to companies defined as successors in interest to a signatory operator no longer in business was not permitted under the coal act 
this decision resulted in a reduction to the estimate of the number of beneficiaries assigned to bellaire

prior to the adoption of sfas no 
 an accrual for these liabilities was estimated and discounted using an applicable risk free rate of return 
as of january   these obligations have been remeasured to their estimated fair market value and discounted using a credit adjusted risk free rate  as required pursuant to sfas no 
this change in the measurement of these liabilities as required pursuant to sfas no 
resulted in a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle adjustment to increase net income  primarily as a result of the change in the discount rate used to measure these liabilities

 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  requires presently enacted changes in relevant laws to be considered in current period measurements of accumulated postretirement benefit obligation apbo and the net postretirement benefit costs 
the fsp addresses the fact that certain accounting issues raised by the act are not explicitly addressed in sfas no 
and significant uncertainties may exist as to the direct effects of the act  as well as the ancillary effects on plan participants behavior and health care costs 
therefore  a plan sponsor and its advisors may not have sufficiently reliable information available to measure the effects of the act  sufficient time before issuance of the financial statements for fiscal years that include the act s enactment to prepare actuarial valuations that reflect the effects of the act  or sufficient guidance to ensure that the sponsor s accounting for the effects of the act is consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states

in addition  nacoal and bellaire closely monitor proposed legislation concerning the clean air act amendments of  reauthorization of the resource conservation and recovery act  the clean water act  the endangered species act and other regulatory actions 
compliance with these increasingly stringent standards could result in higher expenditures for both capital improvements and operating costs 
the company s policies stress environmental responsibility and compliance with these regulations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk on may   nmhg refinanced a majority of its floating rate debt financing with the issuance of senior notes at a fixed rate of interest 
as a result of this refinancing during  nmhg terminated all of its interest rate swap agreements 
the combined notional amount and fair value of the interest rate swap agreements terminated was million and a payable of million  respectively  on the respective dates of termination 
a small portion of nmhg s financing  however  requires interest payments based on floating interest rates 
also in  hbwps terminated certain interest rate swap agreements with a combined notional amount of million and a net payable balance of million on the date of termination 
in addition to the fixed rate debt financing at nmhg  the company s subsidiaries  nacoal  nmhg  hbwps and kci  have entered into certain financing arrangements that require interest payments based on floating interest rates 
as such  the company s financial results are subject to changes in the market rate of interest 
to reduce the exposure to changes in the market rate of interest  the company has entered into interest rate swap agreements for a significant portion of its floating rate financing arrangements 
the company does not enter into interest rate swap agreements for trading purposes 
terms of the interest rate swap agreements require the subsidiaries to receive a variable interest rate and pay a fixed interest rate 
see also note and note to the consolidated financial statements 
for purposes of specific risk analysis  the company uses sensitivity analysis to measure the potential loss in fair value of financial instruments sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the company assumes that a loss in fair value is an increase to its liabilities 
the fair value  based on a market quote  of the company s fixed rate debt  which was issued in  was million at december  assuming a hypothetical decrease in the effective interest yield on this fixed rate debt  the fair value of this liability would increase by million compared with the fair value of this liability at december  the fair value of the company s interest rate swap agreements was a liability of million at december  and million at december  a hypothetical decrease in interest rates as of december  and  would cause an increase in the fair value of interest rate swap agreements liability amount by million and million  respectively  compared with their fair value  which is a liability  at december  and  respectively 
foreign currency exchange rate risk nmhg and hbwps operate internationally and enter into transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
as such  their financial results are subject to the variability that arises from exchange rate movements 
nmhg and hbwps use forward foreign currency exchange contracts to partially reduce risks related to transactions denominated in foreign currencies and not for trading purposes 
these contracts mature within one year and require the companies to buy or sell japanese yen  australian dollars  canadian dollars  mexican pesos  british pound sterling or euros for the functional currency in which the applicable subsidiary operates at rates agreed to at the inception of the contracts 
the fair value of these contracts was a net asset of million and million at december  and  respectively 
see also notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
for purposes of specific risk analysis  the company uses sensitivity analysis to measure the potential loss in fair value of financial instruments sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company assumes that a loss in fair value is either a decrease to its assets or an increase to its liabilities 
assuming a hypothetical strengthening of the us dollar compared with other foreign currencies at december  and  the fair value of foreign currency sensitive financial instruments  which primarily represents forward foreign currency exchange contracts  would decline by million and million compared with their fair value at december  and  respectively 
it is important to note that the loss in fair value indicated in this sensitivity analysis would be somewhat offset by changes in the fair value of the underlying receivables  payables and net investments in foreign subsidiaries 
commodity price risk the company uses certain commodities  including steel  resins  linerboard and diesel fuel  in the normal course of its manufacturing and mining processes 
as such  the cost of operations is subject to variability as the market for these commodities change 
the company monitors this risk and  from time to time  enters into derivative contracts to hedge this risk 
the company does not currently have any such derivative contracts outstanding  nor does the company have any significant purchase obligations to obtain fixed quantities of commodities in the future
