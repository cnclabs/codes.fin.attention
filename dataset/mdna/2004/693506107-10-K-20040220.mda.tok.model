the significant charges in the table above account for million of this change 
the remaining million increase in net income was due to a combination of factors 
the factors causing net income to be higher were higher selling prices in our chemicals segment  higher sales volumes across all of our business segments  the favorable effects of foreign currency translation  primarily from our european operations  improved manufacturing efficiencies and lower overhead costs in our coatings and glass segments  the gain on the sale of certain non strategic assets  including marketable securities  and lower interest expense due to lower debt levels in higher pension and postretirement medical costs across all of our business segments  higher energy costs in our glass and chemicals segments and the negative effects of inflation were factors reducing net income

factors increasing operating income were lower restructuring costs in  the higher sales volumes described above  improved manufacturing efficiencies  the favorable effects of foreign currency translation and lower overhead costs 
factors decreasing operating income were inflationary cost increases and higher pension and postretirement medical costs 
glass sales increased million or in sales increased from improved volumes primarily from our automotive original equipment  automotive replacement glass and flat glass businesses  net of lower volumes from our fiber glass business

other significant factors the company s pretax earnings in included net periodic pension expense of million compared to million in the increase in pension costs is due primarily to a decrease in the market value of pension plan assets through the end of  a reduction in the expected return on plan assets assumption for and the amortization of accumulated actuarial losses

the effective tax rate for was approximately and is expected to be the same for outlook the us economy continued to gain strength in late consumer confidence  buoyed by tax cuts  low interest rates and overall improvements in the us equity markets  improved during the year  particularly during the fourth quarter 
the commercial construction sector remained at very low levels  but has been showing signs of improvement throughout the second half of the year 
increases in industrial production have been positive since july  however  for the full year  growth was only slightly positive 
strong consumer confidence has been a key driver of the current economic recovery  including its impact on automotive sales 
european automotive markets were weak at the beginning of the year but have improved although  as with the us markets  sales were below the high levels of the past few years 
as the new year begins  the economic reports suggest that the us economy is poised for growth  extending the improvement that was seen in the second half of the year 
for  we expect the us economy to settle into a more stable pattern in terms of quarterly gdp growth compared to interest rates should remain at historically low levels much of this year and continue to support economic expansion 
increasing values of stock portfolios are likely to be a positive factor while the benefit from households refinancing their debt is unlikely to provide the same boost as it has during the industrial slowdown of the past few years 
overall global economic growth in is expected to reach its highest level since  possibly exceeding three percent in terms of real gdp growth 
growth in europe is likely to be negatively impacted by the strength of the euro  which hit a new all time high against the us dollar in january of economic growth in south america will probably remain relatively slow compared to most other regions 
the asian market should once again post solid growth  especially in china 
the chinese economy is the fastest growing of the world s ten largest economies  with production of vehicles and consumer goods increasing at significant rates 
while this provides an attractive market for our coatings products  it also encourages expansion of production in the region  which in turn contributes to the downward price pressure on some of our glass and fiber glass businesses  where there is excess global capacity and we compete against products produced in china and other low labor cost markets 
while we have consistently focused on reducing our costs  we continue to be challenged by high and rising costs for employee benefits  particularly pensions and medical 
prior to  our pension income more than offset retiree medical costs 
in pension expense combined with other postretirement benefit costs were nearly million 
this increase in costs results from a combination of the decline in the market value of the company s pension plans assets  due primarily to negative investment returns in the us equity market during  a reduction in our expected future rate of return on pension plan assets  lower discount rate assumption and rising medical costs  particularly for prescription drugs 
this cost increase translates to about per share in lower earnings in compared with while the current low interest rate environment is expected to continue  which raises the present value of future benefit obligations  there was some brighter news in with respect to our us pension plans as a result of an actual return on plan assets for the year of a little more than 
consequently  the underfunded status of these plans was reduced  along with our recorded minimum pension liability 
additionally  even though the plans continue to be underfunded  we will not be required to make a mandatory funding contribution to the us plans under pension benefit guarantee corporation or irs regulations until at least  even if our plan assets stay flat with december levels 
these developments are also good news for pension costs which are currently estimated to be slightly less than those in other postretirement benefit costs  however  in are expected to be about million higher than last year 
this increase in costs does not include the benefit of any anticipated reductions annual report and form k ppg industries  inc 
table of contents management s discussion and analysis as a result of the implementation of the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of the act 
ppg is currently evaluating the provisions of the act and its potential impact to our postretirement medical plans which we believe will ultimately reduce our accumulated postretirement benefit obligation and other postretirement benefit costs 
high natural gas costs in north america continue to be a drag on earnings 
changes in natural gas prices have a significant impact on the operating performance of our chemicals and glass segments 
each one dollar change in the price of natural gas per mmbtu million british thermal units would have a direct impact of approximately million to million on our annual operating costs 
it is difficult to predict future natural gas prices  which continue to be high and volatile 
in order to reduce the risks associated with volatile prices  we use a number of techniques  which include reducing consumption through improved manufacturing processes  switching to alternative fuels and hedging 
as of dec 
  we had hedged approximately ten percent of our anticipated natural gas requirements for at an average price of per mmbtu 
factoring in the expected benefit from these hedges  based on an average cost for january and february of approximately  the average cost for natural gas in the first quarter of would be approximately per mmbtu  or an increase of about over the average cost of natural gas in the first quarter of in  we see the potential for increases in the prices for raw materials used in our coatings businesses  especially as the economic expansion begins to gain momentum 
at the same time the anticipated growth in industrial production may strengthen the end use markets of our chlor alkali customers and support higher ecu prices  which had declined at the end of even though they rose significantly for the full year compared with we expect to remain focused in on serving our customer needs  investing in technology to bring new products to market and reducing our costs 
further  we have a demonstrated track record of generating cash  as evidenced by the billion in cash from operating activities over the time period 
after capital spending  which we have managed tightly  and payment of dividends to our shareholders  we have been directing our cash flow to reduce debt by more than billion over the past three years 
we plan to use our cash in a similar manner in we are well positioned to face the challenges that come our way during we remain confident that our focus on growing revenues while continuously working to improve our manufacturing efficiencies and lower our costs will enable ppg to once again take advantage of economic growth  both in the us and international markets 
accounting standard adopted in effective jan 
  we adopted the fair value method of recording stock based compensation  as defined in statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 for stock options awarded to employees after the date of adoption and for previously issued stock options that were not vested as of jan 
 using the modified prospective transition method 
we expect the impact of adoption to increase stock based compensation expense by approximately million  aftertax  or per share 
this impact reflects the fact that beginning in stock option grants under the ppg stock plan will vest three years after the date of grant 
previously  original grants of stock options under this plan vested after one year 
as a result of this vesting provision and assuming the number of options granted in and and the fair value of those options is comparable to those granted in  the impact of this accounting change will grow to approximately and per share in and  respectively  at which time a full annual run rate of expense is reached 
additionally  under the modified prospective transition method we are required to record a deferred tax asset of million and a corresponding increase to additional paid in capital equal to the deferred tax benefit that would have been recognized in had compensation expense been recorded under the fair value provisions of sfas no

see note  commitments and contingent liabilities  under item of this form k for an expanded description of this case and certain other lawsuits  including the proposed ppg settlement arrangement for asbestos claims announced on may  as discussed in note  although the result of any future litigation of such lawsuits and claims is inherently unpredictable  management believes that  in the aggregate  the outcome of all lawsuits and claims involving ppg  including asbestos related claims in the event the ppg settlement arrangement described in note does not become effective  will not have a material effect on ppg s consolidated financial position or liquidity  however  any such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs  if any  are recognized 
it is ppg s policy to accrue expenses for environmental contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated

impact of inflation ppg s financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis  which does not completely account for the effects of inflation 
in  the increase in production costs due to the negative effects of inflation  including the impact of higher energy costs in our glass and chemicals segments  was offset by the impact of higher selling prices in our chemicals segment and the improved manufacturing efficiencies in our coatings and glass segments 
in  the decline in selling prices and the negative effects of inflation on our production costs were not fully recovered through improved manufacturing efficiencies across all of our businesses and lower raw material and natural gas costs 
in  the increase in production costs due to the negative effects of inflation was not fully recovered through price increases and manufacturing efficiencies  which were adversely impacted by lower production volumes 
in  the expected inflationary and market pressures on costs as well as a decline in selling prices will not be fully recovered by ongoing improvements in manufacturing efficiencies

critical accounting estimates management has evaluated the accounting policies used in the preparation of the financial statements and related notes under item of this form k and believes those policies to be reasonable and appropriate 
we believe that the most critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements relate to accounting for contingencies  under which we accrue a loss when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated  and to accounting for pensions  other postretirement benefits  goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives because of the importance of management judgment in making the estimates necessary to apply these policies 
contingencies  by their nature  relate to uncertainties that require management to exercise judgment both in assessing the likelihood that a liability has been incurred as well as in estimating the amount of potential loss 
the most important contingencies impacting our financial statements are those related to the collectibility of accounts receivable  environmental remediation  pending litigation against the company and the resolution of matters related to open tax years 
for more information on these matters  see note  working capital detail  note  income taxes and note  commitments and contingent liabilities under item of this form k 
accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided well into the future and attributing that cost over the time period each employee works 
to accomplish this  extensive use is made of assumptions about inflation  investment returns  mortality  turnover  medical costs and discount rates 
these assumptions are reviewed annually 
see note  pensions and other postretirement benefits  under item of this form k for information on these plans and the assumptions used 
as discussed in note  summary of significant accounting policies  under item of this form k  the company tests goodwill and identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment at least annually by comparing the fair value of the reporting units to their carrying values 
fair values are estimated using discounted cash flow methodologies that are based on projections of the amounts and timing of future revenues and cash flows 
based on this testing  none of our goodwill was impaired as of dec 
  however  the fair value of our fiber glass business declined during as a result  the related goodwill of million is at risk in for impairment should our projected recovery in this business not occur 
as part of our ongoing financial reporting process  a collaborative effort is undertaken involving ppg managers with functional responsibility for financial  credit  environmental  legal  tax and benefit matters and outside advisors such as consultants  engineers  lawyers and actuaries 
the results of this effort provide management with the necessary information on which to base their judgments on these contingencies and to develop the estimates and assumptions used to prepare the financial statements 
we believe that the amounts recorded in the financial statements under item of this form k related to these contingencies  pensions  other postretirement benefits  goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives are based on the best estimates and judgments of the appropriate ppg management  although actual outcomes could differ from our estimates 
currency during  the us dollar weakened against the currencies of most of the countries in which ppg operates  most notably against the euro  the british pound sterling and the canadian dollar 
the effects of translating the net assets of our operations denominated in non us currencies to the non us dollar increased consolidated net assets by million 
in addition  the weak us dollar had a favorable impact on pretax earnings of approximately million compared to the euro and the british pound sterling strengthened against the us dollar and  respectively  during the effects of translating the net assets and net earnings of our operations denominated in these currencies to the us dollar increased consolidated net assets by approximately million but did not have a significant impact on the results of operations 
this was offset  in part  by the continued devaluation of the argentine peso  which reduced our net investment in argentina by million to a total of million as of dec 
 any reduction in the value of these net assets resulting from a further devaluation of the argentine peso will result in a direct charge to the accumulated other comprehensive loss component of shareholders equity

research and development costs totaled over of sales in each of the past three years  representing a level of expenditure that we expect to continue in these costs include technology driven improvements to our manufacturing processes and customer technical service  as well as the costs of developing new products
