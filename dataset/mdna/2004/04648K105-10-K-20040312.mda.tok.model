item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes in this report 
this report contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those in such forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including those discussed in risk factors  business and elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a leading provider of mobile resource management mrm services  a rapidly growing category of business productivity solutions that enable the effective management of mobile resources 
our mrm services allow customers to improve productivity by enabling the effective management of their mobile workers and assets  and their goods and services 
in addition  our services are designed to allow customers to increase the utility of their mobile resources and decrease costs of operations by facilitating business processes  such as event confirmation  signature verification  forms processing  project management and timekeeping while their workers are in the field 
our services also provide location  reporting  dispatch  messaging  and other management services and are designed to be easy to implement and use 
our customers can manage their mobile workers in several ways  including by logging onto our website  having their data emailed to them  receiving their data directly into their existing software applications  using any wireline or wireless telephone to access our speech to text voice portal or requesting information from our data centers using application programming interfaces 
from july through june  our operations consisted primarily of various start up activities relating to our current business  including development of global positioning system technologies  recruiting personnel and raising capital 
we did not recognize any revenues prior to june  and our expenses consisted of research and development  sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses 
in  we expanded our strategy and redirected our focus to provide location relevant and time sensitive information services and solutions to companies managing mobile resources 
in the second half of  we introduced fleetasap  now called geomanager  a service that leverages existing infrastructure  including the global positioning system  wireless networks and the internet along with integrated transaction processing and software applications  to enable companies to efficiently manage their 
table of contents mobile resources 
subsequent to the introduction of fleetasap  we have introduced a number of additional services  including geomanager pocket edition  road pathway  roadreport  roadforce and connectbusiness  and have added features to our services 
our services provide current and historical data relating to a customer s mobile resources in a variety of formats  including activity reports  maps and completed business forms 
we provide these formats in a standard configuration  and customers can configure certain elements and views themselves to help achieve compliance with their internal business rules 
customers can choose to submit queries to our database to create reports and views on demand or they can have reports delivered on a pre scheduled basis 
customers can also download reports to manipulate and store data as desired 
mobile resource data is typically stored by us for days  unless the customer purchases our extended data storage services 
our services are enabled by the deployment of a device  which we call a platform  to each of the customer s mobile resources 
we call each mobile resource with a platform a subscriber 
our services operate with three independent platforms 
first  a mobile worker can use our proprietary hardware device embedded with software that integrates a gps receiver with a wireless modem 
second  a mobile worker can use our proprietary hardware device embedded with software and an integrated gps receiver and which is tethered by cable to a wireless telephone 
each of these proprietary hardware devices is called an internet location manager 
the internet location manager is installed in a mobile worker s vehicle 
installation in any type of vehicle typically takes less than an hour  and is completed by our subcontracted installation agents 
third  a mobile worker can use a location or wireless application protocol enabled mobile telephone installed with our software application 
these platforms send and receive a variety of information from time to time and on demand 
such data include location  velocity  time and operational diagnostics 
these data are transmitted to our data centers using wireless networks and the internet 
if a wireless connection is not available  then the platform will store up to five days of captured data and seek to transmit the data when a wireless connection is available 
since  we have derived substantially all of our revenues from the sale of our services and the associated product hardware 
our service revenue is comprised of monthly fees 
our customers can contract to receive our services for terms of one  two or three years and can purchase enhanced service features for additional fees 
as more customers use our services  the impact on our service revenue is compounded 
our product revenue consists of sales of the internet location manager  internet data terminal and ruggedized personal digital assistant 
to date  we have not sold our services outside the united states and canada  however  we intend to expand our service offerings to additional countries in the future 
we do not expect that revenues from international sales will be material in in  one customer  verizon communications  represented of total revenues 
no other customers comprised or more of total revenues in in and  no single customer or group of related customers comprised or more of total revenues 
since inception we have invested substantially in research and development  marketing  the building of our sales channels and our overall infrastructure 
we anticipate that such investments may increase in the future 
we incurred losses in each quarter from inception through the quarter ending june   and may incur net losses in the future 
at december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
our limited operating history makes it difficult to forecast future operating results 
we may not sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
in the third quarter of  at t wireless announced that it expects to cease operating its cellular digital packet data network by june  on march   we received a letter dated march  from at t wireless that states that at t wireless will continue to operate its cellular digital packet data network for certain valuable partners  including road  until at least september  the letter further states that this extension of cellular digital packet data network availability extends across all at t wireless geographic locations 
we are currently in discussions with at t wireless and other wireless carriers to minimize any disruption of the provision of our services to 
table of contents subscribers 
on or about the actual termination date of at t wireless cellular digital packet data network and where possible  certain affected subscribers would be transferred to alternate cellular digital packet data networks without a change to the hardware platform then used by those subscribers 
however  we currently estimate that as of september  we will have approximately  subscribers in their initial contract periods that are then using at t wireless cellular digital packet data network and that would need to use an alternate wireless protocol to continue to use our services 
to use an alternate wireless protocol  existing hardware platforms would have to be replaced for these subscribers 
we do not expect to realize a loss on the sale of these replacement hardware platforms 
while there is no assurance  we do not expect that the termination of at t wireless cellular digital packet data network will have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
in its report on form k filed with the sec on march   verizon wireless disclosed that it expects to cease operating its cellular digital packet data network at the end of we estimate that as of december  we will have approximately  subscribers in their initial contract periods that are then using verizon wireless cellular digital packet data network and that would need to use an alternate wireless protocol to continue to use our services 
to use an alternate wireless protocol  existing hardware platforms would have to be replaced for these subscribers 
we do not expect to realize a loss on the sale of these replacement hardware platforms 
while there is no assurance  we do not expect that the termination of verizon wireless cellular digital packet data network will have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
critical accounting policies financial reporting release no 
 which was released by the sec in january  requires all companies to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements 
included in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  included in this report  is a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods we use 
the following is a discussion of the more significant of these policies and methods 
revenue recognition in accordance with applicable accounting standards  including sop no 
 software revenue recognition  as amended  we recognize revenue when earned 
specifically  we recognize revenue when the price is fixed and determinable  upon persuasive evidence of an agreement  when we have fulfilled our obligations under any such agreement and upon a determination that collection is probable 
through december   our services have been available only by using our platform or a location or wireless application protocol enabled mobile telephone 
accordingly  through december   service revenue  which is comprised of monthly fees  was recognized ratably over the minimum service contract period  which commenced a upon installation where customers have installed our platform in mobile worker vehicles or b upon the creation of subscription licenses and a customer account on our website where customers have elected to use our services with a location enabled mobile telephone 
our product revenue primarily consists of sales of the internet location manager  internet data terminal and ruggedized personal digital assistant 
we defer product revenue at installation and recognize it ratably over the minimum service contract period  which generally is two or three years 
renewal rates for our services are not considered priced at a bargain in comparison to the initial sales price of an associated product as described in staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
changes to the pricing of our products and services in the future could result in the recognition of product revenue over periods that extend beyond the minimum service contract period 
historically  the selling prices of our products have often been at or below our costs 
product costs not in excess of related product revenue are deferred at the time of shipment and amortized ratably over the minimum service contract period 
where the selling prices of our products are below our costs  we expense the difference at the time of shipment of the related products 

table of contents allowances for doubtful accounts historically  we have had a significant number of small to medium sized companies utilizing our services 
these customers are involved in diverse businesses 
our payment arrangements with customers generally provide day payment terms 
at the time that customers contract with us for our services  we assess their creditworthiness 
during economic downturns  certain of our customers have had difficulty with their cash flows 
the nature of our relationship with customers is inherently long term and we have extended and may extend payment terms on an exception basis 
we regularly review our customers ability to satisfy their payment obligations and provide an allowance for doubtful accounts for all specific receivables that we believe are not collectible 
when these conditions arise  we suspend recognition of revenue until collection becomes probable or cash is collected 
beyond these specific customer accounts  we record an allowance based on the size and age of all receivable balances against which we have not established a specific allowance 
these allowances are based on our experience in collecting such accounts 
although we believe that we can make reliable estimates for doubtful accounts  the size and diversity of our customer base  as well as overall economic conditions  may affect our ability to accurately estimate revenue and bad debt expense 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
results of operations for the years ending december    and years ended december  in thousands service revenue cost of service revenue excluding amortization included below intangibles amortization stock compensation cost of service revenue total cost of service revenue service gross margin service gross margin percentage service revenue service revenue increased to million in from million and million in and  respectively  as a direct result of the growth in our installed base of subscribers to our services 
the number of subscribers using our services totaled approximately   and  at december   and  respectively 
in addition to subscriber growth  our service revenue is affected by a number of factors  including the rate at which service features or add ons are adopted and pricing associated with the size and term of customer contracts 
given the fixed nature of our arrangements with our customers and ratable revenue recognition  the impact on revenues of changes in current prices for products and services is tempered because revenues from new pricing are layered on top of revenues from existing subscribers 
price changes did not have a material impact on service revenue between periods 
achieved average monthly revenue per subscriber was approximately for  up from in of the increase  approximately was related to adoption of additional service capabilities and features by subscribers 
the remaining increase of approximately was the result of price changes associated with the types of services and size and term of contracts for new subscribers as those new revenues were layered on top of revenues from existing subscribers 
achieved average monthly revenue per subscriber was approximately for  up from for of the increase  approximately was related to adoption of additional service capabilities and features by subscribers 
the remaining increase of approximately was the result of price changes associated with the types of services and size and term of contracts for new subscribers as those new revenues were layered on top of revenues from existing subscribers 

table of contents cost of service revenue excluding intangibles amortization cost of service revenue consists of expenses related to the delivery and support of our services 
direct expenses are comprised of costs associated with connecting our services to wireless networks and the internet and royalty and subscription fees paid to others 
support and other delivery costs include such expenses as employee salaries and related expenses and depreciation of our data centers 
cost of service revenue increased to million in from million in the increase in cost of service revenue resulted from an increase of million in direct service delivery expenses  consistent with growth in our installed base of subscribers  and an increase in employee related costs of  associated with a higher average headcount during the year 
these costs were offset by a reduction in depreciation expense of  as certain assets became fully depreciated 
cost of service revenue increased to million in from million in the increase resulted from an increase in direct service delivery expenses of million  consistent with growth in our installed base of subscribers  offset by reductions in personnel  service infrastructure and travel costs of   and  respectively 
direct expenses generally increase at a rate proportional to the growth in subscribers using our services 
personnel costs and depreciation expense generally increase at a rate slower than the growth rate of subscribers to our services 
as a result  we expect that the growth in service revenue will be greater than the growth in cost of service revenue as we continue to add subscribers 
service gross margin during the year ended december  service gross margins improved to from and in and  respectively  as a result of increased service revenue associated with growth in our installed base of subscribers and a smaller increase in the total cost of service revenue  including intangibles amortization 
the average number of subscribers to our services increased in over and in over cost of service revenue includes fixed indirect expenses and  therefore  generally increases at rates slower than the growth in our installed base of subscribers 
years ended december  in thousands product revenue cost of product revenue stock compensation cost of product revenue total cost of product revenue product gross deficit product gross deficit percentage product revenue product revenue increased  and over each prior year in  and  respectively 
this growth is consistent with the growth in our installed base of subscribers 
as new subscribers are added to our installed base  the amount of both deferred revenue and deferred costs recognized ratably over the minimum service contract period increases 
upon completion of the initial term of a customer s contract  recognition of both deferred product revenue and product cost is complete 
customers may then renew their agreements for future services without the purchase of new hardware and  therefore  we anticipate that product revenue will grow more slowly than service revenue 
cost of product revenue cost of product revenue consists of the cost of the internet location manager  internet data terminal  ruggedized personal digital assistant and related parts  costs associated with the final assembly  test  provisioning  delivery and installation of our products  and other costs such as provisions for inventory and repair costs 
product costs not in excess of related product revenue are deferred at the time of 
table of contents shipment and amortized ratably over the minimum service contract period 
where the selling prices of our products are below our costs  we expense the difference at the time of shipment of the related products 
generally  we expect the selling prices of our products to be approximately equal to or exceed the product costs in future periods 
the impact of selling products below our cost on future cash flow from operations is expected to be minimal 
as new subscribers are added to our installed base  the amount of both deferred revenue and deferred costs recognized ratably increases 
upon completion of the initial term of a customer s contract  recognition of both deferred product revenue and product cost is complete 
customers may then renew their agreements for future services without the purchase of new hardware and  therefore  we anticipate that product revenue and cost of product revenue will grow more slowly than service revenue 
cost of product revenue rose to million in from million in the increase in cost of product revenue resulted from an increase in product repair and refurbishment costs of  an increase in deferred product cost recognized during the period of  increases in employee related costs of  and an increase in provisions for inventory valuation of  cost of product revenue rose to million in from million in the increase in cost of product revenue resulted from a million increase in deferred product cost recognized during the period  consistent with the growth in subscribers using our services  and increased employee related expenses of  product gross deficit product gross deficit improved to in from in and from in increases in product revenue from deferrals associated with the growth in our installed base of subscribers were greater than the related increases in product costs from deferrals 
other costs  including repair expenses  provisions for inventory valuation and the loss recognized on the excess of product cost over product revenue also increased between  and while we expect the selling prices of our products to be approximately equal to or to exceed product costs in future periods  after considering other costs  such as those described in cost of product revenue above  we do not expect to generate significant product gross margin during the next twelve months 
sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses consist of employee salaries  sales commissions  and marketing and promotional expenses 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million in from million in the increase was the result of higher employee related costs of million  associated with higher average headcount during  offset by decreases in depreciation of  as certain assets became fully depreciated and decreases in travel expenses of  sales and marketing headcount decreased to at december  from at december  we expect that sales and marketing expenses will increase as we expand our sales and marketing efforts  including  but not limited to  modest headcount growth and promotional expenses related to new product and service offerings 
sales and marketing expenses decreased to million in from million in the reduction in expenses was attributed to lower average headcount and the associated decline in compensation expense of million and reductions in promotional expenses of million  consistent with our cost control initiatives across the company 
sales and marketing headcount increased to at december  from at december  research and development expenses research and development expenses consist of employee salaries and expenses related to development personnel and consultants  as well as expenses associated with software and hardware development 
research and development expenses decreased to million in from million in the reduction in expense is attributed to decreases in depreciation of  as certain assets became fully depreciated during the year  decreases in indirect allocated costs of  and decreases in employee related costs of  associated with a decrease in the average headcount 
headcount decreased to at december  
table of contents from at december  we anticipate that research and development expenses will increase in future periods as we develop and introduce new products and services  including modest increases in consultant and employee related expenses associated with those introductions 
research and development expenses decreased to million in from million in  as a result of reductions in employee related expenses of million and consultant expenses of  headcount decreased to at december  from at december  after development of our initial service and product offerings was completed  certain personnel and consultants related to those initial introductions were no longer required 
as a result  research and development expenses declined in connection with those headcount reductions 
in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  or sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use  we capitalize qualifying computer software costs that are incurred during the application development stage and amortize them over the software s estimated useful life 
during  and  no research and development costs were capitalized in accordance with sop general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist of employee salaries and related expenses for executive and administrative costs  accounting and professional fees  recruiting costs and provisions for doubtful accounts 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in the increase resulted from higher employee related expenses of  related to growth in average headcount during the year  increases in corporate and other tax expenses of  increases in professional fees of  and a rise in general operating expenses such as insurance and bank fees of  these increases were consistent with our anticipated expenditures associated with our growth and were offset in part by a decrease in the provision for doubtful accounts of  we expect that general and administrative expenses will increase in future periods  including modest increases in employee related expenses and professional fees associated with our operation as a public company 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million in from million in the decrease in was the result of reductions in provision for doubtful accounts of million  decreases in employee related expenses of  attributed to lower average headcount in  reduced consultant charges of  and reduced legal fees of  these reductions  with the exception of the provisions for doubtful accounts  were consistent with our cost control initiatives across the company 
provisions for doubtful accounts decreased to  in from  in and from million in  due to improved collection activity and receivables management 
we expect that provisions for doubtful accounts may increase because of the non recurring nature of favorable adjustments that occurred during and  however  we do not expect that these provisions will return to the levels reported in general and administrative headcount totaled  and at december    and  respectively 
restructuring charges during  in response to a general downturn in the economy  we undertook a formal plan to lower our cost structure 
we completed a reorganization to more effectively develop  market and sell mobile resource management products and services 
this effort resulted in the total number of employees being reduced by approximately percent 
restructuring expenses  which consist of severance and related costs  were  in 
table of contents intangibles amortization intangibles amortization relates to the intangible assets purchased from differential corrections  inc in april and connectbusiness 
com  inc in september the costs are being amortized over an estimated useful life of three and two years  respectively 
stock compensation expense deferred stock compensation related to the granting of stock options to employees and consultants was approximately  at december  and  as of december  stock compensation expense decreased to  in from million in and million in  and primarily represents the amortization of deferred stock compensation over the vesting periods of related options granted in and investment impairment charge at december   we held approximately  shares of preferred stock in cellport systems  inc  with a book value of  which represented approximately seven percent ownership in cellport systems  inc we accounted for this investment using the cost method 
during  we determined that the investment had experienced a decline in value that was other than temporary 
accordingly  we expensed  in interest income expense  net net interest income expense is composed primarily of interest earned on cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  partially offset by interest expense related to the financing of directors and officers insurance costs 
net interest income expense decreased to approximately  in from  and million in and  respectively 
the decreases resulted from lower balances available for investment and lower interest rates 
other expense  net in  and other expense consisted primarily of immaterial net foreign currency exchange losses related to our subsidiary in india 
income taxes through  we incurred net losses for federal and state tax purposes and except for only minimum state income and franchise taxes have not recognized any tax provision or benefit 
the net income was offset by the utilization of prior years net operating losses  therefore no income tax expense was provided 
net income loss net income loss increased to million in from million in total revenues increased to million in from million in  while operating costs increased at a slower rate to million in from million in specifically  cost of revenue  sales and marketing expenses  and general and administrative expenses grew modestly  while amortization of intangibles and research and development expenses declined 
generally  we expect that our revenues will grow at a faster rate than our operating expenses 
net loss decreased to million in from million in  the result of increases in revenue accompanied by decreases in operating costs 
specifically  cost of revenue grew more slowly than total revenues while stock compensation  sales and marketing expenses  research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses all declined 

table of contents changing prices we conduct operations primarily within the us where inflation during  and has been low and has not materially impacted our operating results 
foreign currency exchange losses resulting from transactions with our wholly owned subsidiary in india  which began business in  were not material during  and and were expensed as incurred 
quarterly results of operations the following table presents certain unaudited consolidated statement of operations data for our eight most recent fiscal quarters 
the information for each of these quarters is unaudited and has been prepared on the same basis as our audited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report 
in the opinion of our management  all necessary adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  have been included to present fairly the unaudited quarterly results when read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere or incorporated by reference in this report 
we believe that results of operations for interim periods should not be relied upon as any indication of the results to be expected or achieved in any future period or any fiscal year as a whole 
certain quarterly amounts presented below for have been reclassified to conform with the presentation 
quarters ended december  september  june  march  december  september  june  march  in thousands consolidated statements of operations data revenues services product total revenues costs and expenses cost of service revenue cost of product revenue intangibles amortization sales and marketing research and development general and administrative stock compensation total costs and expenses income loss from operations other income expense  net interest income interest expense investment impairment charge other income expense  net total other income expense  net net income loss liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents  million of short term investments and working capital of million 
we currently have a  revolving line of 
table of contents credit facility against which there were no borrowings as of december  the line of credit expires december  net cash provided by used in operating activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in  this improvement in cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributed to net income  net of non cash expenses and charges depreciation and amortization  provision for inventory valuation  amortization of deferred stock compensation  loss on disposal of property and equipment and provisions for doubtful accounts 
cash provided by operating activities during also increased in comparison to the prior year due to increases in deferred revenue  accounts payable  accrued and other liabilities  and reductions in inventory  offset by increases in deferred product costs 
in  cash used for operating activities increased in comparison to the prior year due to increases in accounts receivable and deferred product costs  offset by an increase in deferred revenue 
in  cash used for operating activities was also attributable to increases in accounts receivable  inventory  and deferred product costs  offset in part by increases in deferred revenue 
improvements in accounts receivable collections as compared to increases in customer billings also contributed to increased operating cash flows in both and as of december   approximately million of our accounts receivable were over days old 
we believe we have adequately provided allowances as of december  for any such amounts that may ultimately become uncollectible 
net cash used in investing activities was million in and resulted from the purchase of property and equipment and other assets of million  offset by the net cash proceeds from purchases and sales of short term investments of  net cash used in investing activities was  in and resulted from purchases of  of property and equipment and other assets of  net cash provided by investing activities in was million  primarily resulting from maturities of short term investments of million and offset in part by purchases of approximately  of property and equipment

net cash provided by financing activities was million and million in and  respectively 
cash provided by financing activities in and was primarily attributable to proceeds from the issuance of our stock 
our capital expenditures in increased to million from  in and  in our capital expenditures have been consistent with our anticipated needs in operations  infrastructure and personnel 
we have no material commitments for capital expenditures  although we anticipate increases in capital expenditures and lease commitments with our expected growth in operations and infrastructure over the next twelve months 
we also may establish additional operations as we expand globally 
the following table represents our future commitments under minimum annual lease payments and non cancellable purchase commitments as of december  in thousands less than more than total year years years years non cancellable operating lease commitments non cancellable inventory purchase commitments other long term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet as of december  include a deferred rent liability of  the payments related to this amount are included in non cancellable operating lease commitments above 

table of contents we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for operating expenses  working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next eighteen months 
if cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or to obtain a larger credit facility 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of debt securities  holders of these securities could have certain rights  preferences and privileges senior to holders of our common stock  and the terms of this debt could restrict our operations 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in additional dilution to our existing stockholders  and we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain additional financing  we may be required to reduce the scope of our operations  which could harm our business  financial condition and operating results 
impact of recently issued accounting standards the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation fin  consolidation of variable interest entities in january  and a revised interpretation of fin fin r 
fin requires certain variable interest entities vies to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
the provisions of fin are effective immediately for all arrangements entered into after january  we have not invested in any entities that we believe are variable interest entities for which we are the primary beneficiary 
the adoption of fin had no impact  and we do not expect the adoption of fin r to have an impact  on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows

risk factors in addition to the other information contained in this report  the following factors should be carefully considered in evaluating our business and prospects 
the risks and uncertainties described below are intended to be ones that are specific to us or our industry and that we deem material  but they are not the only ones that we face 
if  pursuant to its announcement  at t wireless ceases to operate its cellular digital packet data network in  we may lose subscribers and our revenues could decrease 
beginning march   at t wireless discontinued new sales of cellular digital packet data service 
at t wireless has also indicated that it expects to cease operating its cellular digital packet data network by september  if the termination of at t wireless cellular digital packet data network disrupts our ability to deliver services to certain of our customers and we are unable to transition those customers to other networks  our revenues would decrease and customer satisfaction would suffer 

table of contents if  pursuant to its announcement  verizon wireless ceases to operate its cellular digital packet data network by the end of  we may lose subscribers and our revenues could decrease 
verizon wireless has indicated that it expects to cease operating its cellular digital packet data network by the end of if the termination of verizon wireless cellular digital packet data network disrupts our ability to deliver services to certain of our customers and we are unable to transition those customers to other networks  our revenues would decrease and customer satisfaction would suffer 
if wireless carriers on which we depend for services decide to abandon or do not continue to expand their wireless networks  we may lose subscribers and our revenues could decrease 
currently our services function on general packet radio services networks  code division multiple access xrtt networks  integrated digital enhanced networks and cellular digital packet data networks 
these protocols cover only portions of the united states and canada  and may not gain widespread market acceptance 
if wireless carriers abandon these protocols in favor of other types of wireless technology  we may not be able to provide services to our customers 
in addition  if wireless carriers do not expand their coverage areas  we will be unable to meet the needs of customers who may wish to use some of our services outside the current coverage area 
our quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuations  and our stock price may decline if we do not meet the expectations of investors and analysts 
our quarterly revenues and operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors  many of which are outside our control 
these factors include  but are not limited to changes in the market for mobile resource management services  delays in market acceptance or implementation by customers of our services  changes in length of sales cycles of or demand by our customers for existing and additional services  changes in the productivity of our distribution channels  introduction of new services by us or our competitors  changes in our pricing policies or those of our competitors or suppliers  changes in our mix of sources of revenues  general economic and political conditions  wireless networks  positioning systems and internet infrastructure owned and controlled by others  and any need to migrate to new wireless networks  which could cause our products to be incompatible with new wireless networks or out of date 
our expense levels are based  in part  on our expectation of future revenues 
additionally  a substantial portion of our expenses is relatively fixed 
as a result  any shortfall in revenues relative to our expectations could cause significant changes in our operating results from quarter to quarter 
we believe period to period comparisons of our revenue levels and operating results are not meaningful 
you should not rely on our quarterly revenues and operating results to predict our future performance 
in some future quarter our operating results may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors and  as a result  the price of our common stock may fall 

table of contents if we cannot deliver the features and functionality our customers demand  we will be unable to retain or attract new customers 
our success depends upon our ability to determine the features and functionality our customers demand and to design and implement services that meet their needs in an efficient manner 
we cannot assure you that we can successfully determine customer requirements or that our future services will adequately satisfy customer demands 
in addition  we may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development  introduction or marketing of new services and service enhancements 
if we cannot effectively deploy  maintain and enhance our services  our revenues may decrease  we may not be able to recover our costs and our competitive position may be harmed 
if our customers do not have access to sufficient capacity on reliable wireless networks  we may be unable to deliver our services  we may lose subscribers  and our revenues could decrease 
our ability to grow and achieve profitability depends on the ability of wireless carriers to provide sufficient network capacity  reliability and security to our customers 
even where wireless carriers provide coverage to entire metropolitan areas  there are occasional lapses in coverage  for example due to tunnels blocking the transmission of data to and from wireless modems used with our services 
these effects could make our services less reliable and less useful  and customer satisfaction could suffer 
if one or more of the agreements we have with wireless carriers is terminated and as a result we are unable to offer services to our customers within a carrier s coverage area  we may be unable to deliver our services  we may lose subscribers  and our revenues could decrease 
our existing agreements with wireless carriers may in some cases be terminated immediately upon the occurrence of certain conditions or with prior written notice 
in connection with ceasing operation of their cellular digital packet data networks  at t wireless and or verizon wireless may seek to terminate or not to renew their contracts for cellular digital packet data service with us 
if one or more of our wireless carriers decides to terminate or not to renew its contract with us  we may incur additional costs relating to obtaining alternate coverage from another wireless carrier outside of its primary coverage area  or we may be unable to replace the coverage at all  causing a complete loss of services to our customers in that coverage area 
we may establish alliances or acquire technologies or companies in the future  which could result in the dilution of our stockholders and disruption of our business  which could reduce our revenues 
we are continually evaluating business alliances and external investments in technologies related to our business 
acquisitions of companies  divisions of companies  businesses or products and strategic alliances entail numerous risks  any of which could materially harm our business in several ways  including diversion of management s attention from our core business objectives and other business concerns  failure to integrate efficiently businesses or technologies acquired in the future with our pre existing business or technologies  potential loss of key employees from either our pre existing business or the acquired business  dilution of our existing stockholders as a result of issuing equity securities  and assumption of liabilities of the acquired company 
some or all of these problems may result from current or future alliances  acquisitions or investments 
furthermore  we may not realize any value from these alliances  acquisitions or investments 

table of contents we face competition from internal development teams of potential customers and from existing and potential competitors  which could limit our ability to acquire subscribers and could reduce our market share and revenues 
the market for our services is competitive and is expected to become even more competitive in the future 
our customers evaluate our services and those of our competitors primarily on the basis of the functionality  ease of use  quality  price  geographic coverage of services and corporate financial strength 
as the demand by businesses for mobile resource management services increases  the quality  functionality and breadth of competing products and services will likely improve and new competitors will likely enter our market 
in addition  the widespread adoption of industry standards may make it easier for new market entrants or existing competitors to improve their existing services  to offer some or all of the services we offer or may offer in the future  or to offer new services that we do not offer 
we also do not know to what extent network infrastructure developers and wireless network operators will seek to provide integrated wireless communications  global positioning system  software applications  transaction processing and internet solutions  including access devices developed internally or through captive suppliers 
if we are unable to compete successfully  it may harm our business  which in turn may limit our ability to acquire or retain subscribers  resulting in a loss of market share and revenues 
we face competition from a number of different business productivity solutions  including solutions developed internally by our prospective customers information technology staffs  discrete means of communication with mobile workers  such as pagers  two way radios  handheld devices and wireless telephones  solutions targeted at specific vertical markets  such as services offered by qualcomm that monitor assets in the long haul transportation sector  and solutions offered by smaller market entrants 
many of our existing and potential competitors have substantially greater financial  technical  marketing and distribution resources than we do 
additionally  many of these companies have greater name recognition and more established relationships with our target customers 
furthermore  these competitors may be able to adopt more aggressive pricing policies and offer customers more attractive terms than we can 
we have a history of losses  have only recently become profitable and may not sustain or increase profitability in the future 
we have only recently become profitable and may not sustain or increase profitability in the future 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
to sustain profitability we will need to generate significant revenues to offset our cost of revenues and our sales and marketing  research and development and general and administrative expenses 
we may not achieve or sustain our revenue or profit goals and our losses may increase in the future 
to facilitate the sale of our services  we have sold and may sell our hardware below our costs 
as a result  we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  negative gross margins on the sale of our hardware 
changes such as increases in our pricing for products and services or the pricing of competing products and services may harm our ability to increase sales of our products and services to new and existing customers 
if we are not able to expand our customer base and increase our revenue from new and existing customers  we may be unprofitable 
due to our limited operating history  it is difficult to predict future operating results or our stock price 
an evaluation of our business is difficult because we have a limited operating history 
we commenced operations in july and commercially offered our first services in the second half of we may not 
table of contents continue to achieve profitability or continue to grow 
we face a number of risks encountered by companies in the mobile resource management market  including our need to respond to technological change and introduce reliable and robust products and services that meet the demanding needs of customers  the uncertainty of market acceptance of our services  our need to expand and manage the expansion of our marketing  sales and support organizations  as well as our distribution channels  our ability to anticipate and respond to market competition  wireless networks  positioning systems and internet infrastructure owned and controlled by others  and any need to migrate to new wireless networks  which could result in our products being incompatible with new wireless networks or out of date 
we may not successfully address these risks  and our business strategy may not be successful 
we have limited resources and may be unable to manage our anticipated growth in operations 
if we fail to develop and maintain our services as we experience rapid growth  demand for our services could decrease  which would result in a decrease in our revenues 
our development and expansion have placed  and will continue to place  significant strain on our managerial  operational and financial resources 
due to the limited deployment of our services  we are unable to assess our ability to grow the business and manage a substantially larger number of customers and additional services 
we depend on a limited number of third parties to manufacture and supply critical components for our products and services 
we rely on sole suppliers and manufacturers for a number of key components for these products and do not have long term agreements with any of these suppliers or manufacturers 
if these parties do not perform their obligations  or if they cease to manufacture and supply components critical for our products and services  we may be unable to find other suppliers or operate our business 
we cannot be sure that alternative sources for key components used in our products  such as the internet location manager and the internet data terminal  will be available when needed  or if available  that these components will be available on commercially reasonable terms 
our sole suppliers and manufacturers of key components include orient semiconductor electronics  our sole manufacturer of internet location managers  motorola  our sole supplier of wireless modems operable on integrated digital enhanced networks and of microcontrollers for our internet location manager  and taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company  our sole manufacturer of our gps digital receiver chips 
if our agreements with these or other suppliers and manufacturers are terminated or expire  if we are unable to obtain sufficient quantities of components critical for our products and services  if the quality of these components is inadequate  or if the terms for supply of these components become commercially unreasonable  our search for additional or alternate suppliers and manufacturers could result in significant delays  added expense and our inability to maintain or expand our subscriber base 
any of these events could require us to take unforeseen actions or devote additional resources to provide our products and services and could harm our ability to compete effectively 

table of contents a disruption of our services due to accidental or intentional security breaches may harm our reputation  cause a loss of revenues and increase our expenses 
unauthorized access  computer viruses and other accidental or intentional actions could disrupt our information systems or communications networks 
we expect to incur significant costs to protect against the threat of security breaches and to alleviate problems caused by any breaches 
currently  the wireless transmission of our customers proprietary information is not protected by encryption technology 
if a third party were to misappropriate our customers proprietary information  we could be subject to claims  litigation or other potential liabilities that could seriously harm our revenues and result in the loss of customers 
system or network failures could reduce our sales  increase costs or result in liability claims 
any disruption to our services  information systems or communications networks or those of third parties could result in the inability of our customers to receive our services for an indeterminate period of time 
our operations depend upon our ability to maintain and protect our computer systems at our co located data centers in ashburn  virginia and redwood city  california  which is on or near earthquake fault zones 
our services may not function properly if our systems fail  or if there is an interruption in the supply of power  or if there is an earthquake  fire  flood or other natural disaster  or an act of war or terrorism 
within each of our data centers  we have fully redundant systems  however  in the event of a system or network failure  the process of shifting access to customer data from one data center to the other would be performed manually  and could result in a further disruption to our services 
any disruption to our services could cause us to lose customers or revenue  or face litigation  customer service or repair work that would involve substantial costs and distract management from operating our business 
we depend on global positioning system technology owned and controlled by others 
if we do not have continued access to gps technology or satellites  we will be unable to deliver our services and revenues will decrease 
our services rely on signals from global positioning system satellites built and maintained by the us department of defense 
gps satellites and their ground support systems are subject to electronic and mechanical failures and sabotage 
if one or more satellites malfunction  there could be a substantial delay before they are repaired or replaced  if at all  and our services may cease to function and customer satisfaction would suffer 
in addition  the us government could decide not to continue to operate and maintain gps satellites over a long period of time or to charge for the use of the global positioning system 
furthermore  because of ever increasing commercial applications of the global positioning system and international political unrest  us government agencies may become increasingly involved in the administration or the regulation of the use of gps signals in the future 
if factors such as the foregoing affect the global positioning system  for example by affecting the availability  quality  accuracy or pricing of gps technology  our business will suffer 
defects or errors in our services could result in the cancellation or delays of our services  which would damage our reputation and harm our financial condition 
we must develop our services quickly to keep pace with the rapidly changing mrm market 
products and services that address this market are likely to contain undetected errors or defects  especially when first introduced or when new versions are introduced 
our services may not be free from errors or defects  which could result in the cancellation or disruption of our services or dissatisfaction of customers 
this would damage our reputation and result in lost revenues  diverted development resources  and increased service and warranty costs 

table of contents the reporting of inaccurate location relevant information could cause the loss of customers and expose us to legal liability 
the accurate reporting of location relevant information is critical to our customers businesses 
if we fail to accurately report location relevant information  we could lose customers  our reputation and ability to attract new customers could be harmed  and we could be exposed to legal liability 
we may not have insurance adequate to cover losses we may incur as a result of these inaccuracies 
our success and ability to compete depends upon our ability to secure and protect patents  trademarks and other proprietary rights 
our success depends on our ability to protect our proprietary rights to the technologies used to implement and operate our services in the united states and in foreign countries 
in the event that a third party breaches the confidentiality provisions or other obligations in one or more of our agreements or misappropriates or infringes on our intellectual property or the intellectual property licensed to us by third parties  our business would be seriously harmed 
to protect our proprietary rights  we rely on a combination of trade secrets  confidentiality and other contractual provisions and agreements  and patent  copyright and trademark laws  which afford us only limited protection 
third parties may independently discover or invent competing technologies or reverse engineer our trade secrets  software or other technology 
furthermore  laws in some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
therefore  the measures we take to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate 
claims that we infringe third party proprietary rights could result in significant expenses or restrictions on our ability to provide our services 
third parties may claim that our current or future products or services infringe their proprietary rights or assert other claims against us 
as the number of entrants into our market increases  the possibility of an intellectual property or other claim against us grows 
any intellectual property or other claim  with or without merit  would be time consuming and expensive to litigate or settle and could divert management attention from focusing on our core business 
as a result of such a dispute  we may have to pay damages  incur substantial legal fees  develop costly non infringing technology  if possible  or enter into license agreements  which may not be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
any of these results would increase our expenses and could decrease the functionality of our services  which would make our services less attractive to our current or potential customers 
we have agreed in some of our agreements  and may agree in the future  to indemnify other parties for any expenses or liabilities resulting from claimed infringements of the proprietary rights of third parties 
from time to time  we are or may be subject to litigation that could result in significant costs to us 
from time to time  we are or may be subject to litigation in the ordinary course of business relating to any number or type of claims  including claims for damages related to errors and malfunctions of our services or hardware platforms or their deployment 
a securities  product liability or other claim could seriously harm our business because of the costs of defending the lawsuit  diversion of employees time and attention  and potential damage to our reputation 
some of our agreements with our customers  suppliers and other third parties contain provisions designed to limit exposure to potential claims 
limitation of liability provisions contained in our agreements may not be enforceable under the laws of some jurisdictions 
as a result  we could be required to pay substantial amounts of damages in settlement or upon the determination of any of these types of claims 
although we carry general liability and directors and officers insurance  our insurance may not cover potential claims or may not be adequate to cover all costs incurred in defense of potential claims or to indemnify us for all liability that may be imposed 

table of contents our success depends on our ability to maintain and expand our sales channels 
to increase our market awareness  customer base and revenues  we need to expand our direct and indirect sales operations 
there is strong competition for qualified sales personnel  and we may not be able to attract and retain sufficient new sales personnel to expand our operations 
new sales personnel require training and it takes time for them to achieve full productivity  if at all 
in addition  we believe that our success is dependent on expansion of our indirect distribution channels  including our relationships with wireless carriers  independent sales agents and distribution partners 
to date  we have relationships with wireless carriers  independent sales agents and a limited number of distribution partners 
these sales channel partners require training in selling our products and services and it will take time for these partners to achieve productivity  if at all 
we may not be able to establish relationships with additional distributors on a timely basis  or at all 
our distributors  many of which are not engaged with us on an exclusive basis  may not devote adequate resources to promoting and selling our services 
we depend on recruiting and retaining qualified personnel and our inability to do so may cause a loss in sales  impair our ability to effectively manage our operations or impair our ability to develop and support services and products 
because of the technical nature of our services and the market in which we compete  our success depends on the continued services of our current executive officers and our ability to attract and retain qualified sales and other personnel with expertise in wireless communications  global positioning systems  hosted software applications  transaction processing and the internet 
competitors and others have in the past  and may attempt in the future  to recruit our employees and encourage our former employees to solicit business from our customers 
in addition  new employees generally require substantial training  which requires significant resources and management attention 
even if we invest significant resources to recruit  train and retain qualified personnel  we may not be successful in our efforts 
government regulations and standards could subject us to increased regulation  increase our costs of operations or reduce our opportunities to earn revenue 
in addition to regulations applicable to businesses in general  we may also be subject to direct regulation by us governmental agencies  including the federal communications commission and department of defense 
these regulations may impose licensing requirements  privacy safeguards relating to certain subscriber information  or safety standards  for example with respect to human exposure to electromagnetic radiation and signal leakage 
a number of legislative and regulatory proposals under consideration by federal  state  provincial  local and foreign governmental organizations may lead to laws or regulations concerning various aspects of the internet  wireless communications and gps technology  including on line content  user privacy  taxation  access charges and liability for third party activities 
additionally  it is uncertain how existing laws governing issues such as taxation on the use of wireless networks  intellectual property  libel  user privacy and property ownership will be applied to our services 
the adoption of new laws or the application of existing laws may expose us to significant liabilities and additional operational requirements  which could decrease the demand for our services and increase our cost of doing business 
wireless carriers who supply us with airtime are subject to regulation by the federal communications commission  and regulations that affect them could also increase our costs or limit the provision of our services 
fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies could result in increased product costs and operating expenses 
we have suppliers and manufacturers that are located outside the united states 
some transactions relating to supply and development agreements may be conducted in currencies other than the us dollar  and fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar could cause us to incur currency exchange costs 
in addition  some of our transactions denominated in us dollars may be subject to currency exchange rate risk 
we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on our future operating results 
should there be a sustained increase in average exchange rates for the local currencies in 
table of contents these countries  our suppliers and manufacturers may request a price increase at the end of the contract period 
geopolitical  economic and military conditions  including terrorist attacks and other acts of war  may materially and adversely affect the markets on which our common stock trades  the markets in which we operate  our operations and our profitability 
terrorist attacks and other acts of war  and any response to them  may lead to armed hostilities and such developments would likely cause instability in financial markets 
armed hostilities and terrorism may directly impact our facilities  personnel and operations that are located in the united states and india  as well as those of our clients 
furthermore  severe terrorist attacks or acts of war may result in temporary halts of commercial activity in the affected regions  and may result in reduced demand for our products 
these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business and the trading price of our common stock 
our stock price is volatile  which may cause you to lose money and could lead to costly litigation against us that could divert our resources 
over the past several years  stock markets have experienced dramatic price and volume fluctuations  particularly for shares of technology companies 
these fluctuations can be unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
broad market fluctuations may reduce the market price of our common stock and cause you to lose some or all of your investment 
these fluctuations may be exaggerated if the trading volume of our common stock is low 
in addition  due to the technology intensive nature and growth rate of our business and the mobile resource management market  the market price of our common stock may rise and fall in response to quarterly variations in operating results  failure to achieve operating results anticipated by securities analysts and investors  changes in estimates of our financial performance or changes in recommendations by securities analysts  announcements of technological or competitive developments  the gain or loss of a significant customer or order  disposition of shares of our common stock held by large investors  and acquisitions or strategic alliances by us or our competitors 
when the market price of a company s stock drops significantly  stockholders often institute securities class action lawsuits against that company 
a lawsuit against us could cause us to incur substantial costs and could divert the time and attention of our management and other resources from our business 
as of february   a limited number of stockholders own approximately of our stock and may act  or prevent certain types of corporate actions  to the detriment of other stockholders 
our directors  officers and greater than stockholders own  as of february   approximately of our outstanding common stock 
accordingly  these stockholders may  if they act together  exercise significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election of a majority of the directors and the determination of significant corporate actions 
this concentration could also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control that could otherwise be beneficial to our stockholders 

table of contents our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and state law contain provisions that could discourage a takeover 
we have adopted a certificate of incorporation and bylaws  which in addition to state law  may discourage  delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a stockholder may consider favorable 
these provisions include the following establishing a classified board in which only a portion of the total board members will be elected at each annual meeting  authorizing the board to issue preferred stock  prohibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors  limiting the persons who may call special meetings of stockholders  prohibiting stockholder action by written consent  and establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange we transact business primarily in us dollars 
we are subject  however  to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates in those countries where we conduct business 
to date  the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on expenses has not been material 
operating expenses incurred by our subsidiary in india are denominated in indian rupees 
this subsidiary was formed in november to perform research and development activities 
we hold fixed price agreements denominated in us dollars with key foreign based suppliers orient semiconductor electronics  in taiwan  manufactures the internet location manager  sierra wireless  in canada  provides the modem for some versions of the internet location manager  taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company  in taiwan  manufactures our global positioning system digital receiver chips  and micronet  in israel  supplies our internet data terminal 
should there be a sustained increase in average exchange rates for the local currency in any of the foregoing countries  our suppliers may request increased pricing on any new agreements 
if this were to occur for all of these currencies and with each of these suppliers  a percent increase in average exchange rates could increase our product costs by approximately percent 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes  nor do we currently hedge any foreign currency exposure to offset the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates 
similarly  we do not use financial instruments to hedge operating expenses of our subsidiary in india
