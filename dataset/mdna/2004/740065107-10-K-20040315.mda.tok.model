item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview of the company s financial model the company is in one line of business the marketing of legal expense and other complimentary plans primarily through a multi level marketing force to individuals 
the company s principal revenues are derived from membership fees  and to a much lesser extent  revenues from marketing associates 
the company s principal expenses are commissions  membership benefits  associates services and direct marketing costs and general and administrative expense 
the following table reflects the changes in these categories of revenues and expenses in the last years dollar amounts in s change change change of from of from of from total prior total prior total prior revenue year revenue year revenue year revenues membership fees    associate services    other    costs and expenses commissions    membership benefits    associate services and direct marketing    general and administrative    other  net    provision for income taxes    loss from operations of discontinued ufl segment net income    the number of active memberships in force and the average monthly fee will directly determine membership fees and their impact on total revenues during any period 
the two most important variables impacting the number of active memberships during a period are the number of new memberships written during the period combined with the retention characteristics of both new and existing memberships 
see measures of member retention below for a discussion of the company s membership retention 
associate services revenues are a function of the number of new sales associates enrolled and the price of entry during the period  the number of associates subscribing to the company s eservice offering and the amount of sales tools purchased by the sales force 
membership benefits expense is primarily determined by the number of active memberships and the per capita contractual rate that exists between the company and its benefits providers and during the last five years has been and is expected to continue to be a relatively fixed percentage of membership revenues of approximately 
commissions paid to associates are primarily dependent on the number and price of new memberships sold during a period and any special incentives that may be in place during the period 
the company expenses advance commissions ratably over the first month of the related membership 
the level of commission expense in relation to membership revenues varies depending on the level of new memberships written and is expected to be higher when the company experiences increases in new membership sales 
during the last five years this percentage has ranged from approximately to of membership revenues 
associate services and direct marketing expenses are directly impacted by the number of new associates enrolled during a period due to the cost of materials provided to such new associates  the number of associates subscribing to the company s eservice offering  the amount of sales tools purchased by the sales force as well as the number of those associates who successfully meet the fast start to success training and incentive award program qualifications 
generally  these costs are more than offset by associate services revenue  although this did not occur in due to the lower entry fees charged during most of the year 
general and administrative expenses are expected to trend up in terms of dollars  but remain relatively constant as a percent of revenues 
during the past five years  general and administrative expenses have ranged from to of total revenues 
the primary benchmarks monitored by the company throughout the various periods include the number of active memberships and their related retention characteristics  the number of new memberships written  the number of new associates enrolled and the percentage of new associates that successfully meet the fast start to success qualification requirements 
the company experienced decreases in both the number of new memberships written and the number of new associates enrolled during compared to the prior year  the first year such a decrease has occurred in more than ten years 
during the fourth quarter  the company eliminated the commission advances to certain associates that had below average retention and due to below average retention rates of internet submitted memberships  the company placed restrictions on those associates who are able to submit new memberships via the internet 
these actions naturally reduced the number of new memberships written and new associates enrolled during the fourth quarter and during but demonstrate the company s commitment to improve membership retention 
the company also attributes such decline  in part  to negative publicity see risk factors 
such adverse publicity may affect the company s ability to write new memberships especially in large employee groups  recruit new associates and may have a detrimental effect on the persistency of the company s memberships 
however depending on the average monthly membership fee and the entry price for new associates  the company may experience declines in both areas in terms of numbers but may experience increases in both membership fees and associate services revenue and vice versa although the company has grown its active membership base and related membership fees in each of the past years  the rate of growth has slowed to an unacceptable rate 
the company believes however  that its current product design  pricing parameters and business model are generally appropriate and it has no immediate plans to change these fundamental sectors 
the company s focus during will be on improved training of its associates  enhancing the quality and quantity of sales tools provided to new and existing associates  providing incentives for associates to write consistent  quality business and continued emphasis on improving the basic retention characteristics of its memberships 
during the first part of  the company has updated its fast start to success training program materials and hosted more than fast start trainers at its new corporate headquarters in order to train the trainers on the updated training materials 
also  beginning in  the company has increased the amount of sales tools that are included in the new associate kit and provided a supplemental package of sale tools if the new associate qualifies pursuant to the fast start rules 
the company has also increased the number of points needed to qualify for its player s club incentive award program to encourage more productivity from both its new and existing associates 
critical accounting policies the company s financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
these estimates and assumptions are affected by management s application of accounting policies 
if these estimates or assumptions are incorrect  there could be a material change in the company s financial condition or operating results 
many of these critical accounting policies are common in the insurance and financial services industries  others are specific to the company s business and operations 
the company s critical accounting policies include estimates relating to revenue recognition related to membership and associate fees  deferral of membership and associate related costs  expense recognition related to commissions to associates  accrual of incentive awards payable and accounting for legal contingencies 
revenue recognition membership and associate fees the company s principal revenues are derived from membership fees  most of which are collected on a monthly basis 
memberships are generally guaranteed renewable and non cancelable except for fraud  non payment of membership fees or upon written request 
membership fees are recognized in income ratably over the related service period in accordance with membership terms  which generally require the holder of the membership to remit fees on an annual  semi annual or monthly basis 
approximately of members remit their membership fees on a monthly basis  of which approximately are paid in advance and  therefore  are deferred and recognized over the following month 
at december  the deferred revenue associated with the membership fees was million which is classified as a current liability 
the company also charges new members  who are not part of an employee group  a enrollment fee 
this enrollment fee and related incremental direct and origination costs are deferred and recognized in income over the estimated life of a membership in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  sab 
at december  the deferred revenue associated with the membership enrollment fees was million  of which million was classified as a current liability 
the company computes the expected membership life using over years of actuarial data as explained in more detail in the measures of membership retention section of md a 
at december   management computed the expected membership life to be approximately years  which is unchanged from year end if the expected membership life were to change significantly  which management does not expect in the short term  the deferred membership enrollment fee and related costs would be recognized over a longer or shorter period 
the company derives revenues from services provided to its marketing sales force from a one time non refundable enrollment fee of from each new sales associate for which the company provides initial sales and marketing supplies and enrollment services to the associate 
revenue from  and costs of  the initial sales and marketing supplies approximately are recognized when the materials are delivered to the associates 
the remaining of revenues and related incremental direct and origination costs are deferred and recognized over the estimated average active service period of associates which at december  is estimated to be approximately six months  unchanged from year end at december   the deferred revenue associated with sales associate enrollment fees was million  which is classified as a current liability 
management estimates the active service period of an associate periodically based on the average number of months an associate produces new memberships including those associates that fail to write any memberships 
if the active service period of associates changes significantly  which management does not expect in the short term  the deferred revenue and related costs would be recognized over the new estimated active service period 
member and associate costs deferred costs represent the incremental direct and origination costs the company incurs in enrolling new members and new associates related to the deferred revenue discussed above  and that portion of payments made to provider law firms million deferred at december  which is classified as a current asset and associates related to deferred membership revenue 
deferred costs for enrolling new members include the cost of the membership kit and salary and benefit costs for employees who process membership enrollments  and were million at december   of which million is classified in current assets 
deferred costs for enrolling new associates include training and success bonuses paid to individuals involved in recruiting the associate and salary and benefit costs of employees who process associate enrollments  and were million at december   and is classified as a current asset 
such costs are deferred to the extent of the lesser of actual costs incurred or the amount of the related fee charged for such services 
deferred costs are amortized to expense over the same period as the related deferred revenue as discussed above 
deferred costs that will be recognized within one year of the balance sheet date are classified as current and all remaining deferred costs are considered noncurrent 
associate related costs are reflected as associate services and direct marketing  and are expensed as incurred if not related to the deferred revenue discussed above 
these costs include providing materials and services to associates  fast start bonuses  associate introduction kits  associate incentive programs  group marketing and marketing services departments including costs of related travel  marketing events  leadership summits and international sales convention 
commissions to associates beginning with new memberships written after march   the company implemented a level commission schedule approximately per annum at december  with up to a three year advance commission payment 
prior to march   the company s commission program provided for advance commission payments to associates of approximately of first year membership premiums on new membership sales and commissions were earned by the associate at a rate of approximately in all subsequent years 
effective march   and in order to offer additional incentives for increased membership retention rates  the company returned to a differential commission structure with rates of approximately of first year membership premiums on new memberships written and variable renewal commission rates ranging from five to per annum based on the first month membership retention rate of the associate s personal sales and those of his organization 
beginning in august  the company allowed the associate to choose between the level commission structure and up to three year commission advance or the differential commission structure with a one year commission advance 
prior to january the company advanced commissions at the time of sale of all new memberships 
in january  the company implemented a policy whereby the associate receives only earned commissions on the first three sales unless the associate has successfully completed the fast start training program 
for all sales beginning with the fourth membership or all sales made by an associate successfully completing the fast start training program  the company currently advances commission payments at the time of sale of a new membership 
the amount of cash potentially advanced upon the sale of a new membership  prior to the recoupment of any charge backs described below  represents an amount equal to up to one year commission earnings 
although the average number of marketing associates receiving an advance commission payment on a new membership is  the overall initial advance may be paid to approximately different individuals  each at a different level within the overall commission structure 
the commission advance immediately increases an associate s unearned advance commission balance to the company 
although the company  prior to march   advanced its sales associates up to three years commission when a membership is sold and subsequent to march   up to one year commission  the average commission advance paid to its sales associates as a group is actually less than the maximum amount possible because some associates choose to receive less than a full advance and the company pays less than a full advance on some of its specialty products 
in addition  the company may from time to time place associates on a less than full advance basis if there are problems with the quality of the business being submitted or other performance problems with an associate 
additionally  the company does not advance commissions on certain categories of group business which have historically demonstrated below average retention characteristics 
also  any residual commissions due an associate defined as commission on an individual membership after the advance has been earned are retained to reduce any remaining unearned commission advance balances prior to being paid to that sales associate 
for those associates that have made at least personal sales  opened at least one group and personally write or more of their organizational business  of their commissions are set aside in individual reserve balance accounts  further reducing the amount of advance commissions 
the average commission advance paid as a percentage of the maximum advance possible pursuant to the company s commission structures was approximately  and during  and  respectively 
the commission cost per new membership sold has increased over each of the last three years by  and for  and  respectively  and varies depending on the compensation structure that is in place at the time a new membership is sold and the amount of any charge backs recoupment of previous commission advances that are deducted from amounts that would otherwise be paid to the various sales associates that are compensated for the membership sale 
should the company add additional products  such as the identity theft shield described above or add additional commissions to its compensation plan or reduce the amount of chargebacks collected from its associates  the commission cost per new membership will increase accordingly 
the company expenses advance commissions ratably over the first month of the related membership 
at december   advance commissions deferred were million and included as a current asset 
as a result of this accounting policy  the company s commission expenses are all recognized over the first month of a membership and there is no commission expense recognized for the same membership during the remainder of the advance period 
the company tracks its unearned advance commission balances outstanding in order to ensure the advance commissions are recovered before any renewal commissions are paid and for internal purposes of analyzing its commission advance program 
while not recorded as an asset  unearned advance commission balances from associates for the following years ended december were amounts in s beginning unearned advance commission balances    advance commissions  net of chargebacks and other    earned commissions applied    advance commission write offs    ending unearned advance commission balances before estimated unrecoverable balances    estimated unrecoverable advance commission balances    ending unearned advance commission balances  net    these amounts do not represent fair value  as they do not take into consideration timing of estimated recoveries 
estimated unrecoverable advances increased as a percentage of ending advances from at december  to at december  primarily due to the change in the compensation structure described above from a month possible advance to a month possible advance 
this change allows the advances to be earned more quickly by the associate so the increase in advances before estimated unrecoverable balances increased from to compared to a decrease of from to the ending unearned advance commission balances  net  above includes net unearned advance commission balances of non vested associates of million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
as such  at december  future commissions and related expense will be reduced as unearned advance commission balances of million are recovered 
commissions are earned by the associate as membership premiums are earned by the company  usually on a monthly basis 
the company reduces unearned advance commission balances or remits payment to an associate  as appropriate  when commissions are earned 
should a membership lapse before the advances have been recovered for each commission level  the company  except as described below  generates an immediate charge back to the applicable sales associate to recapture up to of any unearned advance on memberships written prior to march   and on any memberships written thereafter 
beginning in august  the company allowed the associate to choose between the level commission structure and up to three year commission advance and up to chargebacks or the differential commission structure with a one year commission advance and up to chargebacks 
this charge back is deducted from any future advances that would otherwise be payable to the associate for additional new memberships 
in order to encourage additional membership sales  the company waived chargebacks for associates that met certain criteria in december and march  which effectively increases the company s commission expense 
any remaining unearned advance commission balance may be recovered by withholding future residual earned commissions due to an active associate on active memberships 
additionally  even though a commission advance may have been fully recovered on a particular membership  no additional commission earnings from any membership are paid to an associate until all previous advances on all memberships  both active and lapsed  have been recovered 
the company also has reduced chargebacks from to for certain senior marketing associates who have demonstrated the ability to maintain certain levels of sales over specified periods and maintain certain membership retention levels 
the company may adjust chargebacks from time to time in the future in order to encourage certain production incentives 
prior to march   the company charged associates a fee on unearned advance commission balances relating to lapsed memberships membership lapse fee 
the fee that was recorded on the associates unearned commission balance was determined by applying the prime interest rate to the unearned advance commission balance pertaining to lapsed memberships 
the company realized and recognized this fee only when the amount of the calculated fee was collected by withholding from cash commission payments due the associate 
the fees collected reduced commission expense 
the company s ability to recover these fees was primarily dependant on the associate selling new memberships  which qualify for commission advances 
the company eliminated the membership lapse fee for memberships sold after march  in conjunction with the change in the commission structure described above 
the company has the contractual right to require associates to repay unearned advance commission balances from sources other than earned commissions including cash a from all associates either i upon termination of the associate relationship  which includes but is not limited to when an associate becomes non vested or ii when it is ascertained that earned commissions are insufficient to repay the unearned advance commission payments and b upon demand  from agencies or associates who are parties to the associate agreements signed between october and july or july to august  respectively 
the sources  other than earned commissions  that may be available to recover associate unearned advance commission balances are potentially subject to limitation based on applicable state laws relating to creditors rights generally 
historically  the company has not demanded repayments of the unearned advance commission balances from associates  including terminated associates  because collection efforts would likely increase costs and have the potential to disrupt the company s relationships with its sales associates 
this business decision by the company has a significant effect on the company s cash flow by electing to defer collection of advance payments of which approximately million were not expected to be collected from future commissions at december  however  the company regularly reviews the unearned advance commission balance status of associates and will exercise its right to require associates to repay advances when management believes that such action is appropriate 
non vested associates are those that are no longer vested because they fail to meet the company s established vesting requirements by selling at least three new memberships per quarter or retaining a personal membership 
non vested associates lose their right to any further commissions earned on memberships previously sold at the time they become non vested 
as a result the company has no continuing obligation to individually account to these associates as it does to active associates and is entitled to retain all commission earnings that would be otherwise payable to these terminated associates 
the company does continue to reduce the unearned advance commission balances for commissions earned on active memberships previously sold by those associates 
substantially all individual non vested associate unearned advance commission balances were less than  and the average balance was at december  although the advance commissions are expensed ratably over the first month of the related membership  the company assesses  at the end of each quarter  on an associate by associate basis  the recoverability of each associate s unearned advanced commission balance by estimating the associate s future commissions to be earned on active memberships 
each active membership is assumed to lapse in accordance with the company s estimated future lapse rate  which is based on the company s actual historical membership retention experience as applied to each active membership s year of origin 
the lapse rate is based on the company s more than year history of membership retention rates  which is updated quarterly to reflect actual experience 
the company also closely reviews current data for any trends that would affect the historical lapse rate 
the sum of all expected future commissions to be earned for each associate is then compared to that associate s unearned advance commission balance 
the company estimates unrecoverable advance commission balances when expected future commissions to be earned on active memberships aggregated on an associate by associate basis are less than the unearned advance commission balance 
if an associate with an outstanding unearned advance commission balance has no active memberships  the unearned advance commission balance is written off but has no financial statement impact as advance commissions are expensed ratably over the first month of the related memberships 
refer to measures of member retention expected membership life  expected remaining membership life for a description of the method used by the company to estimate future commission earnings 
further  the company s analysis of the recoverability of unearned advance commission balances is also based on the assumption that the associate does not write any new memberships 
the company believes that this assessment methodology is highly conservative since its actual experience is that many associates do continue to sell new memberships and the company  through its chargeback rights  gains an additional source to recover unearned advance commission balances 
changes in the company s estimates with respect to recoverability of unearned commissions could occur if the underlying membership persistency changes from historical levels 
should membership persistency decrease  the unearned commissions would be recovered over a longer period and the amount not recovered would most likely increase  although any increase in uncollectible unearned commissions would not have any immediate expense impact since the commission advances are expensed in the month they incurred 
holding all other factors constant  the decline in persistency would also lead to lower membership fees  less net income and less cash flow from operations 
conversely  should persistency increase  the unearned commissions would be recovered more quickly  the amount unrecovered would decrease and  holding all other factors constant  the company would enjoy higher membership fees  more net income and more cash flow from operations 
incentive awards payable associates can earn the right to attend an annual incentive trip by meeting monthly qualification requirements for the entire calendar year and maintaining certain personal retention rates for the memberships sold during the calendar year 
associates can also earn the right to receive additional monthly bonuses by meeting the monthly qualification requirements for twelve consecutive months and maintaining certain personal retention rates for the memberships sold during that twelve month period 
the incentive awards payable at any date is estimated based on an evaluation of the existing associates that have met the monthly qualifications  any changes to the monthly qualification requirements  the estimated cost for each incentive earned and the number of associates that have historically met the personal retention rates 
at december   the accrued amount payable was million 
changes to any of these assumptions would directly affect the amount accrued but the company does not expect any of the significant trends impacting this account to change significantly in the near term 
legal contingencies the company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims  the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty 
given the inherent unpredictability of litigation  it is difficult to estimate the impact of litigation on the company s financial condition or results of operation 
sfas  accounting for contingencies  requires that an estimated loss from a loss contingency should be accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred 
the company evaluates  among other factors  the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss 
the company has established an accrued liability it believes will be sufficient to cover estimated damages in connection with various cases  which at december  was million 
this process requires subjective judgment about the likely outcomes of litigation 
liabilities related to most of the company s lawsuits are especially difficult to estimate due to the nature of the claims  limitation of available data and uncertainty concerning the numerous variables used to determine likely outcomes or the amounts recorded 
litigation expenses are recorded as incurred and the company does not accrue for future legal fees 
it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain cases or increased litigation costs could have an adverse effect upon the company s financial condition  operating results or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods 
see legal proceedings 
other general matters operating ratios three principal operating measures monitored by the company in addition to measures of membership retention are the membership benefits ratio  commission ratio and the general and administrative expense ratio 
the membership benefits ratio  the commissions ratio and the general and administrative expense ratio represent those costs as a percentage of membership fees 
the company strives to maintain these ratios as low as possible while at the same time providing adequate incentive compensation to its sales associates and provider law firms 
these ratios do not measure total profitability because they do not take into account all revenues and expenses 
cash flow considerations relating to sales of memberships the company generally advances significant commissions at the time a membership is sold 
since approximately of membership fees are collected on a monthly basis  a significant cash flow deficit is created at the time a membership is sold 
this deficit is reduced as monthly membership fees are remitted and no additional commissions are paid on the membership until all previous unearned advance commission balances have been fully recovered 
since the cash advanced at the time of sale of a new membership may be recovered over a multi year period  cash flow from operations may be adversely affected depending on the number of new memberships written in relation to the existing active base of memberships and the composition of new or existing sales associates producing such memberships 
investment policy the company s investment policy is to some degree controlled by certain insurance regulations  which  coupled with management s own investment philosophy  results in a conservative investment portfolio that is not risk oriented 
the company s investments consist of common stocks  investment grade rated baa or higher preferred stocks and investment grade bonds primarily issued by corporations  the united states treasury  federal agencies  federally sponsored agencies and enterprises  as well as mortgage backed securities and state and municipal tax exempt bonds 
the company is required to pledge investments to various state insurance departments as a condition to obtaining authority to do business in certain states

is to rescind accounting guidance contained in sab no 
and the sec s revenue recognition in financial statements frequently asked questions and answers the faq related to multiple element revenue arrangements in order to make this interpretive guidance consistent with current authoritative accounting and auditing guidance and sec rules and regulations 
the company does not expect the issuance of sab no 
to significantly impact its current revenue recognition policies 
measures of member retention one of the major factors affecting the company s profitability and cash flow is the ability of the company to retain a membership  and therefore continue to receive fees  once it has been sold 
the company monitors its overall membership persistency rate  as well as the retention rates with respect to memberships sold by individual associates and agents and retention rates with respect to memberships by year of issue  geographic region  utilization characteristics and payment method  and other sub groupings 
terminology the following terms are used in describing the various measures of retention o membership life is a period that commences on the day of initial enrollment of a member and continues until the individual s membership eventually terminates or lapses the terms terminate or lapse may be used interchangeably here 
o membership age means the time since the membership has been in effect 
o lapse rate means the percentage of memberships of a specified group of memberships that lapse in a specified time period 
o retention rate is the complement of a lapse rate  and means the percentage of memberships of a specified group that remain in force at the end of a specified time period 
o persistency and retention are used in a general context to mean the tendency for memberships to continue to remain in force  while the term persistency rate is a specific measure that is defined below 
o lapse rates  retention rates  persistency rates  and expected membership life may be referred to as measures of membership retention 
o expected membership life means the average number of years a new membership is expected to remain in force 
o blended rate when used in reference to any measure of member retention means a rate computed across a mix of memberships of various membership ages 
o expected remaining membership life means the number of additional years that an existing member is expected to continue to renew from a specific point in time based on the membership life 
variations in membership retention by sub groups  impact on aggregate numbers company wide measures of membership retention include data relating to members who can potentially be further sorted by identifiable sub groupings 
for example  memberships may be subdivided into those owned by members who are or are not sales associates  to those who are or are not members of group plans  etc 
measures of membership retention of different sub groups may vary 
for example  the company s experience indicates that first year retention rate of memberships owned by members who also are sales associates is approximately better than retention of memberships owned by non associate members 
while this correlation can be identified  the cause and effect relationship here cannot be isolated 
these sales associate members may have a financial incentive to retain the membership in order to continue to receive commissions 
they also likely have a better understanding and appreciation of the benefits of the membership  which may have contributed in fact to their decision to also become a sales associate 
additionally  members who have accessed the services of the provider law firms historically have higher retention rates than those who have not 
all aggregate measures of membership retention or expected life may be impacted by shifts in the underlying enrollment mix of sub groups that have different retention rates 
for example memberships owned by non associate new members have comprised an increasing percentage of new memberships enrolled each year over the past five years 
since non associate members have a known lower first year retention rate  a shift in mix alone will cause a reduction in reported aggregate retention measures and expected member life  even if the retention rates within each sub group do not change 
it is important to note that all blended rates discussed here may reflect the impact of such shifts in enrollment mixes 
at december    of the active  memberships were also vested associates which represents of the total active memberships 
the following table shows total new memberships sold during each year and the number and percentage of memberships sold to persons who are associates 
total new associate year memberships memberships ratio variations in retention over life of a membership  impact on aggregate measures measures of member retention also vary significantly by the membership age 
historically  the company has observed that memberships in their first year have a significantly higher lapse rate than memberships in their second year  and so on 
the following chart shows the historical observed lapse rates and corresponding yearly retention rates as a function of membership age 
for example  of all new memberships lapse during the first year  leaving still in force at the end of the first year 
more tenured memberships have significantly lower lapse rates 
for example  by year seven lapse rates are under and annual retention exceeds 
the following table shows as of december  the company s blended retention rate and lapse rates based on its historical experience for the last years 
the blended retention and lapse rates as of the end of did not differ materially from those previously reported at the end of membership retention versus membership age membership yearly yearly end of year year lapse rate retention memberships membership persistency the company s membership persistency rate is a specific computation that measures the number of memberships in force at the end of a year as a percentage of the total of i memberships in force at the beginning of such year  plus ii new memberships sold during such year 
from through the year ended december   the company s annual membership persistency rates  using the foregoing method  have averaged approximately 
beginning new ending year memberships memberships total memberships persistency the company s overall membership persistency rate varies based on  among other factors  the relative age of total memberships in force  and shifts in the mix of members enrolled 
the company s overall membership persistency rate could become lower when the memberships in force include a higher proportion of newer memberships  as will happen following periods of rapid growth 
the company s overall membership persistency rate could also become lower when the new enrollments include a higher proportion of non associate members  a trend that has been observed over the past five years 
unless offset by other factors  these factors could result in a decline in the company s overall membership persistency rate as determined by the formula described above  but does not necessarily indicate that the new memberships written are less persistent 
expected membership life  expected remaining membership life using historical data through for all past members enrolled  the expected membership life can be computed to be approximately three years 
this number represents the average number of years a new membership can be expected to remain in force 
although about half of all new memberships may lapse in the first year  the expected membership life is much longer due to the contribution of higher annual retention rates in subsequent years 
since the company s experience is that the retention rate of a given generation of new memberships improves with membership age  the expected remaining membership life of a membership also increases with membership age 
for example  while a new membership may have an expected membership life of three years  the expected remaining membership life of a membership that reaches its first year anniversary is approximately four years 
since the actual population of memberships in force at any time is a distribution of ages from zero to more than years  the expected remaining membership life of the entire population at large greatly exceeds three years per membership 
as of december   based on the historical data described above  the current expected remaining membership life of the actual population is over six years per membership 
this measure is used by the company to estimate the future revenues expected from memberships currently in place 
expected membership life measures are based on more than years of historical membership retention data  unlike the membership persistency rate described above which is computed from  and determined by  the most recent one year period only 
both or these measures however include data from memberships of all membership ages and hence are referred to as blended measures 
actions that may impact retention in the future the potential impact on the company s future profitability and cash flow due to future changes in membership retention can be significant

the company has generated significant cash flow from operations of approximately million in and and million in as discussed below  the company has used a significant portion of its cash flow to repurchase shares of its stock in the open market 
cash flow from operations could be reduced if the company experienced significant growth in new members because of the negative cash flow characteristics of its commission advance policies discussed above 
as a result of the company s ability to generate cash flow from operations  including in periods of membership growth  it has not historically been dependent on  and does not expect to need in the future  external sources of financing from the sale of securities or from bank borrowings to fund its basic business operations 
however  as described below  in and  the company incurred debt for limited and specific purposes to permit it to construct a new corporate headquarters and to accelerate its treasury stock purchase program

at december   the company had approximately million available to purchase additional treasury shares 
no time limit has been set for completion of the treasury stock purchase program

risk factors there are a number of risk factors which could affect our financial condition or results of operations 
our future results may be adversely affected if membership persistency or renewal rates are lower than our historical experience 
the company has over years of actual historical experience to measure the expected retention of new members 
these retention rates could be adversely affected by the quality of services delivered by provider law firms  the existence of competitive products or services  the company s ability to provide administrative services to members or other factors 
if the company s membership persistency or renewal rates are less than the company has historically experienced  the company s cash flow  earnings and growth rates could be adversely affected 
the company may not be able to grow memberships and earnings at the same rate as it has historically experienced and has recently experienced declines in new membership sales and associate recruitment 
the company s year end active memberships have increased  and in the years ended december   and  respectively 
net income for the same three years has increased  and  respectively 
however  beginning in the fourth quarter of and continuing in each quarter of  the company experienced declines in new memberships sold and during four of these five quarters also had a decline in the number of associates recruited compared to the comparable quarter of the prior year 
the company s ability to grow memberships and earnings is substantially dependent upon its ability to expand or enhance the productivity of its sales force  develop additional legal expense products  develop alternative marketing methods or expand geographically 
there is no assurance that the company will be able to achieve increases in membership and earnings growth comparable to its historical growth rates 
the company is dependent upon the continued active participation of its principal executive officer 
the success of the company depends substantially on the continued active participation of its principal executive officer  harland c 
stonecipher 
although the company s management includes other individuals with significant experience in the business of the company  the loss of the services of mr 
stonecipher could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
there is litigation pending that may have a material adverse effect on the company if adversely determined 
see item legal proceedings 
the company is in a regulated industry and regulations could have an adverse effect on the company s ability to conduct its business 
the company is regulated by or required to file with or obtain approval of state insurance departments  state bar associations and state attorney general s offices  depending on individual state positions regarding regulatory responsibility for prepaid legal expense plans 
regulation of the company s activities is inconsistent among the various states in which the company does business with some states regulating legal expense plans as insurance or specialized legal expense products and others regulating such plans as services 
such disparate regulation requires the company to structure its memberships and operations differently in certain states in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations 
the company s multi level marketing strategy is also subject to us federal  canadian provincial and us state regulation under laws relating to consumer protection  pyramid sales  business opportunity  lotteries and multi level marketing 
changes in the regulatory environment for the company s business could increase the compliance costs the company incurs in order to conduct its business or limit the jurisdictions in which the company is able to conduct business 
the business in which the company operates is competitive 
there are a number of existing and potential competitors that have the ability to offer competing products that could adversely affect the company s ability to grow 
in addition  the company may face competition from a growing number of internet based legal sites with the potential to offer legal and related services at competitive prices 
increased competition could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
see description of business competition 
the company is dependent upon the success of its marketing force 
the company s principal method of product distribution is through multi level marketing 
the success of a multi level marketing force is highly dependent upon the company s ability to offer a commission and organizational structure and sales training and incentive program that enable sales associates to recruit and develop other sales associates to create an organization 
there are a number of other products and services that use multi level marketing as a distribution method and the company must compete with these organizations to recruit  maintain and grow its multi level marketing force 
in order to do so  the company may be required to increase its marketing costs through increases in commissions  sales incentives or other features  all of which could adversely affect the company s future earnings 
in addition  the level of confidence of the sales associates in the company s ability to perform is an important factor in maintaining and growing a multi level marketing force 
adverse financial developments concerning the company  including negative publicity or common stock price declines  could adversely affect the ability of the company to maintain the confidence of its sales force 
the company s stock price may be affected by the significant level of short sellers of the company s stock 
as of february   the new york stock exchange reported that approximately million shares of the company s stock were sold short  which constitutes approximately of the company s outstanding shares and of its public float  representing one of the largest short interest percentages of any new york stock exchange listed company 
short sellers expect to make a profit if the company s shares decline in value 
the company has been the subject of a negative publicity campaign from several known sources of information who support short sellers 
the existence of this short interest position may contribute to volatility in the company s stock price and may adversely affect the ability of the company s stock price to rise if market conditions or the company s performance would otherwise justify a price increase 
the company has not been able to increase significantly its employee group membership sales 
the company s success in growing membership sales is dependent in part on its ability to market to employee groups 
in  group memberships declined to of total memberships at year end compared to at december  adverse publicity about the company may affect the company s ability to market successfully to employee groups  particularly larger groups 
there is no assurance that the company will be able to increase its group business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk disclosures about market risk the company s consolidated balance sheets include a certain amount of assets and liabilities whose fair values are subject to market risk 
due to the company s significant investment in fixed maturity investments  interest rate risk represents the largest market risk factor affecting the company s consolidated financial position 
increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in fair values of those instruments 
additionally  fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments may be affected by the creditworthiness of the issuer  prepayment options  relative values of alternative investments  liquidity of the instrument and other general market conditions 
as of december   substantially all of the company s investments were in investment grade rated baa or higher fixed maturity investments and interest bearing money market accounts including certificates of deposit 
the company does not hold any investments classified as trading account assets or derivative financial instruments 
the table below summarizes the estimated effects of hypothetical increases and decreases in interest rates on the company s fixed maturity investment portfolio 
it is assumed that the changes occur immediately and uniformly  with no effect given to any steps that management might take to counteract that change 
the hypothetical changes in market interest rates reflect what could be deemed best and worst case scenarios 
the fair values shown in the following table are based on contractual maturities 
significant variations in market interest rates could produce changes in the timing of repayments due to prepayment options available 
the fair value of such instruments could be affected and  therefore  actual results might differ from those reflected in the following table hypothetical change estimated fair value in interest rate after hypothetical fair value bp basis points change in interest rate dollars in thousands fixed maturity investments at december   bp increase  bp increase  bp decrease  bp decrease  fixed maturity investments at december   bp increase  bp increase  bp decrease  bp decrease  excluding short term investments with a fair value of million and million at december  and  respectively 
the table above illustrates  for example  that an instantaneous basis point increase in market interest rates at december  would reduce the estimated fair value of the company s fixed maturity investments by approximately million at that date 
at december   and based on the fair value of fixed maturity investments of million  an instantaneous basis point increase in market interest rates would have reduced the estimated fair value of the company s fixed maturity investments by approximately million at that date 
the company s million increase in fixed maturity investments from million at december  to million at december  was primarily from the million increase in daily variable interest rate municipal bonds 
the company s decreased sensitivity to rising interest rates is due to the million decrease in long term fixed maturity corporate obligation investments and a million increase in mid term us government investments 
the definitive extent of the interest rate risk is not quantifiable or predictable due to the variability of future interest rates  but the company does not believe such risk is material 
the company primarily manages its exposure to interest rate risk by purchasing investments that can be readily liquidated should the interest rate environment begin to significantly change 
interest rate risk the company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
as of december   the company had million in notes payable outstanding at interest rates indexed to the day libor rate that exposes it to the risk of increased interest costs if interest rates rise 
assuming a basis point increase in interest rates on the floating rate debt  interest expense would increase by approximately  additionally  the company had million invested in floating rate municipal bonds at year end 
assuming a basis point decrease in interest rates on the bonds  interest income would be reduced by approximately  as of december   the company had not entered into any interest rate swap agreements with respect to the term loans or the floating rate municipal bonds 
foreign currency exchange rate risk although the company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in revenues  net income and assets and liabilities denominated in canadian dollars  the potential change in foreign currency exchange rates is not a substantial risk  as approximately of the company s revenues are derived outside of the united states
