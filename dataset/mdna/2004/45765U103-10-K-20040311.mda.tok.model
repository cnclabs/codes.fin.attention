item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in item overview we are a leading provider of brand name computing products  it services and outsourcing of business processes primarily to business customers in the united states  canada and the united kingdom 
our business is organized in the following four operating segments single source provider of it products and services north america insight north america  single source provider of it products and services united kingdom insight uk  business process outsourcing provider direct alliance  and internet service provider plusnet 
for a business overview  as well as discussions about the operating strategy  growth strategy  industry and competition related to each of our operating segments  see business operating segments  in item we evaluate the performance of our operating segments based on results of operations before non recurring items 
reconciliations to consolidated results of operations can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements in item during the year ended december   we were affected negatively by a sluggish economy and cautious it spending in the united states  canada and the united kingdom 
additionally  a major focus in of our insight operations serving united states customers was on the successful completion of the it system conversion 
as of january  all of our insight north america employees serving united states customers now operate on the new system  which we refer to as maximus 
we are also cautiously optimistic about it spending trends  as it spending began to show some signs of improvement toward the end of our prior acquisitions are now fully integrated  our system conversion in the united states is complete and will be our year to turn our time and energy away from internal projects to focus on areas that enhance the customers experience doing business with us 
we will continue to make enhancements to our maximus system  including our websites  and our marketing and training initiatives will emphasize the value of our single source business model 
our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to assist in the understanding of our consolidated financial statements  the changes in certain key items in those consolidated financial statements from year to year  the primary factors that contributed to those changes  as well as how certain critical accounting policies and estimates affect our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates general our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  net sales and expenses 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
members of our senior management have discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
actual results  however  may differ from estimates we have made 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and either different estimates reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur periodically  that could materially affect the consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents sales recognition the majority of our sales are product sales  which are covered by our sales agreements containing our standard terms and conditions 
sales are recognized when the title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement for sale  delivery has occurred and or services have been rendered  the sales price is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
usual sales terms are free on board fob shipping point  meaning title and risk of loss are passed to the customer and delivery has occurred when the product is shipped 
persuasive evidence of the arrangement and fixed and determinable sales prices are documented via written sales contracts  purchase orders or both 
based on these criteria  the majority of our sales represent product sales recognized upon shipment 
from time to time  in connection with the sale of products and services  we enter into contracts that contain multiple elements or non standard terms and conditions 
as a result  significant contract interpretation may be required to determine the appropriate accounting  including how the price should be allocated among the deliverable elements if there are multiple deliverables  whether the delivered item s has stand alone value to the customer and when to recognize the sale 
we recognize sales for delivered items only when all of the following criteria are satisfied the delivered item s has value to the customer on a stand alone basis  there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered item s  and if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item  delivery or performance of the undelivered item s is considered probable and substantially in our control 
changes in the allocation of the sales price among deliverables might affect the timing of sales recognition but would not change the total sales recognized on the contract 
additionally  sales of services currently represent a very small percentage of our net sales  and the majority of our services are performed in our facilities prior to shipment of the product 
in these circumstances  net sales for both the product and services are recognized upon shipment 
in other cases  net sales of services are typically recorded as the services are performed 
net sales attributable to arrangements that include warehousing product for our customers are deferred until the product is shipped 
we also sell certain third party service contracts and certain software licenses for which we are not the primary obligor 
these sales do not meet the criteria for gross sales recognition because we do not assume the risks and rewards of ownership in the transaction and thus are recorded on a net sales recognition basis 
as we enter into contracts with third party service providers or vendors  we must evaluate whether the sales of such services should be recorded as gross sales or net sales 
under gross sales recognition  we are the primary obligor and the entire selling price is recorded in sales with our cost to the third party service provider or vendor recorded in costs of goods sold 
under net sales recognition  the cost to the third party service provider or vendor is recorded as a reduction to sales resulting in net sales equal to the gross profit on the transaction with no costs of goods sold 
we make provisions for estimated product returns that we expect to occur under our return policy based upon historical return rates 
should customers return a different amount of product than originally estimated  future net sales are adjusted to reflect historical return rates 
restructuring and acquisition integration activities we have engaged  and may continue to engage  in restructuring and acquisition integration activities which require us to utilize significant estimates related primarily to employee termination benefits  estimated costs to terminate leases or remaining lease commitments on unused facilities  net of estimated subleases 
depending on the characteristics of the restructuring or acquisition integration activities  the costs associated will be recorded as expenses or additions to goodwill 
should the actual amounts differ from our estimates  adjustments to goodwill or restructuring expense in subsequent periods would be necessary 
for insight uk  any amounts that normally would be recorded as adjustments to goodwill will be recorded in the statement of operations because insight uk recorded a goodwill impairment charge during which eliminated its entire goodwill balance 
a detailed description of our restructuring and acquisition integration activities and remaining accruals for these activities at december  can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements in item taxes on earnings our effective tax rate includes the effect of certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no united states taxes have been provided because such earnings are planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the united states 
earnings remittance amounts are planned based on the projected cash flow needs as well as the working capital and long term investment requirements of our foreign subsidiaries and our domestic operations 
material changes in our estimates of cash  working capital and long term investment requirements could affect our effective tax rate 

table of contents we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider past operating results  future market growth  forecasted earnings  historical and projected taxable income  the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate  prudent and feasible tax planning strategies and statutory tax law changes in determining the need for a valuation allowance 
if we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made 
likewise  if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized  the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed 
valuation of long lived assets including purchased intangible assets and goodwill we review property  plant and equipment  and purchased intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
our asset impairment review assesses the fair value of the assets based on the future cash flows the assets are expected to generate 
an impairment loss is recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset plus net proceeds expected from disposition of the asset if any are less than the carrying value of the asset 
this approach uses our estimates of future market growth  forecasted net sales and costs  expected periods the assets will be utilized and appropriate discount rates 
annually  during the fourth quarter of each year  we assess whether goodwill is impaired 
upon determining the existence of goodwill impairment  we measure that impairment based on the amount by which the book value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by deducting the fair value of a reporting unit s identifiable assets and liabilities from the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole 
determining the fair value of reporting units  as well as identifiable assets and liabilities  uses our estimates of market capitalization allocation  future market growth  forecasted sales and costs and appropriate discount rates 
additional impairment assessments may be performed on an interim basis if we encounter events or changes in circumstances that would indicate that  more likely than not  the book value of goodwill has been impaired 
such evaluations of impairment of long lived assets including goodwill and purchased intangible assets are an integral part of  but do not constitute all of our actions relating to  our strategic reviews of our business and operations performed in conjunction with restructuring actions 
when impairment is identified  the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its estimated fair value 
deterioration of our business in a geographic region or within a business segment in the future could lead to impairment adjustments as such issues are identified 
allowances for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses on customer and vendor receivables based on historical write offs  evaluation of the aging of the receivables and the current economic environment 
should our customers circumstances change or actual collections of customer and vendor receivables differ from our estimates  adjustments to the provision for losses on accounts receivable and the related allowances for doubtful accounts would be necessary 
write downs of inventories we evaluate inventories for excess  obsolescence or other factors that may render inventories unmarketable at normal margins 
write downs are recorded so that inventories reflect the approximate net realizable value and take into account our contractual provisions with our suppliers governing price protection  stock rotation and return privileges relating to obsolescence 
because of the large number of transactions and the complexity of managing the process around price protections and stock rotations  estimates are made regarding adjustments to the carrying amount of inventories 
additionally  assumptions about future demand  market conditions and decisions by manufacturers to discontinue certain products or product lines can affect our decision to write down inventories 
if our assumptions about future demand change or actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected  additional write downs of inventories may be required 
in any case  actual values could be different from those estimated 
business combinations we are required to allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed  based on their estimated fair values 
the determination of fair values requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to acquired intangible assets 
critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from customer contracts  customer lists  brand awareness and market position  as well as assumptions about the period of time the brand will continue to be used in our product portfolio  and discount rates 
our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable  but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and  as a result  actual results may differ from estimates 
other estimates 
table of contents associated with the accounting for acquisitions may change as additional information becomes available regarding the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
consideration received from vendors we receive payments and credits from vendors  including consideration pursuant to volume sales incentive programs and cooperative marketing programs 
pursuant to emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting by a reseller for cash consideration received from a vendor  which we adopted january   vendor consideration received pursuant to volume sales incentive programs is classified as a reduction to costs of goods sold and is recognized upon certain product sales volume thresholds being met 
cooperative marketing programs  which represent a reimbursement of specific  incremental  identifiable costs  are included as a reduction of the related selling and administrative expenses in the period the program takes place 
consideration that exceeds the specific  incremental  identifiable costs is classified as a reduction of costs of goods sold 
additionally  vendor consideration based on volume purchase incentives  rather than volume sales incentives  is also allocated to inventories based on applicable incentives from each vendor

net sales for the year ended december  increased to billion from billion for the year ended december  the addition of net sales from the april  acquisition of comark contributed the majority of the increase while it spending overall continued to decline in north america and the united kingdom  offsetting a portion of this increase 
our net sales by segment were as follows in thousands years ended december  change insight north america insight uk direct alliance plusnet consolidated insight north america increased net sales for the year ended december  by to billion from billion for the year ended december  this increase was attributable to net sales from comark  which was acquired on april  and therefore included in only eight months of operations in compared to twelve months of this increase was partially offset by a decline in overall it spending in an uncertain economic and international environment

insight uk s net sales decreased by  to million for the year ended december  from million in the decrease is due primarily to a weakened it spending environment over the past year  particularly in the larger corporate enterprises  partially offset by increases in the british pound sterling exchange rates

increases in the british pound sterling exchange rates accounted for million of the increase in net sales from to gross profit 
gross profit increased  to million in from million in as a percentage of sales  gross margin increased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  the increase in gross margin was due primarily to increases in product margins on sales to small to medium sized business customers serviced by insight north america  a change in accounting classification for certain funds received from vendors for insight north america and insight uk  increases in service sales  which generally have a higher gross margin than product sales  for insight north america  increases in product and freight margins for insight uk  decreases in the write downs of inventories for insight north america and insight uk  and higher fixed performance fees and guarantees from the direct alliance client whose program ended in the second quarter of and an existing client program yearly performance guarantee that did not occur in the increases were offset partially by lower gross margins on sales to large corporate customers added with the acquisition of comark  decreases in supplier reimbursements for insight north america and insight uk and decreases in service sales  which generally have a higher gross margin than product sales  for insight uk 
effective january   the company adopted eitf issue no 
 accounting by a reseller for cash consideration received from a vendor 
as a result of the adoption of this pronouncement  we recorded approximately million of vendor consideration as a reduction to costs of goods sold during the year ended december  that  prior to the adoption  would have been classified as a reduction of selling and administrative expenses 
for the year ended december   the change in classification resulted in a increase in gross margin and a corresponding increase in selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales compared to the prior classification 

table of contents operating expenses 
selling and administrative expenses 
selling and administrative expenses increased  to million in from million in  and increased as a percent of net sales to in from in the increase in selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales in the compared to was due primarily to additional costs  including stay bonuses  associated with maintaining duplicate support departments until the it system conversion and final integration of comark was completed in insight north america  a change in accounting classification of certain funds received from vendors for insight north america and insight uk  accelerated depreciation due to a change in the estimated useful life of certain software assets that will no longer be used after the it systems conversion in insight north america is completed  and increased training expenses associated with the it systems conversion in insight north america 
these increases in expenses were offset partially by expense reductions resulting from the continuing integration of comark s operations into the operations of insight north america  cost cutting initiatives and decreases in bad debt expense in insight north america and insight uk and increased capitalization of salaries and consultant fees in connection with the it systems conversion 
restructuring expenses 
during the year ended december   insight north america recorded million in restructuring expenses associated with costs incurred to close insight north america s distribution facility in indiana and severance associated with the elimination of certain support and management positions

the increase in interest income in is due to the increase in cash invested in the united kingdom at higher interest rates than the united states  offset partially by declining interest rates on short term investments in the united states 
non operating expenses  other than interest expense  of million and million in and  respectively  consist primarily of bank fees associated with financing arrangements and cash management

 goodwill and other intangible assets  under which goodwill is no longer amortized but instead is assessed for impairment at least annually 
goodwill was tested for impairment upon adoption of sfas no 
as of january  with no resulting impairment of goodwill 
we completed our annual assessment of the impairment of goodwill during the fourth quarter of as a result of the decline in insight uk s operating performance  insight uk s book value exceeded its market value resulting in an impairment of goodwill

the cash held in canada and the united kingdom could be repatriated to the united states  but  under current law  would be subject to united states federal income taxes  less applicable foreign tax credits 
our intent is that the cash balances will remain in these countries for future growth and investments  and we will meet any liquidity requirements in the united states through ongoing cash flows  external borrowings  or both 
our primary use of cash has been to fund our working capital requirements  acquisitions and capital expenditures necessitated by our growth 
net cash provided by operating activities 
operating cash flows for the year ended december  resulted primarily from net earnings before depreciation  a decrease in accounts receivable  a decrease in other current assets and an increase in accrued expenses 
the decrease in accounts receivable is due to a reduction in the growth rate of net sales due to a sluggish economy and enhanced collection efforts  while the decrease in other current assets is due primarily to the return of a refundable deposit paid in connection with prior financing arrangements that we terminated at the end of these 
table of contents increases to cash flow from operations were offset by decreases in accounts payable and increases in inventories as discussed below 
our consolidated cash flow operating metrics are as follows years ended december  days outstanding in ending accounts receivable dsos inventory turns excluding inventories not available for sale dsos decreased in and due to enhanced collection efforts 
the decrease in was offset partially by our expanded collection of sales tax in the united states effective september  because sales tax is included in accounts receivable but not net sales 
the decrease in annualized inventory turns in resulted from increases in opportunistic purchases  increases in our inventory of certain categories due to anticipated product shortages  changes in a manufacturer s buying programs  and an increase in inventories to service larger corporate customers acquired with the comark acquisition 
the decrease in from was due primarily to an increase in inventories to service larger corporate customers acquired with the comark acquisition 
cash flows from operations for the past three years have exceeded net earnings loss 
however  if sales increase in the future  we expect that cash flow from operations will be used  at least partially  to fund working capital as we typically increase balances in our inventories and pay our suppliers  in order to take advantage of supplier discounts  on average terms that are shorter than the average terms granted to our customers 
net cash used in investing activities 
capital expenditures for the year ended december  primarily relate to software  hardware and capitalized software development costs associated with the it system conversion in insight north america 
capital expenditures for year ended december  primarily relate to capitalized costs of computer software developed for internal use  purchases of computer equipment and capital improvements to our facility in the united kingdom  which we purchased in in and  investment activities included acquisitions in the united states  canada and the united kingdom 
we expect capital expenditures in  primarily relating to purchased software and internal development of software enhancements related to our it systems and purchases of computer equipment  to be between million and million

net borrowings on financing arrangements in were due primarily to the acquisition of comark 
the total outstanding balance under our line of credit and accounts receivable securitization facility was reduced to million at december  from million at december  due to cash flow from operations and cash received from the exercise of stock options 
additionally in  we prepaid million of building mortgages  with interest rates ranging from to  with borrowings from our existing financing arrangements 
we anticipate that cash flow from operations and stock option exercises  together with the funds available under our financing facilities  will be adequate to support our presently anticipated cash and working capital requirements for operations through and longer if we successfully renew our short term finance arrangement when its current term ends on december  we may need additional debt or equity financing to continue funding our internal growth beyond in addition  as part of our long term growth strategy  we intend to consider appropriate acquisition opportunities from time to time  which may require additional debt or equity financing 
financing facilities our financing facilities include a million accounts receivable securitization financing arrangement  a million revolving line of credit and a million inventories financing facility 
we have an agreement to sell receivables periodically to a special purpose accounts receivable and financing entity the spe  which is exclusively engaged in purchasing receivables from us

the original financing arrangement expired december   and although terms of up to three years were available to us  we elected to renew the financing arrangement for one year based on pricing 
accordingly  the renewed financing arrangement expires december   and the million outstanding at december  is recorded as short term debt 
interest is payable monthly  and the interest rate on borrowed funds as of december  was 
we also pay a commitment fee on the financing arrangement equal to of the unused balance 
at december   million was available under the financing arrangement

this facility is non interest bearing if paid within its terms and expires december  our financing facilities contain various covenants including the requirement that we maintain a specified amount of tangible net worth and comply with leverage and minimum fixed charge requirements 
we were in compliance with all such covenants at december  contractual obligations at december   our contractual obligations were as follows in thousands payments due by period less than more than total year years years years long term debt including line of credit and capital leases  including current portion operating lease obligations restructuring obligations a purchase obligations b other contractual obligations c total a as a result of approved restructuring plans  we expect future cash expenditures related to employee termination benefits and facilities based costs 
although the facilities based costs represent contractual payments under long term leases  we are actively pursuing opportunities to negotiate out of these leases and have recorded the obligations as current accrued liabilities 
see further discussion in notes and to the consolidated financial statements in item b although we set purchase targets with our suppliers tied to the amount of supplier reimbursements we receive  we have no material contractual purchase obligations 
c in addition to the contractual obligations noted in the above table  we also have employment agreements with certain officers and employees under which severance payments would become payable in the event of specified terminations without cause or pursuant to a change in control 
in the event severance payments under the current employment agreements were to become payable  the maximum contingent severance payment calculated as of december  would be approximately million 
common stock repurchases although we did not repurchase shares of our common stock during the years ended  and  we have repurchased shares of our common stock in the past and may consider doing so again in the future 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet financing arrangements 
acquisitions our strategy includes the possible acquisition of other businesses to expand or complement our operations 
the magnitude  timing and nature of any future acquisitions will depend on a number of factors  including the availability of suitable acquisition candidates  the negotiation of acceptable terms  our financial capabilities and general economic and 
table of contents business conditions 
financing of future acquisitions would result in the utilization of cash  incurrence of additional debt  or both 
inflation we have not been adversely affected by inflation  as technological advances and competition within the it industry have generally caused the prices of the products we sell to decline 
this requires our growth in unit sales to exceed the decline in prices in order to have an increase in consolidated net sales 
we believe that most price increases could be passed on to our customers  as prices charged by us are not set by long term contracts  however  as a result of competitive pressure  there can be no assurance that the full effect of any such price increases could be passed on to our customers 
recently issued accounting standards in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no

factors that may affect future results and financial condition changes in the economic environment and or it industry may reduce demand for the products and services we sell 
our results of operations are influenced by a variety of factors  including general economic conditions  the condition of the it industry  shifts in demand for or availability of computer and related products and industry introductions of new products  upgrades or methods of distribution 
additionally  the potential for future terrorist attacks  the national and international responses to terrorist attacks or perceived threats to national security and other acts of war or hostility have created many economic and political uncertainties that could adversely affect our business and results of operations in ways that cannot presently be predicted 
the computer industry in general has felt the effects of the slowdown in the united states and european economies  and we specifically have seen a decrease in demand for the products and services we sell 
net sales can be dependent on demand for specific product categories  and any change in demand for or supply of such products could have a material adverse effect on our net sales if we fail to react in a timely manner to such changes 
our operating results are also highly dependent upon our level of gross profit as a percentage of net sales which fluctuates due to numerous factors  including changes in prices from suppliers  reductions in the amount of supplier reimbursements that are made available  changes in customer mix  the relative mix of products sold during the period  general competitive conditions  the availability of opportunistic purchases and opportunities to increase market share 
in addition  our expense levels  including the costs and salaries incurred in connection with the hiring of account executives  are based  in part  on anticipated net sales 
therefore  we may not be able to reduce spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected net sales shortfall 
as a result  comparisons of our quarterly financial results should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
actions of competitors  including manufacturers of products we sell  can negatively affect our business 
the it products and services industry is intensely competitive 
competition is based primarily on price  product availability  speed of delivery  credit availability  ability to tailor specific solutions to customer needs and quality and breadth of product lines 
we compete with manufacturers  including manufacturers of products we sell  as well as a large number and wide variety of marketers and resellers of it products and services 
product manufacturers  in particular  have implemented programs to sell directly to the business customer  particularly larger corporate customers and  thus  are a competitive threat to us 
in addition  manufacturers may attempt to increase the volume of software products distributed electronically to end users 
an increase in the volume of products sold through any of these competitive programs or distributed electronically to end users could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
additionally  product resellers and direct marketers are combining operations or acquiring or merging with other resellers and direct marketers to increase efficiency 
moreover  current and potential competitors have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to enhance their products and services 
accordingly  it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and acquire significant market share 
generally  pricing is very aggressive in the industry and we expect pricing pressures to continue 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to offset the effects of price reductions with an increase in the number of customers  higher net sales  cost reductions or otherwise 
price reductions by our competitors that we either cannot or choose not to match could result in an erosion of our market share and or reduced sales or  to the extent we match such reductions  could result in reduced operating margins  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents certain of our competitors in each of our operating segments have longer operating histories and greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than we do 
in addition  some of these competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or changing opportunities  technologies and customer requirements 
many current and potential competitors also have greater name recognition and engage in more extensive promotional activities  offer more attractive terms to customers and adopt more aggressive pricing policies than we do 
additionally  some of our competitors have lower operating cost structures  allowing them to profitably employ more aggressive pricing strategies 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively with current or future competitors or that the competitive pressures we face will not have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we rely on our suppliers for product availability  purchasing incentives and competitive products to sell 
we acquire products for resale both directly from manufacturers and indirectly through distributors 
the loss of a supplier could cause a short term disruption in the availability of products 
the reduction in the amount of credit granted to us by our suppliers could increase our cost of working capital and have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
additionally  there is no assurance that as manufacturers continue to sell directly to end users  they will not limit or curtail the availability of their product to resellers 
certain of the products offered from time to time by us may become subject to manufacturer allocation  which limits the number of units of such products available to us 
our inability to obtain a sufficient quantity of product or an allocation of products from a manufacturer in a way that favors one of our competitors relative to us could cause us to be unable to fill customers orders in a timely manner  or at all  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
certain manufacturers provide us with substantial incentives in the form of payment discounts  supplier reimbursements  price protections and rebates 
supplier funds are used to offset  among other things  cost of goods sold  marketing costs and other operating expenses 
no assurance can be given that we will continue to receive such incentives or that we will be able to collect outstanding amounts relating to these incentives in a timely manner  or at all 
a reduction in  the discontinuance of  a significant delay in receiving or the inability to collect such incentives could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
although product is available from multiple sources via the distribution channel as well as directly from manufacturers  we rely on the manufacturers of products we offer for not only product availability and supplier reimbursements  but also for development of products that compete effectively with products of manufacturers we do not currently offer  namely dell 
we rely on a limited number of outsourcing clients 
through our direct alliance operating segment which represented and of our consolidated net sales and earnings from operations  respectively  in  we perform business process outsourcing services for a small number of manufacturers in the computer and consumer electronics industry pursuant to various arrangements 
for the year ended december   one outsourcing client accounted for approximately of direct alliance s net sales 
for the year ended december   the top three clients represented of direct alliance s net sales 
although the contracts with these clients are generally multi year contracts  these clients may cancel their contracts under certain circumstances on relatively short notice  elect to not renew them upon expiration or renew them on terms that are less favorable to us 
there is no assurance that we will be able to replace any outsourcing clients that terminate or fail to renew their relationships with us or that we will be able to renew existing contracts on terms that are as favorable to us as the current terms 
additionally  we seek to expand our offerings both within and outside of the computer industry 
the failure to maintain current arrangements or the inability to enter into new ones within or outside the computer industry could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
substantially all of our current outsourcing clients are manufacturers in the computer industry  and  therefore  are subject to the same industry risks as we are with respect to our insight north america and insight uk operations 
these risks may negatively affect the amount of business our clients outsource to us 
disruptions in our information and telephone communication systems could affect our ability to service our customers and cause us to incur additional expenses 
we believe that our success to date has been  and future results of operations will be  dependent in large part upon our ability to provide prompt and efficient service to customers 
our ability to provide such services is largely dependent on the accuracy  quality and utilization of the information generated by our information systems  which affect our ability to manage our sales  distribution  inventories and accounting systems and the reliability of our telephone communication systems 
in january  we completed the it system conversion across all of insight s operations serving united states customers and will be making enhancements to the system during in  we intend to convert insight s united kingdom and canadian operations to this software platform 
there can be no assurances that these enhancements or conversions will not cause disruptions in our business  and any such disruption could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
although we have built redundancy into most of our systems  and have comprehensive data backup  we do not have a formal disaster recovery capability  therefore  a substantial interruption in our information systems or in our telephone communication systems would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents there are risks associated with international operations that are different than those inherent in the united states business 
we currently have operations in the united kingdom and canada and may expand operations further into europe 
in implementing our international strategy  we face barriers to entry and competition from local companies and other companies that already have established global businesses  as well as the risks generally associated with conducting business internationally 
these risks include local labor conditions and regulations  the ability to attract and retain suitable local management  exposure to currency fluctuations  limitations on foreign investment and the additional expense and risks inherent in operating in geographically and culturally diverse locations 
because we may continue to develop our international business through acquisitions  we may also be subject to risks associated with such acquisitions  including those relating to the marriage of different corporate cultures and shared decision making 
there can be no assurance that we will succeed in increasing our international business or do so in a profitable manner 
we depend on certain key personnel 
our future success will be largely dependent on the efforts of key management personnel 
the loss of one or more of these key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we also recently stated our desire to enhance our executive management team through the addition of one or more seasoned executives  possibly including a new company president 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified executive personnel or that any such executive personnel  including a new company president  will be able to integrate into the company and lead it effectively in directions that will increase stockholder value 
we also believe that our future success will be largely dependent on our continued ability to attract and retain highly qualified management  sales and technical personnel 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract and retain such personnel 
volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price may also adversely affect our ability to retain key employees  all of whom have been granted stock options  or attract additional highly qualified personnel 
further  we make a significant investment in the training of our sales account executives 
our inability to retain such personnel or to train them rapidly enough to meet our expanding needs could cause a decrease in the overall quality and efficiency of our sales staff  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
rapid changes in product standards may result in substantial inventory obsolescence 
the it industry is characterized by rapid technological change and the frequent introduction of new products and product enhancements  which can decrease demand for current products or render them obsolete 
in addition  in order to satisfy customer demand  protect ourselves against product shortages  obtain greater purchasing discounts and react to changes in original equipment manufacturers terms and conditions  we may carry relatively high inventory levels of certain products that may have limited or no return privileges 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to avoid losses related to inventory obsolescence on these products 
the integration and operation of future acquired businesses may disrupt our business  create additional expenses and utilize cash or debt availability 
over the past few years  we completed acquisitions in the united states  the united kingdom and canada 
these acquired operations have been fully integrated and now comprise a material portion of our business 
our strategy includes the possible acquisition of other businesses to expand or complement our operations 
an acquisition involves numerous risks  including difficulties in the conversion of information systems and assimilation of operations of the acquired company  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  risks of entering markets in which we have had no or only limited direct experience  assumption of unknown liabilities and the potential loss of key employees and or customers of the acquired company  all of which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
the magnitude  timing and nature of any future acquisitions will depend on a number of factors  including the availability of suitable acquisition candidates  the negotiation of acceptable terms  our financial capabilities and general economic and business conditions 
there is no assurance that we will identify acquisition candidates that would result in successful combinations or that any such acquisitions will be consummated on acceptable terms 
any future acquisitions may result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurrence of additional debt  the utilization of cash  amortization of expenses related to identifiable intangible assets and future impairments of acquired goodwill  all of which could adversely affect our profitability 
our principal financing arrangement expires on december  and if we are unable to renew this arrangement or replace it on acceptable terms  we may incur higher interest expenses or your equity interest may be diluted 
our financing facilities include a million accounts receivable securitization financing arrangement  a million revolving line of credit and a million inventories financing facility 
the availability under each of these facilities is subject to formulas based on our eligible trade accounts receivable or inventories 
as of december   the aggregate outstanding balance under these facilities was million and we had million available 
the accounts receivable securitization financing arrangement expires december   and the line of credit and inventories facility each expire on december  we have no reason to believe the accounts receivable securitization financing arrangement will not be renewed on or before december  however  it is possible that we may be unable to renew our existing accounts receivable securitization financing arrangement or secure alternative financing or  if we are able to renew our existing accounts receivable securitization financing arrangement or secure alternative financing  it may be on less favorable terms  such as higher interest rates 
if we were unable to renew our existing accounts receivable securitization financing arrangement or secure alternative financing  we may be required to seek other financing alternatives such as selling additional equity 
table of contents securities or convertible debt securities that would dilute the equity interests of current stockholders 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such financing on terms favorable to us or at all 
recently enacted and proposed changes in securities laws and regulations will increase our costs and divert management s attention from operations 
the sarbanes oxley act of the act became law in july and has required changes in some of our corporate governance  public disclosure and compliance practices 
the act also requires the sec to promulgate new rules on a variety of subjects  some of which are already in place 
in addition  the nasd adopted revisions to its corporate governance requirements for companies  like us  that are listed on nasdaq 
to maintain high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure  we have invested and will continue to invest all reasonably necessary resources to comply with evolving standards 
this investment increases our legal and financial costs and diverts management time and attention from other activities 
the risk of litigation and claims of personal liability for corporate action or inaction could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain executive officers and qualified members for our board of directors  particularly to serve on the audit committee 
the results of litigation may affect our operating results 
from time to time we will be made defendants to lawsuits both in the ordinary course of business and as a result of other circumstances 
depending on the claims made and the nature of the relief sought  any such lawsuit  if decided against us  could adversely affect our results of operations 
we are a defendant in a lawsuit  which is a consolidation of three separate actions brought by stockholders  pending in the united states district court  district of arizona 
the lawsuit alleges  among others  violations of section b of the securities exchange act of and sec rule b the plaintiffs in this action allege we  and certain of our officers  made false and misleading statements pertaining to our business  operations and management in an effort to inflate the price of our common stock 
the lawsuit also names as co defendants eric j 
crown  the chairman of our board of directors  timothy a 
crown  our chief executive officer and president and a director  and stanley laybourne  our executive vice president  chief financial officer and treasurer and a director 
the plaintiffs seek class action status to represent all buyers of our common stock from september  through july  on september   the court granted our motion to dismiss plaintiffs amended complaint  but allowed plaintiffs leave to file an amended complaint  which they did on october  on january   we filed a motion to dismiss the second amended complaint  and the court is scheduled to hear oral argument on the motion to dismiss on may  we will continue to defend the case vigorously  however  there can be no assurances that the court will grant our motion to dismiss or that  if the cases are not dismissed  that we will prevail at trial 
no estimate for the costs of defense  other than the deductible amount under our directors and officers liability insurance policies has been included in our consolidated financial statements  and any award to plaintiffs in excess of coverage under our insurance policies would likely have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
changes in state sales tax collection increase the total amount we invoice customers 
effective september   we began collecting sales tax on sales to all of our customers  including the small to medium sized business customers  located in states that impose a sales and use tax 
this increased the total amount we charge to our customers in those states in which we did not previously collect sales tax and increases our administrative expenses 
although we have not experienced any material negative effects on net sales to date  this may deter current and potential customers from purchasing from us because not all resellers of it products and services charge sales tax in all states that impose a sales tax 
we may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims  which are costly to defend and could limit our ability to provide certain content or use certain technologies in the future 
many parties are actively developing search  indexing  e commerce and other web related technologies  as well as a variety of online business models and methods 
we believe that these parties will continue to take steps to protect these technologies  including  but not limited to  seeking patent protection 
as a result  disputes regarding the ownership of these technologies and rights associated with online business are likely to arise in the future 
in addition to existing patents and intellectual property rights  we anticipate that additional third party patents related to our services will be issued in the future 
from time to time  parties assert patent infringement claims against us in the form of cease and desist letters  lawsuits and other communications if there is a determination that we have infringed the proprietary rights of others  we could incur substantial monetary liability  be forced to stop selling infringing products or providing infringing services  be required to enter into costly royalty or licensing agreements  if available  or be prevented from using the rights  which could force us to change our business practices in the future 
as a result  these types of claims could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we issue options under our stock option plans and sell shares under our employee stock purchase plan  which dilute the interest of stockholders and may result in future compensation expense 
we have reserved shares of our common stock for issuance under our employee stock purchase plan  our long term incentive plan the ltip and our broad based incentive plan 
as approved by our stockholders  our ltip provides that additional shares may be reserved for issuance based on a formula contained in that plan 
the formula provides that the total number of shares of common stock remaining for grant under the ltip and any of our other option plans  plus the number of shares subject to unexercised options granted under any stock plan  shall not exceed of the outstanding shares of our common stock at the time of calculation of the additional shares 
therefore  we will reserve additional shares on an ongoing basis for issuance under this plan 
at december   we had options outstanding to acquire  shares of common stock with a 
table of contents weighted average exercise price of 
based on the ltip formula  we had  shares of common stock available for grant of stock options at december  additionally  we have reserved shares of common stock of our subsidiaries  direct alliance corporation and plusnet technologies limited under the direct alliance long term incentive plan and the plusnet technologies limited long term incentive plan 
the amount of shares reserved for issuance under these plans represents of the outstanding stock of the respective subsidiaries 
at december   we had options outstanding to acquire  shares of common stock of direct alliance corporation at a weighted average exercise price of and options to acquire  shares of common stock of plusnet technologies limited at a weighted average exercise price of 
when stock options with an exercise price lower than the current market price are exercised  our stockholders will experience dilution in the price of their shares and may experience a dilution of earnings per share due to the increased number of shares outstanding 
also  the terms upon which we will be able to obtain equity capital may be affected  because the holders of outstanding options can be expected to exercise them at a time when we would  in all likelihood  be able to obtain needed capital on terms more favorable to us than those provided in outstanding options 
our stock price has experienced volatility 
the price for our common stock has experienced in the past  and could experience in the future  substantial volatility as a result of a number of factors  including quarterly increases or decreases in net sales  gross profit or earnings  and changes in our business  operations or prospects of any of our segments  announcements by us  our competitors or our vendors  changes in net sales or earnings estimates by the investment community  and general economic conditions 
the stock market has also experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations  which have affected the market price of many companies and which at times have been unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies whose stock is traded 
broad market fluctuations  developments in the it industry  general economic conditions and political and current events may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
in addition  if our current security holders sell substantial amounts of our common stock  including shares issued upon acquisitions or exercise of outstanding options  in the public market  the market price of our common stock could decline 
some anti takeover provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation  bylaws and stockholders rights agreement  as well as provisions of delaware law and executive employment contracts  could impair a takeover attempt 
we have provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws which could have the effect separately  or in combination of rendering more difficult or discouraging an acquisition deemed undesirable by our board of directors 
these include provisions authorizing blank check preferred stock  which could be issued with voting  liquidation  dividend and other rights superior to our common stock  limiting the liability of  and providing indemnification to  directors and officers  limiting the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings  requiring advance notice of stockholder proposals for business to be conducted at meetings of our stockholders and for nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors  controlling the procedures for conduct of board and stockholder meetings and election and removal of directors  and specifying that stockholders may take action only at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders 
these provisions  alone or together  could deter or delay hostile takeovers  proxy contests and changes in control or management 
as a delaware corporation  we are also subject to provisions of delaware law  including section of the delaware general corporation law  which prevents some stockholders from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of the holders of substantially all of our outstanding common stock 
on december   each stockholder of record received one preferred share purchase right right on each outstanding share of common stock owned 
each right entitles stockholders to buy 
of a share of our series a preferred stock at an exercise price of 
the rights will be exercisable if a person or group acquires or more of our common stock or announces a tender offer for or more of the common stock 
should this occur  the right will entitle its holder to purchase  at the right s exercise price  a number of shares of common stock having a market value at the time of twice the right s exercise price 
rights held by the holder will become void and will not be exercisable to purchase shares at the bargain purchase price 
if we are acquired in a merger or other business combination transaction after a person acquires or more of the our common stock  each right will entitle its holder to purchase at the right s then current exercise price a number of the acquiring company s common shares having a market value at the time of twice the right s exercise price 

table of contents additionally  we have employment agreements with certain officers and employees under which severance payments would become payable pursuant to a change in control 
in the event these severance payments under the current employment agreements  were to become payable  the maximum contingent severance payment calculated as of december  would be approximately million 
any provision of our certificate of incorporation  bylaws or employment agreements  or delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock and also could affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock 
sales of additional common stock and securities convertible into our common stock may dilute the voting power of current holders 
we may issue equity securities in the future whose terms and rights are superior to those of our common stock 
our certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to  shares of preferred stock 
these are blank check preferred shares  meaning our board of directors is authorized to designate and issue the shares from time to time without stockholder consent 
no preferred shares are outstanding and we currently do not intend to issue any shares of preferred stock in the foreseeable future 
any shares of preferred stock that may be issued in the future could be given voting and conversion rights that could dilute the voting power and equity of existing holders of shares of common stock and have preferences over shares of common stock with respect to dividends and liquidation rights 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have interest rate exposure arising from our financing arrangements  which have variable interest rates 
these variable interest rates are affected by changes in short term interest rates 
we manage interest rate exposure by maintaining a conservative debt to equity ratio 
at december   the fair value of our long term debt approximated its carrying value 
on october   we prepaid million of building mortgages  with fixed interest rates ranging from to  with borrowings from existing financing arrangements 
after this prepayment  substantially all of our debt has variable interest rates 
we believe that the effect  if any  of reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows should not be material 
our financing arrangements expose net earnings to changes in short term interest rates since interest rates on the underlying obligations are variable 
borrowings outstanding under the interest bearing financing arrangements totaled million at december  a change in net earnings resulting from a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates would not be material 
we also have foreign currency translation exposure arising from the operation of foreign entities 
we monitor our foreign currency exposure and may from time to time enter into hedging transactions to manage this exposure 
there were no hedging transactions during the year ended december  or hedging instruments outstanding at december
