item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
you should read the following discussion and analysis together with our financial statements  related notes and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report 
in addition to historical information  the following discussion and other parts of this report contain forward looking information that involves risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by such forward looking information due to competitive factors and other factors discussed under forward looking statements below and under important factors that may affect future results in exhibit to this annual report on form k 
overview we are a world leader in the development  manufacture  and application of innovative vacuum technology solutions for the semiconductor  data storage  and flat panel display markets 
our vacuum systems provide enabling technology for several key steps within the semiconductor manufacturing process  including ion implantation  physical vapor deposition  chemical vapor deposition and etching 
semiconductor manufacturers use our systems to create and maintain a vacuum environment  which is critical to their manufacturing processes 
we are a leading provider of vacuum systems technology to the world s largest semiconductor capital equipment and semiconductor manufacturers  placing us at a critical point in their advanced technology manufacturing process 
we have long standing customer relationships with many semiconductor capital equipment manufacturers  including applied materials  axcelis  novellus  unaxis  varian semiconductor and veeco  as well as semiconductor manufacturers such as agere  amd  atmel  fuj itsu  infineon  intel  motorola  nec  philips  samsung  stmicroelectronics  texas instruments  and tsmc 
our products are also used in a broad range of industrial manufacturing applications and advanced research and development laboratories 
we also provide an extensive range of global support and vacuum system monitoring services that lower our end users total costs of ownership 
we increase our customers system uptime through rapid response to potential operating problems 
we also develop and deliver enhancements to our customers installed base of production tools 
our service offerings include our trueblue service agreements  our guts guaranteed up time support customer response system and our innovative goldlink global on line diagnostics support system  which provides a remote e diagnostics solution that allows us to monitor  in real time  the vacuum system performance of our customers production tools 
our goldlink capability has made us a leading total solution provider in the emerging market for internet based  proactive e diagnostics for the semiconductor and semiconductor capital equipment industries 
the principal market we serve is the global semiconductor capital equipment industry  a highly cyclical business 
as a result  we have experienced significant variations in net sales  expenses  and results of operations in the periods presented and such variations are likely to continue 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  adequacy of reserves  valuation of investments and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical and anticipated results and trends and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  including assumptions as to future events 
these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
by their natu re  estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
actual results may differ from our estimates 
we believe that the following significant accounting policies and assumptions may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity than others 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable 
we recognize net sales from product sales upon shipment provided title and risk of loss have been transferred to the customer  there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  fees are fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
net sales from global support services is recognized as performed or ratably over the period of the related agreements 
we recognize net sales from upgrade sales upon customer acceptance provided installation has been completed 
revenues from contracts with multiple element arrangements  such as those including products and services  are recognized as each element is earned based on the relative fair value of each element 
amounts billed to customers that relate to shipping costs are included in net sales and in cost of sales 
as part of a sale  we offer customers a warranty on defects in materials and workmanship 
page we continuously monitor and track the related product returns and record a provision for the estimated amount of such future returns  based on historical experience and any notification we receive of pending returns 
while such returns have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same return rates that we have in the past 
any significant increase in material and workmanship defect rates and the resulting credit returns could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the period or periods in which such returns materialize 
we also maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory and reserves for excess and obsolescence 
we value inventory at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision to write down inventory to its estimated net realizable value  if less than cost  based upon management s assumptions of future material usage and obsolescence  which are a result of future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions become less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory provisions may be required 
if inventory is written down to its net realizable value and subsequently there is an increased demand for the inventory at a higher value  the increased value of the inventory is not realized until the inventory is sold  which will result in improved margins in the period which the product is sold 
tax contingencies 
tax contingencies are recorded to address potential exposures involving tax positions we have taken that could be challenged by taxing authorities 
these potential exposures result from the varying application of statutes  rules  regulations and interpretations 
our estimate of the value of our tax contingencies contains assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions 
it is possible that the ultimate resolution of these matters may be greater or less than the amount that we have accrued 
deferred income taxes 
each reporting period we estimate our ability to realize our net deferred tax assets 
realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent upon our generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate tax jurisdictions in future years to obtain benefit from the reversal of net deductible temporary differences and from tax loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we reassessed our need for a valuation allowance and determined under applicable accounting criteria that a full valuation allowance was required in until an appropriate level of profitability is reached  we will not record federal tax benefits or provisions on future results of operations 
restructuring charges 
during we recorded charges in connection with our restructuring programs 
the related reserves reflect estimates  including those pertaining to severance costs and settlements of contractual obligations 
we reassess the reserve requirements to complete each individual plan under our restructuring programs at the end of each reporting period 
actual experience may be different from these estimates 
for more information  see note c to the consolidated financial statements 
retirement obligations 
we have retirement obligations that are developed from actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions  including discount rates  rates of compensation increases  and expected long term rates of return on plan assets  which are usually updated on an annual basis at the beginning of each fiscal year 
we are required to consider current market conditions  including changes in interest rates  in making these assumptions 
changes in the related retirement benefit costs may occur due to changes in assumptions 
investments 
we own of a joint venture  ulvac cryogenics  inc  or uci  which manufactures and sells cryogenic vacuum pumps in japan  principally to ulvac corporation 
we account for the joint venture using the equity method of accounting  and we also receive royalties from the joint venture under the terms of a license and technology agreement 
the royalties we receive from uci  as well as our equity in the income and losses of uci  are both included in our financial statements under joint venture income 
results of operations fiscal year ended december   compared to the fiscal year ended december  for most of  we continued to experience the significant slowdown in the global market for semiconductor capital equipment that began in in the last quarter of the year  however  we have seen an increase in both orders and sales as the industry begins to show signs of expansion 
net sales for were million as compared with net sales for of million  an increase of 
in the fourth quarter of  we initiated a worldwide cost reduction program and the suspension of an internal use software development program in response to the continued duration and severity of the slowdown in the semiconductor capital equipment industry 
the cost reduction program included severance and fringe benefits to terminate approximately employees and included closure or consolidation of selected facilities worldwide 
we recorded an million charge for restructurings and other charges in the fourth quarter of and expect to save approximately million quarterly which has significantly reduced our breakeven point 
this program was substantially completed in the first quarter of page cost of sales for was million compared with million for  a decrease of 
the gross margin for was compared with for the improvement in gross margin for is primarily due to the lower overhead costs resulting from our cost reduction actions taken in the fourth quarter of  offset by some temporary increases in production and customer support costs incurred in the middle of the year relating to our new generation of vacuum technology 
research and development expenses were million for  or of net sales  compared to million for  or of net sales 
the decrease in overall research and development expenses from the prior year is due to cost reduction actions taken in the fourth quarter of  as well as the completion of several major research and development projects during the past year 
we maintain a commitment to developing technologies to support a new generation of products for millimeter capable production tools  to expand our support service capability and to improve our core component product lines 
total selling  general and administrative expenses for were million  as compared with million for excluding the million nonrecurring litigation charge included in  total selling  general and administrative expenses declined from the prior year by  reflecting cost savings realized from the restructuring program implemented in the fourth quarter of royalty and equity income from our joint venture in japan for increased to million from million in the improvement over reflects improvement in the flat panel display portion of the semiconductor capital equipment market 
interest and other income was million for both and this reflects higher average cash balances offset by lower interest rates 
we had a pretax loss of million in  compared with a pretax loss of million for in we recorded an income tax provision of million 
this provision is primarily attributable to the establishment of the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets in accordance with sfas  accounting for income taxes and to record state and foreign income taxes for if we generate future taxable income domestically against which these tax attributes may be applied  some portion or all of the valuation allowance would be reversed and increase net income reported in future periods 
the effective tax rate for was 
the tax rates differ from the us statutory rate primarily due to tax credits and undistributed nontaxable equity income from our joint venture 
these tax credits and equity income increase our tax rate on pretax losses and decrease our tax rate on pretax income 
fiscal year ended december   compared to the fiscal year ended december  in  we experienced a significant slowdown in the global market for semiconductor capital equipment that began in net sales for were million as compared with net sales for of million  a decrease of 
cost of sales for was million compared with million for  a decrease of 
the gross margin for was compared with for cost of sales for included an additional fourth quarter charge for excess and obsolete inventory totaling million resulting from the significant slowdown in the global market for semiconductor capital equipment and from expected efficiencies to be gained in our future delivery of global customer support 
we monitor and forecast expected inventory needs based on our constantly changing sales forecast and write down or write off inventory when it becomes obsolete or when it is deemed excess 
excluding these charges  the gross margin for would have been  a decline from  primarily due to lower sales volume that reduced utilization of manufacturing capacity 
research and development expenses were million for  or of net sales  compared to million for  or of net sales 
we maintain a commitment to developing technologies to support a new generation of products for millimeter capable production tools  to expand our support service capability and to improve our core component product lines 
total selling  general and administrative expenses for were million  as compared with million for the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily due to the nonrecurring litigation settlement charge of million in total selling  general and administrative expenses excluding the nonrecurring litigation settlement charge remained consistent with the prior year  reflecting a decrease in spending due to the restructuring program completed in the third quarter of offset by an increase in depreciation expense associated with our new global information system and associated startup costs 
restructurings and other charges recorded during the fourth quarter of were associated with the initiation of a worldwide cost reduction program and the suspension of an internal use software development program in response to the continued duration and severity of the slowdown in the semiconductor capital equipment industry 
the million charged to restructurings and other charges is comprised of million of employee severance costs  million to consolidate leased facilities  and million to write off certain software 
page the employee costs of million primarily consist of severance and fringe benefits to terminate approximately employees 
the affected employees  most of whom were located in the united states  were primarily full time nonmanufacturing employees 
notification and termination benefits were communicated to employees in the fourth quarter of the majority of the terminations took place in  and most of the remaining terminations occurred in the first quarter of we realized approximately million in quarterly savings from the reduction in force 
the million of net exit costs related to facility closures resulted from the planned consolidation of customer support facilities located in massachusetts  facility reductions of satellite sales and customer support facilities located in texas  arizona  and california  and consolidation of sales and service centers located in japan 
these accrued costs reflect payments required under operating lease contracts in excess of expected sub lease rentals and costs for writing down related leasehold improvements at the affected facilities 
the consolidation of these facilities is expected to result in quarterly cost savings of approximately million 
we also suspended an internal use software development program given current market conditions and timing of market application  resulting in a million charge 
royalty and equity income from our joint venture in japan for decreased to million from million in due to the continued decline in the japanese semiconductor capital equipment market 
interest and other income was million for both and in  higher average cash  cash equivalent and investment balances resulting from the public offering completed in march were offset by lower interest rates 
we had a pretax loss of million in  resulting in a tax benefit of million  compared with a pretax loss of million and a tax benefit of million for the effective tax rates for and were and  respectively 
the tax rates differ from the us statutory rate primarily due to tax credits and undistributed nontaxable equity income from our joint venture 
these tax credits and equity income increase our tax rate on pretax losses and decrease our tax rate on pretax income 
the decline in the tax rate was primarily attributable to the decline in the benefit received from lower undistributed nontaxable equity income from our joint venture

in we spent million to support the existing infrastructure and the implementation of our global information system in our european operations  which went live in october in we spent million  principally for the implementation of our global information system in the us  which went live during july we continue to closely manage our capital expenditures 
cash dividends paid to our stockholders during were million  compared with million for we paid a quarterly common stock dividend of per share in after paying a quarterly dividend of per share for the first three quarters of  our board of directors reduced the quarterly dividend to per share in october  due to the continuing uncertain business environment and lack of visibility in the semiconductor capital equipment market 
we lease facilities and equipment under long term operating leases 
these contractual obligations entered into in the normal course of business are not required to be reflected in our consolidated balance sheets  but may impact our liquidity 
the following table outlines our future minimum lease payments under non cancelable operating leases 
less than more than totals year years years years operating leases we manage our foreign exchange rate risk arising from intercompany foreign currency denominated transactions through the use of foreign currency forward contracts 
the gains and losses on these transactions are not material 
we believe that our existing funds and anticipated cash flow from operations will satisfy our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months 
legal proceedings we may be involved in various legal proceedings in the normal course of business 
we are not a party to any proceedings that involve amounts that would have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations if such proceedings were resolved unfavorably 
recent accounting pronouncements in november  the eitf issued no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
eitf no 
addresses certain aspects of the accounting by a vendor for arrangements under which it will perform multiple revenue generating activities 
eitf no 
establishes three principles revenue should be recognized separately for separate units of accounting  revenue for a separate unit of accounting should be recognized only when the arrangement consideration is reliably measurable and the earnings process is substantially complete  and consideration should be allocated among the separate units of accounting in an arrangement based on their fair values 
we adopted the provisions of eitf no 
for all revenue arrangements entered into after june  the adoption of eitf no 
did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
in january  the fasb issued fin no 
consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb fin no 
provides guidance on the identification of entities for which control is achieved through means other than through voting rights called variable interest entities or vies and how to determine when and which business enterprise should consolidate the vie the primary beneficiary 
this new model for consolidation applies to an entity in which either the equity investors if any do not have a controlling financial interest or the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity s activities without receiving additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
in addition  fin no 
requires that both the primary beneficiary and all other enterprises with a significant variable interest in a vie make additional disclosures 
we do not have any interests that would change our current reporting entity or require additional disclosure out lined in fin no 
page in april  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement amends sfas to provide clarification on the financial accounting and reporting of derivative instruments and hedging activities and requires contracts with similar characteristics to be accounted for on a comparable basis 
the adoption of sfas  which is effective for contracts entered into or modified after june   did not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised sfas  employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits  that improves financial statement disclosures for defined benefit plans 
the change replaces existing sfas disclosure requirements for pensions and other postretirement benefits and revises employers disclosures about pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans 
it does not change the measurement of recognition of those plans required by sfas  employers accounting for pensions  sfas  employers accounting for settlements and curtailments of defined benefit pension plans and for termination benefits  and sfas revised retains the disclosure requirements contained in the original sfas  but requires additional disclosures about the plan assets  obligations  cash flows  and net periodic benefit cost of defined benefit pension plans and other defined benefit postretirement plans 
sfas re vised is effective for annual and interim periods with fiscal years ending after december  we have adopted the revised disclosure provisions 
forward looking statements this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements appear principally in the sections entitled business and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
forward looking statements may appear in other sections of this report as well 
generally  the forward looking statements in this report use words like expect  anticipate  plan  intend  believe  seek  estimate  and similar expressions 
the forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  statements regarding our strategic plans  the outlook for our business and industry  anticipated sources of future revenues  anticipated expenses  spending and savings from our cost reduction program  anticipated levels of capital expenditures  and the sufficiency of capital to meet working capital and capital expenditure requirements 
forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks  uncertainties  and assumptions 
important factors that could cause our future results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by us or on our behalf include  but are not limited to  market acceptance of and demand for the company s products  the success of the company s strategic initiatives  including its global support operations and new product introductions  the health of the global semiconductor capital equipment market and the timing and scope of any change in the current industry conditions  the company s success in sustaining order bookings  and the other risk factors contained in exhibit to this annual report on form k 
as a result of the foregoing  we may experience material fluctuations in our operating results on a quarterly basis  which could materially affect our business  financial position  results of operations and stock price 
we undertake no obl igation to update the information contained in this report to reflect subsequently occurring events or circumstances 
page item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange rate risk a portion of our business is conducted outside the united states through our foreign subsidiaries 
our foreign subsidiaries maintain their accounting records in their local currencies 
consequently  fluctuations in exchange rates affect the period to period comparability of results 
to reduce the risks associated with foreign currency rate fluctuations  we have entered into forward exchange contracts on a continuing basis to offset the currency exposures 
the gains and losses on these transactions partially offset the unrealized and realized foreign exchange gains and losses of the underlying exposures 
the net gains and losses were immaterial for the years presented and were included in cost of sales 
we plan to continue to use forward exchange contracts to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations 
the notional amount of our outstanding foreign currency contracts at december   was million 
the potential fair value loss for a hypothetical adverse change in forward currency exchange rates at december   would be million  which would be essentially offset by corresponding gains related to underlying assets 
the potential loss was estimated calculating the fair value of the forward exchange contracts at december   and comparing that with the value calculated using the hypothetical forward currency exchange rates 
credit risk we are exposed to concentration of credit risk in cash and cash equivalents  investments  trade receivables  and short term foreign exchange forward contracts 
we place our cash and cash equivalents with our primary bank  a major financial institution with a high quality credit rating 
our investments consist of money market funds  municipal and other tax free bonds  or investment grade securities 
we enter into short term foreign currency exchange contracts with our primary bank
