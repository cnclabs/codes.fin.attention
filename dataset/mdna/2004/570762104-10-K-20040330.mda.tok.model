item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis relates to factors that have affected our consolidated financial condition and results of operations for the three years ended december   and certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the presentation used in in conjunction with the following discussion and analysis  you should also read our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto and the selected financial data included elsewhere in this form k  which are incorporated herein by reference 
recent developments during the year ended december   we completed several important initiatives that accomplished the transformation of markwest hydrocarbon into a company focused on increasing shareholder value through our ownership in markwest energy partners 
specifically  we discontinued our exploration and production business and significantly grew markwest energy partners  primarily through the acquisition of third party midstream assets 
markwest hydrocarbon dispositions our three primary dispositions were the following we sold our san juan basin oil and gas producing properties in two separate sales during the second and third quarters of the san juan basin properties represented substantially all of our exploration and production business located in the united states 
net proceeds from the sales were approximately million 
we recognized a net pretax gain on the sales of approximately million 
we sold our entire canadian exploration and production business in two separate transactions during december net proceeds from the sales were approximately million 
we recognized a net pretax loss on the sales of approximately million 
we sold two of our three ngl terminals during the third quarter of net proceeds were approximately million 
we recognized a net pretax loss on the sales of less than million 
markwest energy partners acquisitions pinnacle merger 
on march   we completed the acquisition of pinnacle natural gas company  or pinnacle 
the aggregate purchase price of million was comprised of million in cash plus the assumption of million of bank indebtedness 
the assets are primarily located in texas and include three lateral natural gas pipelines and twenty natural gas gathering systems 
one of the gathering systems was subsequently disposed of in december for an immaterial amount 
the three lateral natural gas pipelines consist of approximately miles of pipeline that deliver natural gas under firm contracts to power plants 
the nineteen natural gas gathering systems gathered an aggregate of approximately mmcf d of natural gas during the year ended december   and have a capacity of approximately mmcf d 
this acquisition provided markwest energy partners with a new area for growth in the southwest and diversified its lines of business and revenues 
in addition  the acquisition is expected to increase the stability of the partnership s cash flows because pinnacle has a high percentage of fee based lateral pipeline contracts 
lubbock pipeline acquisition 
effective september   markwest energy partners completed the acquisition of an intrastate gas transmission pipeline and related assets near lubbock  texas  from power tex joint venture  a subsidiary of conocophillips  for million in cash 
this gas pipeline is the only connection between the northern natural gas and el paso interstate pipelines and the city of lubbock 
its customers include the city of lubbock  texas tech university  xcel energy and several other end use consumers 
this acquisition allowed the partnership to further expand its operations in the southwest with an additional lateral system while providing an added source of fee based cash flows 
western oklahoma acquisition 
on december   markwest energy partners completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of american central western oklahoma gas company  llc for approximately million in cash 
these assets include miles of natural gas gathering pipeline  known as the foss lake gathering system  and the associated arapaho gas processing plant in western oklahoma 
the foss lake gathering system  which has a current capacity of mmcf d  connects to approximately wells 
the arapaho gas processing plant has a current capacity of mmcf d 
capacity on the gathering system can be expanded to mmcf d with additional compression 
by establishing a presence in oklahoma  this acquisition significantly expanded the partnership s southwest operations 
michigan crude pipeline acquisition 
on december   the partnership completed the acquisition of approximately miles of intrastate crude oil gathering pipeline  for million in cash 
the pipeline serves over  oil and gas wells on the niagaran reef trend and has  barrels of storage capacity in storage tanks 
this acquisition further diversifies the partnership s lines of business with the addition of crude oil gathering and transportation services 
the acquisition also provides the partnership with the opportunity to leverage off its existing infrastructure and personnel in michigan while adding additional fee based cash flows 
initial and secondary public offerings of markwest energy partners  lp initial public offering on may   markwest hydrocarbon contributed most of the assets  liabilities and operations of our midstream business to markwest energy partners  lp in exchange for  subordinated units  a general partner interest in the partnership  incentive distribution rights as defined in the partnership agreement  and million in cash which was used to pay down bank debt 
the partnership closed its initial public offering on that date selling  common units including the underwriters exercise of their over allotment option for gross proceeds of million and net proceeds after fees and expenses of million 
concurrent with its initial public offering the partnership borrowed million 
markwest energy partners limited partnership structure reduces its cost of capital thereby enhancing its ability to grow more efficiently 
secondary public offering on january   the partnership priced its offering of  common units at per unit 
of the  common units   were sold by the partnership for gross proceeds of million 
the remaining  were sold by certain selling unitholders  proceeds of which have been retained by them  and not the partnership 
by the terms of the over allotment provisions of the underwriting agreement  the partnership granted underwriters a day option to purchase up to  additional common units 
in connection therewith  the partnership issued an additional  common units for gross proceeds of million during the first quarter of gross proceeds of million were reduced by underwriters fees of million and professional fees and other offering costs of million  resulting in net proceeds of million 
the net proceeds were used to pay down the partnership s credit facility 
as of february   markwest hydrocarbon s partnership interests consisted of the following  subordinated units  representing a limited partner interest in the partnership  and a ownership interest in the general partner of the partnership 
the general partner owns a general partner interest in the partnership 
markwest hydrocarbon s consolidated financial statements reflect the consolidation of markwest energy partners  with the public unitholders interest being reflected as a minority interest in the consolidated statement of operations and the consolidated balance sheet 
results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenues 
revenues were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
the increase was primarily due to markwest energy partners acquisitions  which added approximately million 
increases in our weighted average ngl product sales prices in appalachia were generally offset by decreases in our appalachian ngl and gas marketing sales volumes 
included in our revenues were approximately million in hedging losses  primarily from crude oil hedges  an increase of approximately million over the prior year 
purchased product costs 
purchased product costs were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
purchased product costs increased in primarily due to markwest energy partners acquisitions added approximately million 
an increase in the weighted average price of our appalachian replacement natural gas from our keep whole and percent of proceeds contract based business increased purchased product costs million 
a decrease in the level of gas marketing activity offset the above increases by approximately million 
facility expenses 
facility expenses were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
facility expenses increased primarily due to markwest energy partners acquisitions 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
the increase is principally attributable to markwest energy partners acquisitions  the incremental  public company costs from markwest energy partners first full year of operations in  and compensation expense related to phantom units granted to our employees 
depreciation 
depreciation was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
the increase was principally due to markwest energy partners acquisitions 
impairment 
markwest energy partners recorded an impairment of million related to its cobb processing facility 
the facility is slated to be replaced in mid  at which time the current facility will be retired 
the cobb facility was written down to its estimated recoverable value 
no impairment was recorded during the year ended december  interest expense  net 
interest expense was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
the increase was primarily attributable to borrowings by markwest energy partners to finance its acquisitions 
write down of deferred financing costs 
write down of deferred financing costs was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or 
the write down eliminated the remaining deferred financing costs associated with the markwest hydrocarbon credit facility that was terminated in december income from discontinued operations 
income from discontinued operations was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
the increase is primarily attributable to the net gain on sales of our oil and gas properties during year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenue 
revenue was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or 
revenue was lower in than in primarily due to a decrease in the average ngl product sales price from our keep whole contract  or frac spread  business  net of volume increases  which accounted for approximately million of the overall decrease 
the average ngl sales price was per gallon for the year ended december   compared to per gallon for the year ended december   a decrease of per gallon  or 
we recognized a million hedging ineffectiveness charge in a decrease in gas marketing revenues  which accounted for approximately million of the decrease 
gas marketing revenues declined in as natural gas prices retreated from above average levels that existed in  more than offsetting volume increases 
a net million decrease from our michigan operations  primarily a function of the sales of an unusual amount of ngl products in the first quarter of purchased gas costs 
purchased gas costs were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or 
purchased gas costs were lower in primarily due to a decrease in our gas marketing cost of goods sold  which accounted for million of the overall decrease 
gas marketing costs declined in as natural gas prices retreated from above average levels that existed in  more than offsetting volume increases 
a net million decrease from our michigan operations  primarily a function of the sales of an unusual amount of ngl products in the first quarter of facility expenses 
facility expenses were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
the increase primarily stems from the incremental  public company costs from our consolidated subsidiary  markwest energy partners  which closed its ipo on may  depreciation 
depreciation was million for the year ended december   compared to million  for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
interest expense  net 
net interest expense was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
income from discontinued operations 
income from discontinued operations was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or 
the decrease was primarily a result of increased depletion expense during write down of deferred financing costs 
we wrote off million in deferred financing costs as a result of the may  amendment of our credit facility which was completed concurrently with the ipo of our consolidated subsidiary  markwest energy partners and an earlier amendment 
gain on sale of non operating assets 
during november  we sold  of our subordinated units of markwest energy partners to a third party 
seasonality a portion of our revenue and  as a result  our gross margin  is dependent upon the sales prices of natural gas and ngl products  particularly propane  and the purchase price of natural gas which fluctuate with winter weather conditions  and other supply and demand determinants 
the strongest demand for propane  which increases sales volumes  and the highest propane sales margins generally occur during the winter heating season 
as a result  we historically recognize a substantial portion of our annual income during the first and fourth quarters of the year 
liquidity and capital resources markwest hydrocarbon during  we discontinued our exploration and production activities and sold all of our related canadian oil and gas properties and substantially all of our us oil and gas properties 
the sales netted us million in cash 
the proceeds were primarily used to pay off and terminate our existing credit facility in its entirety in december we also had million in unrestricted cash on hand at december   exclusive of markwest energy partners cash on hand 
as a result  our outstanding debt  exclusive of markwest energy partners debt  was as of december  in february  we disbursed approximately million to pay a special one time dividend of per share to our common shareholders 
going forward  we expect markwest hydrocarbon s primary sources of liquidity to be quarterly distributions received from markwest energy partners and cash flows generated from operations  principally the marketing of natural gas and ngls 
we own of the general partner of markwest energy partners 
the general partner of markwest energy partners owns the general partner interest and all of the incentive distribution rights 
the incentive distribution rights entitle us to receive an increasing percentage of cash distributed by the partnership as certain target distribution levels are reached 
specifically  they entitle us to receive of all cash distributed in a quarter after each unit has received for that quarter  of all cash distributed after each unit has received for that quarter and of all cash distributed after each unit has received for that quarter 
for the year ended december   we received million in distributions for our subordinated units  and the general partner received million  including million representing payments on incentive distribution rights 
as the partnership continues to grow and increase its quarterly distributions per limited partner unit  we expect our distributions to increase accordingly 
cash flows generated from our marketing operations are subject to volatility in energy prices  especially prices for ngls and natural gas 
our cash flows are enhanced in periods when the prices received for ngls are high relative to the price of natural gas we purchase to satisfy our keep whole contractual arrangements in appalachia  and are reduced in periods when the prices received for ngls are low relative to the price of natural gas we purchase to satisfy such contractual arrangements 
under keep whole contracts  we retain and sell the ngls produced in our processing operations for third party producers  and then reimburse or keep whole the producers for the btu content of the ngls removed through the re delivery to the producers of an equivalent amount on a btu basis of dry natural gas 
generally  the value of the ngls extracted is greater than the cost of replacing those btus with dry gas  resulting in positive operating margins under these contracts 
periodically  when natural gas becomes more expensive  on a btu equivalent basis  than ngl products  the cost of keeping the producer whole can result in operating losses 
for the year ended december   our loss from continuing operations before income taxes was million 
the loss from operations was primarily caused by the combination of an unfavorable pricing environment primarily in the first half of and unfavorable crude oil hedges throughout 
however  prices improved during the latter half of and remained at or above historical levels into the first quarter of additionally  we exited certain unfavorable crude oil hedges in late we  however  cannot predict with any certainty what the pricing environment will be in the future 
we believe that cash on hand  cash received from quarterly distributions including the incentive distribution rights from markwest energy partners  and cash generated from our marketing operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements and fund our required capital expenditures  if any  for the foreseeable future 
most of our future capital expenditures are discretionary and minimal in nature 
during  we have budgeted million for our contribution to the cobb plant replacement and an additional million for other miscellaneous projects 
cash generated from our marketing operations will depend on our operating performance  which will be affected by prevailing commodity prices and other factors  some of which are beyond our control 
in an effort to increase our liquidity  we may seek to establish a bank credit facility and renegotiate certain keep whole contracts in order to reduce our commodity price risk 
markwest energy partners for the partnership  future acquisitions or projects are expected to be financed through a combination of debt and issuance of additional units  as is common practice with master limited partnerships 
as of december   the partnership had borrowed million of the million available under its credit facility 
the partnership paid down its debt by million in january with the proceeds from its secondary offering 
cash flows year ended december  in thousands net cash provided by used for operating activities   net cash provided by used for investing activities   net cash provided by used for financing activities   net cash used in operations during resulted primarily from losses from operations 
net cash provided by operations increased during relative to primarily because represented the first full year of our canadian operations 
net cash flows used in investing activities increased during relative to principally due to cash paid for the partnership s acquisitions net of proceeds from dispositions 
net cash used in investing activities decreased in relative to due to cash paid for our canadian acquisitions 
net cash provided by financing activities during was primarily a result of borrowing by the partnership to fund its acquisitions 
net cash used in financing activities in was primarily the result of using the proceeds from the partnership s initial public offering to pay down debt 
net cash provided by financing activities in was principally due to borrowings used to finance our two canadian acquisitions 
total contractual cash obligations a summary of our total contractual cash obligations as of december   is as follows payment due by period type of obligation total obligation due in due in due in thereafter long term debt   operating leases      total contractual cash obligations    credit facility you should read note of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k  which is incorporated herein by reference  for information on our financing facilities

critical accounting policies the selection and application of accounting policies is an important process that has developed as our business activities have evolved and as the accounting rules have developed 
accounting rules generally do not involve a selection among alternatives  but involve an implementation and interpretation of existing rules  and the use of judgment  to the specific set of circumstances existing in our business 
we make every effort to properly comply with all applicable rules on or before their adoption  and we believe the proper implementation and consistent application of the accounting rules is critical 
our critical accounting policies are discussed below 
you should also read note of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k  which is incorporated herein by reference 
impairment of long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we evaluate our long lived assets excluding the full cost pool  including related intangibles  of identifiable business activities for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate  in management s judgment  that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
the determination of whether impairment has occurred is based on management s estimate of undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the assets as compared to the carrying value of the assets 
if impairment has occurred  the amount of the impairment recognized is determined by estimating the fair value for the assets and recording a provision for loss if the carrying value is greater than fair value 
for assets identified to be disposed of in the future  the carrying value of these assets is compared to the estimated fair value less the cost to sell to determine if impairment is required 
until the assets are disposed of  an estimate of the fair value is re determined when related events or circumstances change 
when determining whether impairment of one of our long lived assets has occurred  we must estimate the undiscounted cash flows attributable to the asset or asset group 
our estimate of cash flows is based on assumptions regarding the volume of reserves behind the asset and future ngl product and natural gas prices 
the amount of reserves and drilling activity are dependent in part on natural gas prices 
projections of reserves and future commodity prices are inherently subjective and contingent upon a number of variable factors  including  but not limited to changes in general economic conditions in regions in which our products are located 
the availability and prices of ngl products and competing commodities 
the availability and prices of raw natural gas supply 
the availability and prices of crude oil 
our ability to negotiate favorable marketing agreements 
the risks that third party oil and gas exploration and production activities will not occur or be successful 
our dependence on certain significant customers  producers  gatherers  treaters  and transporters of natural gas 
competition from other midstream service providers  processors  including major energy companies 
any significant variance in any of the above assumptions or factors could materially affect our cash flows  which could require us to record an impairment of an asset 
commodity price risk management activities we account for price risk management activities based upon the fair value accounting methods prescribed by sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments 
risk management activities include utilizing various hedging contracts and other derivatives to reduce volatility in our cash flow 
sfas no 
requires that we determine the fair value of the instruments we use in these business activities and reflect them in our balance sheet at their fair values 
however  changes in the fair value of our cash flow hedges are generally recognized in our income statement when the hedge is settled 
the determination of fair value for our hedging derivatives requires substantial judgment 
the fair values of our derivatives are based upon certain estimations and internal valuation techniques 
these estimations use various factors that include closing exchange prices on the nymex  over the counter quotations  correlation of the hedged items to the hedging instruments and basis location differences 
the factors underlying our estimates of fair value and our assessment of correlation of our hedging derivatives are impacted by market volatility and changes 
recent accounting pronouncements in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended 
this statement amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments and for hedging activities under sfas no 
in general  sfas no 
was effective for the company on a prospective basis for contracts entered into or modified after june   and for hedging relationships designated after that date 
the adoption of sfas no 
had no impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
requires that certain financial instruments previously classified as equity be classified as liabilities or  in some cases  as assets 
the adoption of sfas no 
had no impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
 which it revised in december collectively  fin 
fin requires the consolidation of certain variable interest entities  as defined 
fin is effective for the company as of december   as it relates to special purpose entities  as defined  and in the first quarter for all other types of variable interest entities 
however  disclosures are required currently if a company expects to consolidate any variable interest entities 
we do not have investments in any variable interest entities  and therefore  the adoption of fin did not have an impact on our financial statements and is not expected to have an impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk includes the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
we face market risk from commodity price variations and also incur  to a lesser extent  credit risks and risks related to interest rate variations 
commodity price risk through our consolidated subsidiary  markwest energy partners  lp  we are engaged in the gathering  processing and transmission of natural gas  the transportation  fractionation and storage of ngls and the gathering and transportation of crude oil 
we also market natural gas and ngl products 
our products are commodities that are subject to price risk resulting from material changes in response to fluctuations in supply and demand  general economic conditions and other market conditions  such as weather patterns  over which we have no control 
our primary risk management objective is to reduce volatility in our cash flows 
our hedging approach uses a statistical method that analyzes momentum and average pricing over time  and various fundamental data such as industry inventories  industry production  demand and weather 
a committee  which includes members of senior management  oversees all of our hedging activity 
we utilize a combination of fixed price forward contracts  fixed for float price swaps and options on the over the counter otc market 
new york mercantile exchange nymex traded futures are authorized for use 
swaps and futures allow us to protect our margins because corresponding losses or gains in the value of financial instruments are generally offset by gains or losses in the physical market 
we enter otc swaps with financial institutions and other energy company counterparties 
we use standardized swap agreements that allow for the offset of positive and negative exposures 
net credit exposure is marked to market daily 
we are subject to margin deposit requirements under otc agreements and nymex positions 
the use of financial instruments may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances  including instances when i ngls do not trade at historical levels relative to crude oil  ii sales volumes are less than expected requiring market purchases to meet commitments  or iii our otc counterparties fail to purchase or deliver the contracted quantities of natural gas  ngls or crude oil or otherwise fail to perform 
to the extent that we engage in hedging activities  we may be prevented from realizing the benefits of favorable price changes in the physical market 
however  we are similarly insulated against unfavorable changes in such prices 
in addition to these risk management tools  we utilize our ngl product storage facilities and contracts for third party storage to build product inventories during lower demand periods for resale during higher demand periods 
types of price risk within our ngl marketing segment  our price risk varies by contract as well as by spot market prices for both ngl and natural gas commodities 
our appalachian producers compensate us for providing midstream services under one of two contract types under keep whole contracts  we take title to and sell the ngls produced in our processing operations 
we also reimburse or keep whole the producers for the btu content of the ngls removed through the re delivery to the producers of an equivalent amount on a btu basis of dry natural gas 
keep whole contracts therefore expose us to ngl product price risk on the sales side and natural gas price risk on the purchase or reimbursement side 
under percent of proceeds contracts  we take title to the ngls produced in our processing operations  sell the ngls to third parties and pay the producer a specified percentage of the proceeds received from the sales 
percent of proceeds contracts therefore expose us to ngl product price risk 
all of our michigan processing business is also governed by percent of proceeds contracts 
basis risk we are also subject to basis risk  which is the risk that an adverse change in the hedging market will not be completely offset by an equal and opposite change in the price of the physical commodity being hedged 
basis risk is primarily due to geographic price differentials between our physical sales locations and the hedging contract delivery location 
while we are able to hedge our basis risk for natural gas commodity transactions in the readily available natural gas financial marketplace  similar markets do not exist for hedging basis risk on ngl products 
ngl product basis risk also results from the difference in relative price movements between crude oil and ngl products 
we may use crude oil  instead of ngl products  in our hedges because the ngl hedge products and markets are limited 
crude oil is typically highly correlated with certain ngl products 
we hedge our ngl product sales by selling forward propane or crude oil 
commodity risk management position as of december   we have hedged ngls and natural gas sales as follows year ending december  markwest hydrocarbon  inc ngl volumes hedged using crude oil ngl gallons  ngl sales price per gallon na markwest energy partners  lp hedged natural gas sales natural gas mmbtu   natural gas sales price per mmbtu natural gas puts natural gas mmbtu  natural gas sales price per mmbtu na total hedged natural gas natural gas mmbtu   natural gas sales price per mmbtu all projected margins or prices on open positions assume a the basis differentials between our sales location and the hedging contract s specified location  and b the correlation between crude oil and ngl products  are consistent with historical averages 
as of december   we are not a party to any basis risk hedges 
credit risk counterparties  pursuant to the terms of their contractual obligations  expose us to potential losses as a result of nonperformance 
we maintain credit policies with regard to our counterparties that we believe minimize overall credit risk 
such policies include the evaluation of a prospective counterparty s financial condition  collateral requirements where deemed necessary  and the use of standardized agreements  which facilitate the netting of cash flows associated with a single counterparty 
we also monitor the financial condition of existing counterparties on an ongoing basis 
in general  our risk of default by these counterparties is low 
however  we experienced a loss in as described below 
sfas no 
provides that hedge accounting must be discontinued on contracts when it becomes reasonably possible that the counterparty will default 
during the fourth quarter of  enron corporation and its subsidiaries enron filed for bankruptcy protection 
in response to this filing  we terminated all derivative contracts where enron was the counterparty 
as a result  in we wrote off million of risk management assets related to our cash flow hedges offset by million of risk management liabilities related to our fair value hedges 
in addition  our contracts with enron provided for netting of amounts owed to each other and as such we netted million in amounts payable to enron 
the net result of the above transactions was a charge of million to earnings in the fourth quarter of in the case of discontinued hedge accounting for cash flow hedges  sfas no 
provides the amount in other comprehensive income will be reclassified to earnings in the periods of the forecasted transactions 
as such  we reclassified and million from other comprehensive income to revenue  net of million and million of deferred taxes for and  respectively 
while we enter into derivative transactions principally with investment grade counterparties and actively monitor their credit ratings  it is nevertheless possible that additional losses will result from counterparty credit risk in the future 
interest rate risk through our consolidated subsidiary  markwest energy partners  lp  we are exposed to changes in interest rates  primarily as a result of our long term debt with floating interest rates 
markwest energy partners may make use of interest rate swap agreements during the term of the partnership s credit facility that matures on november   to adjust the ratio of fixed and floating rates in the debt portfolio 
as of december   the partnership is a party to contracts to fix interest rates on million of debt at through may  compared to floating libor  plus an applicable margin 
sensitivities our annual sensitivities to changes in commodity prices considering our hedge position are as follows markwest hydrocarbon  inc for every per mmbtu increase in the natural gas price  our gross margin would decrease by million  and for every per gallon reduction in ngl prices  our gross margin would decrease by million 
markwest energy partners  lp for every per mmbtu increase in the natural gas price  the partnership s gross margin  exclusive of the arapaho processing plant  would increase by million  and for every per gallon reduction in ngl prices  exclusive of the arapaho processing plant  the partnership s gross margin would decrease by million 
the partnership s arapaho plant processing margins are sensitive to commodity price changes 
because of the nature of the contracts associated with the plant  gross margin increases as the price of ngls increases relative to natural gas and gross margin decreases as the price of natural gas increases relative to the price of ngls 
in the latter case  however  the partnership has the option of not operating the plant in a low processing margin environment since the btu content of the inlet natural gas meets the btu specification of the interstate line into which the natural gas is delivered 
a per mcf change in the processing margin results in a million change in gross margin
