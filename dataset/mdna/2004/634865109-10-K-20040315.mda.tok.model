item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in thousands  except per share data 
the purpose of this discussion is to provide information about the financial condition and results of operations of national bankshares  inc and its wholly owned subsidiaries and other information included in this report 
this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of the company s actual results could differ materially form those set forth in the forward looking statements 
critical accounting policies general the company s financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
the financial information contained within our statements is  to a significant extent  financial information that is based on measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred 
a variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained when earning income  recognizing an expense  recovering an asset or relieving a liability 
the company uses historical loss factors as one factor in determining the inherent loss that may be present in the loan portfolio 
actual losses could differ significantly from one previously acceptable method to another method 
although the economics of the company s transactions would be the same  the timing of events that would impact the transactions could change 
allowance for the loan losses the allowance for loan losses is an estimate of the losses that may be sustained in our loan portfolio 
the allowance is based on two basic principles of accounting i sfas  accounting for contingencies  which requires that losses be accrued when they are probable of occurring and are estimable and ii sfas  accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  which requires that losses be accrued based on the differences between the value of collateral  present value of future cash flows or values that are observable in the secondary market and the loan balance 
our allowance for loan losses has three basic components the formula allowance  the specific allowance and the unallocated allowance 
each of these components is determined based upon estimates that can and do change when the actual events occur 
the formula allowance uses a historical loss view as an indicator of future losses and  as a result  could differ from the loss incurred in the future 
however  since this history is updated with the most recent loss information  the errors that might otherwise occur are mitigated 
the specific allowance uses various techniques to arrive at an estimate of loss 
historical loss information  expected cash flows and fair market value of collateral are used to estimate these losses 
the use of these values is inherently subjective  and our actual losses could be greater or less than the estimates 
the unallocated allowance captures losses that are attributable to various economic events  industry or geographic sectors whose impact on the portfolio have occurred but have yet to be recognized either in the formula or in the specific allowance 
core deposit intangibles effective january   the company adopted financial accounting standards board statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
accordingly  goodwill is no longer subject to amortization over its estimated useful life  but is subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test 
additionally  statement requires that acquired intangible assets such as core deposit intangibles be separately recognized if the benefit of the asset can be sold  transferred  licensed  rented  or exchanged  and amortized over its estimated useful life 
branch acquisition transactions were outside the scope of the statement and therefore any intangible asset arising from such transactions remained subject to amortization over their estimated useful life 
in october  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
 acquisitions of certain financial institutions 
the statement amends previous interpretive guidance on the application of the purchase method of accounting to acquisitions of financial institutions  and requires the application of statement no 
 business combinations  and statement no 
to branch acquisitions if such transactions meet the definition of a business combination 
the provisions of the statement do not apply to transactions between two or more mutual enterprises 
in addition  the statement amends statement no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets  to include in its scope core deposit intangibles of financial institutions 
accordingly  such intangibles are subject to a recoverability test based on undiscounted cash flows  and to the impairment recognition and measurement provisions required for other long lived assets held and used 
the company has determined that the acquisitions that generated the intangible assets and goodwill on the consolidated balance sheets in the amount of  and  at december  and  respectively  did not constitute the acquisition of a business  and therefore will continue to be amortized 
overview national bankshares  inc nbi is a financial holding company located in southwest virginia 
it conducts operations primarily through two full service banking affiliates  the national bank of blacksburg and bank of tazewell county 
it also has one nonbanking affiliate  national bankshares financial services  inc  which offers investment and insurance products 
revenues and net income derived from the nonbanking affiliate are not significant at this time  nor are they expected to be significant in the foreseeable future 
management characterizes nbi as a community bank operation 
performance summary the following table shows nbi s key performance ratios for the period ended december  and return on average assets return on average equity basic net earnings per share fully diluted net earnings per share net interest margin noninterest margin net interest margin year to date tax equivalent net interest income divided by year to date average earning assets 
noninterest margin noninterest income excluding securities gain and losses less noninterest expense excluding the provision for bad debts and income taxes divided by average year to date assets 
the company has shown improvement in all of its key ratios when and are compared 
future performance is dependent on the general state of the local and national economy 
economic conditions dictate interest rate levels and loan growth  both of which directly impact the company s performance 
an increase in interest rates  as is predicted in late by some economists and financial commentators  would at least temporarily have an adverse affect on the net interest margin 
see the discussion in net interest income below 
growth the following table shows nbi s key growth indicators for the period ending securities   loans net   deposits   total assets   with the exception of loans  all categories show growth 
the largest decrease in loan totals was in the category of loans to individuals  which declined  in april nbi  through its btc subsidiary  expects to complete an acquisition of certain loans and deposits from another financial institution 
this is expected to add approximately million in loans and approximately million in deposits 
nbi s nbb subsidiary has entered into an agreement to acquire substantially all of the assets and assume substantially all of the liabilities of another national bank 
the transaction is subject to regulatory approval and it is expected to close in the first half of it is anticipated to add approximately in deposits and approximately million in total assets 
asset quality key asset quality indicators are shown below nonperforming loans loans past due over days other real estate owned  allowance for loan losses to loans net charge off ratio 

other real estate owned has increased substantially 
based on current information it is expected that this category will increase in  before it will begin to decline 
for further information see the discussion under provision and allowances for loan losses 
net interest income vs net interest income for was  an increase of  over during interest income decreased  as assets repriced downward 
interest bearing liabilities repriced downward at a faster pace  causing a decline in interest expense 
the net result of these events was a slight increase in the net interest margin to from in the current trend is the result of an unusually long period of low interest rates 
based on currently available data  management believes that interest rates will rise as the economy continues to recover 
such increases could occur as early as the third or fourth quarter of rising rates would at least have a temporarily negative effect on the net interest margin 
the ultimate effect would depend on the exact timing  amount and number of rate increases experienced 
for additional information see the comments under derivatives and market risk exposures 
the investment portfolio  in particular  would be affected by an interest rate increase  as many of the company s investments are long term 
in a rising rate environment it might become impractical to sell available for sale securities 
substantial additions to the held to maturity category over the past few years also tends to make the company s balance sheet less responsive to interest rate fluctuations 
finally  call features of certain bonds held in both the available for sale and held to maturity portfolios would be less likely to be activated in a rising rate environment 
vs net interest income for was  an increase of  or over this increase was primarily the result of the low interest rate environment the company experienced throughout all of the yield on earning assets for was  declining basis points during the year 
during the same period  the cost to fund earning assets decreased by basis points 
these combined to produce an increase in the net interest margin of basis points 
the cost to fund earning assets declined at a faster rate than the yield on earning assets 
while the current rate environment continues to be generally favorable to the company s overall profitability  it is the opinion of management that current rate levels are not sustainable over a long period of time 
it is believed that  as the general economy recovers  interest rates can be expected to increase to negate or control inflationary pressures 
rising interest rates generally have a short to intermediate term adverse effect on the company s net interest income and profitability 
in the meantime  while interest rates remain at low levels  it is expected that the company s yield on earning assets will gradually decline as older  higher rate loans and investments mature or are called 
in particular  longer term investments purchased during the period to replace those matured or called may ultimately have a negative impact on net interest income 
as indicated by the statement of cash flows  approximately  in securities available for sale were purchased in these securities consisted predominately of securities with maturities in excess of five years 
in purchasing these securities  the company has increased the level of interest rate risk in its balance sheet 
while the securities have been classified as available for sale  a future rising rate environment and the accompanying decrease in asset value could make the sale of the securities undesirable from a profitability perspective 
in addition  with callable securities purchased during a period of low interest rate levels  the expectation of the call feature being activated is somewhat diminished 
hence  in a rising rate scenario the company s ability to reprice these assets could be limited and result in a negative impact on the company s net interest margin 
analysis of net interest earnings the following table shows the major categories of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the interest earned or paid  the average yield or rate on the daily average balance outstanding  net interest income and net yield on average interest earning assets for the years indicated

nonaccrual loans are included in average balances for yield computations 
analysis of changes in interest income and interest expense the company s primary source of revenue is net interest income  which is the difference between the interest and fees earned on loans and investments and the interest paid on deposits and other funds 
the company s net interest income is affected by changes in the amount and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and by changes in yields earned on interest earning assets and rates paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the following table sets forth  for the years indicated  a summary of the changes in interest income and interest expense resulting from changes in average asset and liability balances volume and changes in average interest rates rate

interest rate sensitivity vs the company considers interest rate risk to be a significant market risk and has systems in place to measure the exposure of net interest income and fair market values to movement in interest rates 
interest rate sensitivity analyses provides management with information related to repricing opportunities  while interest rate shock simulations indicate potential economic loss due to future interest rate changes 
during the overall interest rate environment remained at a historically low level 
while interest rates are expected to remain low for the first half of  in the opinion of management rate increases are an inevitable consequence of the ongoing economic recovery 
any increase in interest rates would have  at a minimum  a temporarily negative impact on performance 
risk factors and forward looking statements previously discussed under net interest income apply 
as previously stated  the company uses simulation analysis to forecast its balance sheet and monitor interest rate sensitivity 
one test is a shock analysis that measures the effect of a hypothetical  immediate and parallel shift in interest rates 
the following table shows the results of a rate shock and the effects on net income and return on average assets and return on average equity projected at december  for purposes of this analysis noninterest income and expenses are assumed to be flat 
in thousands  except for percent data rate shift bp change in net income return on average equity return on average assets simulation analysis allows the company to test asset and liability management strategies under rising and falling rate conditions 
as a part of the simulation process  certain estimates and assumptions must be made 
these include  but are not limited to  asset growth  the mix of assets and liabilities  rate environment and local and national economic conditions 
asset growth and the mix of assets can  to a degree  be influenced by management 
other areas  such as the rate environment and economic factors  cannot be controlled 
for this reason actual results may vary materially from any particular forecast or shock analysis 
this shortcoming is offset somewhat by the periodic reforecasting of the balance sheet to reflect current trends and economic conditions 
shock analysis must also be updated periodically as a part of the asset and liability management process 
vs during and  interest rates rose substantially 
in addition to the adverse effects on the net interest margin  the rising rates reduced the company s ability to respond to interest rate movements 
at december   the company s investment portfolio contained a substantial amount of longer term securities with call features 
due to the higher interest rate levels  the securities were not called as anticipated 
at the time  the net unrealized losses made the sale of the securities impractical  thereby restricting one of management s primary means of controlling the effects of interest rate changes 
with the onset of the declining rate environment that began in january  both of the aforementioned problems began to abate 
interest expense  which had been at high levels at the beginning of  declined rapidly and market values of the securities rebounded making the sale of the securities feasible  if deemed necessary 
during  the company continued to benefit from the low interest rate environment 
while this favorable interest rate level is expected to continue into  it is not within management s ability to predict the timing or extent of any future interest rate increases 
noninterest income vs noninterest income for was  an increase from service charges on deposits increased by the increase was the result of changes in the terms of certain demand deposit products and the associated service charges 
service charges in are expected to increase  as the changes in service charge structure were not in effect for all of volume increases due to acquisitions are expected 
see the discussion under acquisitions 
credit card fees were up over due to volume increases in merchant and interchange fees 
future increases will also be volume related 
trust income increased by when compared to trust income is dependent market conditions as well as the type of account being handled at any given point in time 
in market conditions improved  resulting in additional fees 
the number of estates handled also increased 
net securities gains and losses were down from in the second and third quarter of the company sold certain investments owned by the parent company for a total gain of approximately there were no similar sales in vs noninterest income for was  an increase of or 
the largest increase occurred in realized gains and losses on securities and other income categories 
non recurring income described below accounted for much of the increase 
the level of service charges on deposits is driven by demand deposit volume  types of accounts opened  service charge rates in effect  the level of charges such as overdraft fees  and the fee waiver policy for these fees 
service charges on deposit accounts were  for  a decrease of or from there were no unusual factors that had a material impact on this category in trust income for was  a decrease of or from trust income is dependent upon market conditions as well as the types of accounts being handled at any given point in time 
market conditions  which directly affect the value of trust assets managed and in turn trust fees  were less favorable in credit card income is composed of several types of fees and charges  including transaction or interchange fees  merchant discount fees  and over limit charges 
given the highly competitive market  which limits the amount of set charges  revenue increases result from growth in the number of merchant accounts processed and increases in the number of customer credit and debit card accounts 
credit card income for was  an increase of or when compared to  primarily due to increased volume 
a portion of this increase was due to reduced charges from the company s credit card processor 
these charges are tiered and  having reached the next higher volume level  the charges decreased accordingly 
increased income in this area was also in part due to volume created by the addition of new merchants 
other income for the year ended december  was  an increase of or 
for other income contained several nonrecurring items 
included in this was nontaxable proceeds from a life insurance policy  which was approximately and a legal expense recovery of from a prior year 
other income also includes commissions from the sale of securities and insurance  which totaled approximately in and in net realized gains and losses on securities was  an increase of over in the second and third quarter of  the company sold investments at a total gain of approximately the remainder of the net increase was due to called securities and routine equity adjustments on certain investments 
noninterest expense vs noninterest expense for was  an increase of  or over the most significant changes occurred in the salaries and employee benefits  credit card processing expenses and other operating expenses categories 
salaries and employee benefits increased by or of that increase  approximately was due to increased pension expense 
during a period of low interest rates  rates used in actual forecasts are lower and result in higher net periodic pension expense 
when interest rates rise  the amount of expense decreases 
the remainder of the increase is due to normally expected increases in salaries and benefits 
credit card processing increased over as previously mentioned in noninterest income above  credit card income increased because of a greater volume of merchant income 
credit card merchant expense moves in tandem with merchant income 
other operating expenses were up or 
a major portion of this increase is in additional virginia bank franchise tax which was incurred because of an increases in bank capital resulting from earnings 
also included is in repossession expense and related to a loss on the sale of a closed branch facility 
overall  noninterest expense is expected to increase due to planned acquisitions in the first half of see the discussion under acquisitions 
vs noninterest expense for was  an increase of or from the largest increase was in the salaries and employee benefits category  which increased or 
net costs of other real estate owned increased to or 
these items are described in further detail below 
salaries and employee benefits  as previously mentioned increased at a rate higher than average for the company for several reasons 
in the first quarter of  the company s btc affiliate acquired a branch office in bluefield  virginia 
salaries and employee benefits expense for this office were included for nine months in  as opposed to twelve months for for the first time since it became a participating employer in the national bankshares  inc employee stock ownership plan  the company s btc affiliate had a contribution expense of to the esop in employee health insurance  executive compensation and other benefits also experienced increases 
data processing expenses decreased by or when and are compared 
this decline was due to a reduction in maintenance costs and the absence of conversion costs associated with a branch acquisition 
in the company was advised by its host computer hardware provider that operating system support would be terminated by the end of given the importance of this area  management initiated a project to determine the appropriate course of action 
management elected to upgrade its host computer system 
credit card processing expenses were up for an increase in volume offset by two nonrecurring items totaling combined to produce the increase 
of the two nonrecurring items  one represented a refund of certain processing charges 
the second  for  consisted of contract signing incentives connected with acquiring a new vendor 
expenses related to other real estate owned were for the primary cause of this increase was a write down of certain properties 
these properties had been held for a period of more than ten years 
while several sales had taken place over the past few years  they could best be characterized as somewhat slow 
this effort  which was designed to accelerate sales of the properties  was in large part successful 
income taxes vs income tax expense for increased by when compared to in the company became subject to the marginal tax rate because of higher income 
this new rate resulted in a credit to tax expense of approximately tax exempt income continues to be the primary difference between the expected and reported tax expense 
the company s effective tax rates for  and were  and  respectively 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information relating to income taxes 
vs income tax expense increased in due to the increase in net income and was offset to a degree by a higher level of investment in tax free obligations 
tax exempt interest income continues to be the primary difference between the expected and reported income tax expense 
effects of inflation the company s consolidated statements of income generally reflect the effects of inflation 
since interest rates  loan demand  and deposit levels are related to inflation  the resulting changes are included in net income 
the most significant item which does not reflect the effects of inflation is depreciation expense 
historical dollar values used to determine depreciation expense do not reflect the effects of inflation on the market value of depreciable assets after their acquisition 
provision and allowance for loan losses vs the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is based on management s judgment and analysis of current and historical loss experience  risk characteristics of the loan portfolio  concentrations of credit and asset quality  as well as other internal and external factors  such as general economic conditions 
an internal credit review department performs pre credit analyses of large credits and also conducts credit review activities that provide management with an early warning of asset quality deterioration 
the internal credit review department also prepares regular analyses of the adequacy of the provision for loans losses 
these analyses include calculations based upon a mathematical formula that considers identified potential losses and makes pool allocations for historical losses for various loan types 
in addition  an amount is allocated based upon such factors as changing trends in the loan mix  the effects of changes in business conditions  the effects of any changes in loan policies  and the effects of competition and regulatory factors on the loan portfolio 
the internal credit review department has determined that the company s provision for loan losses is sufficient 
during the company s btc affiliate experienced a decline in asset quality 
the result to date has been an increase in foreclosed properties  as shown by the following table 
the problem has been recognized by management 
efforts specifically designed to focus on problem loans and to work intensively with delinquent borrowers have been undertaken 
when these efforts are unsuccessful  management is moving more quickly to liquidate loan collateral and to institute legal collection activities 
as the issues are resolved  it is expected that the number of foreclosed properties will increase  before it eventually declines 
to date the net charge off rate has remained stable 
loan past due ninety days or more were at december   slightly lower than the at december   and the at december  vs several factors contributed to the company s decision to increase the provision for loan losses in while overall asset quality remained satisfactory in  the level of exposure to loss increased  particularly in the loans to individuals category 
in addition  much of the growth in was in the commercial loan category  which increased the company s exposure to losses resulting from defaults in large dollar loans 
while the number of such defaults would only constitute a small number of loans  the sizable dollar amount of the individual credits tends to increase the possibility of greater loss 
declining economic conditions in the company s market area have also contributed to a higher net charge off ratio which rose from 
in to 
in and 
in in addition  total nonperforming assets were at on december   an increase of from iv 
summary of loan loss experience a

growth was from development of the existing franchise  as there were no acquisitions in in the fourth quarter of the company agreed to acquire the loans and deposits of one branch office of another bank 
the acquisition is expected be completed in the first half of  increasing loans by approximately million and deposits by million 
no fixed assets are to be acquired 
in early  the company agreed to a second acquisition of assets including fixed assets and assumption of liabilities which is planned to be completed in the first half of this transaction is expected to add approximately million in deposits and million in total assets 
vs total assets for the company at december  were  this represents an increase of  or when compared to total daily average assets were  for  which compares to  for growth for was from the development of the company s existing franchise  as there were no acquisitions in loans vs loans net of unearned income decreased by  or 
in real estate construction and real mortgage loans both showed increases of approximately million  however this was offset by a slight decline in commercial loans and a million decline in loans to individuals 
management believes the decline in loans to individuals is due to several reasons 
o general economic conditions and the lack of employment opportunity in portions of the company s market area 
o a decline in consumer requests for new car financing because of special financing incentives offered by automobile companies 
o consumers use of credit cards with higher credit limits 
o consumers taking advantage of low mortgage rates to refinance home mortgages to obtain funds that might otherwise have been borrowed through a consumer loan 
reversal of this trend may occur to some extent as economic conditions change and higher interest rates make mortgage refinancing less appealing 
however  management believes that automotive related financing offers and competition from the credit card sector will remain 
since loans to individuals are generally higher yielding  this trend will not have a favorable effect on net interest income 
vs loans net of unearned income and deferred fees grew by  or during as can be seen by the balance sheet  the composition of the loan portfolio shifted toward the commercial category during loans to individuals have experienced a moderate decline 
securities vs securities in the available for sale portfolio increased  when december  and are compared 
securities held to maturity increased  when the same comparison is made 
in order to maximize yields  securities are generally purchased with long term maturities 
many have call features 
as set out in the statement of cash flows  the company sold one bond classified as held to maturity because of credit quality concerns 
the company liquidated its remaining investments in that issue in the first quarter of it should be noted that over the past three years the company has purchased approximately million in securities classified as held to maturity 
when the volume of securities purchased is considered  there have been few credit quality concerns in the investment portfolio 
credit quality will continue to be monitored and any necessary adjustments initiated to ensure that credit quality remains high and that it meets regulatory standards 
vs securities available for sale at december  were  an increase of  or over securities held to maturity totaled  at december  these securities decreased by  or from the totals at december  as can be seen in the consolidated statement of cash flows   was reinvested in securities available for sale and  in securities held to maturity

deposits vs total deposits grew by  or in all categories reflected increases except time deposits  which declined by 
in the interest bearing deposit categories the largest dollar growth was in interest bearing demand deposits  which grew by  this was followed by saving deposits  which grew by  the decline in time deposits is a continuation of the trend of customers being unwilling to choose longer term deposit instruments 
this trend is expected to reverse when interest rates move to higher levels  which will provide an incentive for customers to invest for longer periods 
vs total deposits at december  were  an increase of  or from december  noninterest bearing demand deposits grew by  while interest bearing demand deposits grew by 
savings deposits increased by  with time deposits declining by 
management believes that the increase in interest bearing demand deposits is in part due to customers expectations of higher interest rates in the near to intermediate term  which created a reluctance to commit to longer term deposit instruments

in addition  the company has investments in non mortgage backed structured notes with fair value of approximately  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information relating to securities 
the company s securities and loans are subject to credit and interest rate risk  and its deposits are subject to interest rate risk 
management considers credit risk when a loan is granted and monitors credit risk after the loan is granted 
the company maintains an allowance for loan losses to absorb losses in the collection of its loans 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for information relating to the allowance for loan losses 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for information relating to concentrations of credit risk 
the company has an asset liability program to manage its interest rate risk 
this program provides management with information related to the rate sensitivity of certain assets and liabilities and the effect of changing rates on profitability and capital accounts 
the effects of changing interest rates are primarily managed through adjustments to the loan portfolio and deposit base  to the extent competitive factors allow 
the investment portfolio is generally longer term 
adjustments for asset and liability management concerns are addressed when securities are called or mature and funds subsequently reinvested 
historically  sales of securities have occurred for reasons related to credit quality or regulatory limitations 
few  if any  securities available for sale have been disposed of for the express purpose of managing interest rate risk 
no trading activity for this purpose is planned for the foreseeable future  though it does remain an option 
while this planning process is designed to protect the company over the long term  it does not provide near term protection from interest rate shocks  as interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities do not  by their nature  move up or down in tandem in response to changes in the overall rate environment 
the company s profitability in the near term may be temporarily affected either positively by a falling interest rate scenario or negatively by a period of rising rates
