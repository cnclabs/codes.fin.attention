we produce a suite of products and services  in partnership with leading enterprise technology companies  delivered through a global distribution network in more than countries 
these products address the fax server  network fax  production fax  e document delivery  enterprise fax  business process automation workflow and mobile business markets  and are primarily distributed through independent distributors and value added resellers 
our products run on off the shelf server hardware  windows nt  windows  microsoft 
net and interface with a wide variety of telephony and computer equipment 
our rightfax product line includes rightfax and rightfax enterprise  our local area network lan based fax server lines for windows based operating systems  and the rightfax production system  a high volume production oriented server that enables fax and other forms of electronic transmission for electronic commerce applications 
these products automate the receipt and delivery of messages  data and documents within an organization and to and from customers  vendors and others outside the organization 
according to published reports  we believe the fax and electronic documents market is approximately million worldwide at wholesale 
our rightfax product offering consists of software that we develop and a fax board provided by a manufacturer 
we are reselling fax boards made by brooktrout  inc and work closely with them to integrate technology development and minimize order intervals 
we sell rightfax with fax boards from other manufacturers such as intel dialogic  and we can use boards from either of these domestic manufacturers 
based on our revenue forecasts  we buy and hold inventory at our headquarters in bellevue  washington  and we closely monitor inventory turns and investment 
with minor exceptions  all rightfax products are shipped from our bellevue location 
we have software from third parties included in our rightfax software and we pay royalties to these companies 
the software from other companies provides generic or non strategic functionality and we have determined it was appropriate to license this software 
our total royalty expense was of revenue in we have an extensive services offering that is sold in conjunction with our rightfax products  which includes maintenance  support  professional services and solutions 
all of these offerings are designed to help customers protect and extend their software investment 
the processing of unstructured information such as messages  data and documents  typically creates business process challenges in an organization 
our business process automation product  teamplate  is a fully microsoft 
net compliant workflow product that automates many intra departmental  inter departmental and inter company processes with thorough rules logic and an intuitive interface 
the market we are addressing is business process automation and based on published reports  we believe this market is approximately billion to billion worldwide 
the suite of products includes teamplate 
net full license  teamplate enterprise  teamplate solutions and teamplate wizards for popular microsoft office  sharepoint  exchange and cms software 
in the teamplate products  no hardware is included and we do not license any third party software 
we are amortizing the capitalized cost of the teamplate technology  and that amortized cost of approximately  per quarter is included in cost of revenue 

table of contents the mobility oriented products  acquired from infinite technologies infinite in  add a key competitive differentiator to our document delivery and business process automation products by allowing customers to use our products to receive and access information from a wide variety of web enabled devices 
we sell our products primarily through an indirect channel of resellers and distributors 
we also sell through our enterprise sales force  and strategic partnerships  original equipment manufacturers oem and private label agreements 
we believe the use of multiple distribution channels that access many of the same potential customers increases the likelihood that our products will be sold to a particular customer 
we work with approximately  resellers and distributors  located throughout the world 
these resellers and distributors sell and install our products  and they receive discounts primarily depending on the volume of sales achieved 
within our sales and marketing groups we dedicate significant energies monitoring  generating demand  providing market positioning and support for our resellers and distributors 
utilizing the indirect channel approach provides several advantages  including minimizing the investment in offices and personnel in field locations  and applying greater resources to sales and implementation efforts 
with a channel sales model  it is more difficult to track end user information and we have incomplete information on the number and locations of all end users utilizing our products 
the vast majority of product implementations are performed by our channel partners 
however  in some instances customers want high level installation and consulting services directly from us 
we measure this part of our business on a margin basis and we expect to expand our professional services group as we identify additional service opportunities 
in early  we purchased officecom bv officecom  our former distributor in the netherlands  and in october  we purchased certain distribution rights from axient pty limited axient  our former distributor in australia and established our own distribution subsidiary in australia 
these acquisitions provide an operating and service base in our key international markets 
the majority of our sales are made through the indirect channel and we expect our resellers and distributors will continue to provide the majority of sales 
in early  we concluded our resources were spread across too many product lines and markets  and in mid  we narrowed our focus to enterprise business information delivery solutions 
we divested medialinq  our outsource e document services division on september  although this business unit was profitable  we were not satisfied with the sales and marketing synergy between the rightfax and medialinq products 
we sold the medialinq division for million in cash to xpedite systems  inc xpedite  a division of ptek  inc concurrent with the sale transaction  we also entered into license and reseller agreements with xpedite  under which we will license our fax to mail technology to xpedite in return for minimum compensation of million over a three year period 
for segment reporting purposes  medialinq s operations were previously reported in the e document services segment 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  medialinq s results of operations  net of income taxes  have been reclassified to discontinued operations 
we also sold the callxpress voice mail and unified messaging product line on september  we experienced declining callxpress sales reflective of the depressed market for most telephony products  and the callxpress product had a significantly lower margin than rightfax 
we announced our intent to sell the callxpress product line in july this announcement caused a further decline in callxpress revenue as prospects delayed buying decisions 
coincident with the sale  we incurred restructuring costs of  primarily associated with terminating employees not retained by the buyer 
we sold the callxpress product line for million to applied voice and speech technologies  inc avst 
we have the opportunity to receive further payments of million per year for each of the next three years depending on avst s success in achieving certain revenue targets 
since callxpress was a product line and many activities were shared with the rightfax product line  the callxpress product line results  including the gain on disposition  are included in our results from continuing operations 
at the same time as our decision to divest the callxpress product line  we began negotiating an acceleration and conclusion of our oem agreement with cisco systems  inc cisco 
in october  we reached agreement with cisco and accordingly  cisco paid us million in the fourth quarter of of that total  million is reflected in license revenue  and the remaining  is for training and technical support which we will recognize as we provide these services in or when the commitment period expires 

table of contents we acquired teamplate  inc teamplate on september  to expand our business information delivery product offerings as an extension and complement to our existing rightfax product offering  and to further penetrate the business process automation market 
in the fourth quarter of  we rapidly integrated teamplate into the existing operations of the company by combining functional organizations and centralizing the back office support 
we place significant importance on retaining the teamplate senior management team and executed an earn out agreement with a minimum payment of million over the quarters following the acquisition provided that all the participants remain employed at captaris 
we expect teamplate revenue will grow faster than rightfax revenue 
we expect to sell the teamplate products both separately and with our rightfax and infinite products 
in the near term  we expect most teamplate revenue will come through existing relationships in the microsoft partners channel and from our enterprise sales group 
over time  we expect an increasing percentage of teamplate revenue will come from teamplate products sold into our existing customer base and by our distributors and resellers as they become more familiar with the teamplate products 
critical accounting policies we believe you must take into account certain of our accounting policies to fully understand our results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
note that our preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
the securities and exchange commission has defined a company s most critical accounting policies as the policies that are the most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates used  including those related to the valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets  useful lives of intangible assets and equipment and leasehold improvements  inventory valuation allowances  revenue recognition  and the estimated allowances for sales returns and doubtful accounts 
we base our estimates on historical experience  current conditions  and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
our estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources  as well as identifying and assessing our accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions  judgments or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies involve the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we also follow other key accounting policies  which involve the use of estimates  judgments  and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k 
our most critical accounting policies relate to the following areas revenue recognition  allowances for sales returns and doubtful accounts  valuation of inventory at lower of cost or market value  valuation of acquired businesses  assets and liabilities  valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill  useful lives of intangible assets  equipment and leasehold improvements  and contingencies revenue recognition 
our revenue recognition policies follow the guidelines of the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop no 
 software revenue recognition  as amended 
these guidelines require that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the selling price is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured before revenue can be recognized 
we sell products through resellers  original equipment manufacturers oems  and other channel partners  as well as directly to end users 
we recognize product revenue upon shipment  net of estimated returns  provided that collection is determined to be probable and no significant obligations remain 
all software licenses are bundled with days of telephone 
table of contents support 
revenue associated with this telephone support is not significant 
therefore we do not defer any revenue related to this telephone support  and we accrue the cost of providing this telephone support at the time the revenue is recognized 
whenever a software license  hardware  installation and post contract customer support or pcs elements are combined into a package with a single bundled price  a portion of the sales price is allocated to each element of the bundled elements based on their respective fair values as determined when the individual elements are sold separately 
revenue from the license of software is recognized when the software has been shipped and the customer is obligated to pay for the software 
revenue for pcs is recognized on a straight line basis over the service contract term  generally one to five years 
pcs includes rights to unspecified upgrades and updates  when and if available  and bug fixes 
installation revenue is recognized when the product has been installed at the customer s site and accepted by the customer 
recognition of revenue from software sold with installation services is recognized either when the software is shipped or when the installation services are completed  depending on our agreement with the customer and whether the installation services are integral to the functionality of the software 
consulting services are customarily billed at fixed rates  plus out of pocket expenses  and revenues are recognized when the consulting has been completed 
however  if it is determined that a consulting engagement will be unprofitable  we recognize the loss at that time 
training revenue is recognized when the training is completed 
in general  customers are granted a day right of return for product sales 
we accrue estimated product returns 
when rights of return are present and we cannot estimate returns  we recognize revenue when customer acceptance occurs 
costs related to insignificant customer support obligations  which include telephone support  are accrued at the time the related revenue is recognized 
prior to our sale of the medialinq division  we recognized revenue from document delivery services when services were provided 
revenue related to our oem agreement with cisco systems  inc cisco was recognized when cash payments were received and all services had been performed 
allowance for sales return 
we must make estimates of potential future product returns related to current period revenue 
we analyze historical returns  current economic trends  changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products when evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns in any accounting period 
it is possible that these estimates will change in the future or that the actual amounts could vary from our estimates and result in reductions to recognized revenue 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we must estimate the uncollectibility of our accounts receivable 
we analyze historical bad debts  the aging of customer accounts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment patterns when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our bad debt expenses for any period  if we made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
valuation of inventory at lower of cost or market value 
due to rapid changes in technology  it is possible that older products in inventory may become obsolete or that we may sell these products below cost 
when we determine that the carrying value of inventories is not recoverable  we write down inventories to market value 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than we project  inventory write downs may be required  and this may have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
valuation of acquired businesses  assets  and liabilities 
our business acquisitions typically result in recording goodwill and other intangible assets  which may affect the amount of future period amortization expense and impairment charges that we will incur 
the determination of the fair value of such intangible assets and goodwill is a critical and complex consideration that involves significant assumptions and estimates 
these assumptions and estimates are based on our best judgments and could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations 
impairment of goodwill 
we assess impairment at least annually for goodwill  or when indicators of impairment exist 
we perform our annual assessment during the first quarter of our fiscal year 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators include our assessment of the impacts of legal factors  market and economic conditions  the results of our operational performance  and strategic plans  competition and market share  and any potential for the sale or disposal of a significant portion of our principal operations 
if we conclude that indicators of impairment exist  we then assess the fair value of goodwill 
the valuation process provides an estimate of a fair value of goodwill using a discounted cash flow model and includes many assumptions and estimates 
once the valuation is determined  we will write down goodwill to its determined fair value  if necessary 
any write down could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
impairment of equipment and leasehold improvements  long lived assets and other intangible assets 
we periodically review long lived assets  other intangibles and product lines that we are more likely than not to sell or otherwise dispose of before the end of the asset s previously estimated useful life for impairment 
we assess the impairment of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
our judgments regarding the existence of 
table of contents impairment indicators are based on legal factors  market conditions and operational performance of our long lived assets  other intangibles and reporting segments 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that certain assets are impaired resulting in a material write down of assets to the then determined fair value 
when we determine that indicators of impairment exist  we then assess the fair value of these assets 
the valuation process provides an estimate of a fair value of these assets using a discounted cash flow model and includes many assumptions and estimates 
once the valuation is determined  we will write down these assets to their determined fair value 
any write down could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
useful lives of equipment  leasehold improvements and intangible assets 
equipment and leasehold improvements  identifiable intangible assets and certain other long lived assets are amortized over their useful lives 
useful lives for equipment and leasehold improvements are based on our estimates of the period that the equipment or leasehold improvement will be used 
useful lives for intangible assets are based on our estimates of the period that the intangible assets will generate revenue 
changes in useful lives could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
contingencies 
we are periodically involved in litigation or claims  including patent infringement claims  in the normal course of our business 
we follow the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  to record litigation or claim related expenses 
we evaluate  among other factors  the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss 
we accrue for settlements when the outcome is probable and the amount or range of the settlement can be reasonably estimated 
in addition to our judgments and use of estimates  there are inherent uncertainties surrounding litigation and claims that could result in actual settlement amounts that differ materially from estimates 
we expense our legal costs associated with these matters at the time incurred 
consolidated results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of net revenue represented by certain items in our consolidated statements of operations 
year ended december  net revenue cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative amortization of intangible assets impairment of intangible assets in process research and development restructuring charges stock compensation expense benefit gain on sale of callxpress product line patent settlement with audiofax total operating expenses operating income loss other income  net income loss from continuing operations before income tax expense benefit income tax expense benefit income loss from continuing operations income from discontinued operations income loss before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle cumulative effect of change in accounting principle net income loss 
table of contents net revenue we derive net revenue primarily from licensing software as well as follow on sales of add on software modules and the sale of maintenance and support agreements 
we continue to distribute fax boards with a significant number of our software product sales for which we receive a margin significantly less than the margin on our software products 
percent change from percent change from in thousands net revenue rightfax product line cisco oem agreement callxpress product line teamplate product line net revenue years ended december  and the million increase in net revenue in compared to is primarily attributable to increased revenue from the rightfax product line  additional revenue from acceleration of an oem agreement with cisco and revenue from the teamplate product line  which we acquired on september  the increase in revenue was partially offset by divesting the callxpress product line on september  the decline in callxpress revenue for the first nine months of compared to was primarily due to challenging competitive conditions and the announcement in july of our intent to sell the callxpress product line 
excluding revenue from the callxpress product line and revenue from the oem agreement with cisco  net revenue for increased or million from this increase is primarily attributable to increased demand for our rightfax products 
revenue growth from the rightfax product line was much stronger in the second half of which we believe reflects the benefit of narrowing our sales and marketing focus to business information delivery 
international revenue from the rightfax product line represented of total net revenue for compared to for the increase in revenue from our international regions is due to our continued investment and expansion into international markets 
in august  we acquired our long time distributor in the netherlands and in october  we acquired certain distribution rights from axient pty limited in australia 
during  we received a full twelve months of revenue from our operations in the netherlands and two months of revenue from our operations in australia compared to receiving only five months of revenue from our netherlands operations in teamplate  our business process automation product line contributed net revenue of  during the fourth quarter of we anticipate that revenue from the rightfax product line will grow at approximately the same percentage in and teamplate product lines will grow more rapidly than the rightfax product line 
historically  our business experiences seasonality with a sequential decline in revenue during the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter of the prior year  and our fourth quarter revenue tends to be the largest quarter for revenue during the year 
we anticipate this pattern again in in october  we reached an agreement with cisco to accelerate the conclusion of our oem agreement announced in january pursuant to the agreement  cisco agreed to pay us million as payment in full of all remaining unpaid aggregate license fees 
in return  we agreed to provide a maximum of hours of support and training services for a period not to exceed twelve months 
as a result of this agreement  we recognized revenue of million in  compared to revenue of million in we deferred the recognition of approximately  of the million payment related to support and training services 
this revenue will be recognized as we provide support and training services over the next nine months 
years ended december  and the million increase in net revenue in compared to is primarily attributable to increased revenue from the rightfax product line and revenue from an oem agreement with cisco consummated in january  offset by lower revenue from the callxpress and mobile business solutions products 
excluding revenue from the callxpress product line and million in revenue from the oem agreement with cisco  net revenue for increased or million from this increase is primarily attributable to our rightfax product line  offset by a  decrease in revenue from mobile business solutions products 
revenue from the rightfax product line was million in  an increase of from the increase in rightfax revenue in was driven by an increase in maintenance revenue as we continued to expand our installed base of customers  partially offset by a decrease in sales of software and distributed circuit boards 
the decrease in revenue from mobile business solutions products was due to uncertainty in this emerging market and switching our focus of this product line from a stand alone product line to one sold exclusively as an add on to our rightfax products 

table of contents gross profit gross profit is calculated as the selling price of our products  net of estimated returns  less cost of revenue 
cost of revenue includes manufacturing and distribution costs for products and programs sold  royalties for licensed products  amortization of acquired technology  product warranty costs  operation costs related to product support and costs associated with the delivery of professional services 
percent change from percent change from in thousands gross profit percentage of revenue years ended december  and the increase in gross profit for compared to is primarily attributable to an million increase in revenue from the oem agreement with cisco in compared to  as noted above 
realization of revenue from the cisco oem agreement has a material impact on our gross profit  as cost of revenue related to this agreement is insignificant 
in addition to the contribution from the oem agreement with cisco  exiting the lower margin callxpress product line in september and a higher rightfax sales volume also contributed to the increase in gross profit 
excluding gross profit from the cisco oem agreement  gross profit increased to million in from million in as a percentage of revenue  gross profit was in  compared to in due to a higher sales volume from the rightfax product line in conjunction with less sales volume from the lower margin callxpress product line 
this increase in gross profit percentage was offset by amortization of technology intangibles related to the teamplate product line included in cost of revenue and an increase in the percent of revenue attributable to hardware products which are sold at significantly lower gross profit margins than software products 
we anticipate that future gross profit  as a percentage of revenue  will be consistent with  excluding the impact of the cisco oem agreement and the callxpress product line 
years ended december  and in  gross profit increased compared to however  the gross profit as a percentage of revenue was negatively impacted by write downs of inventory that resulted from excess inventory brought on by earlier than expected adoption of newer voice and fax board versions 
excluding gross profit from the oem agreement with cisco  gross profit decreased to million in from million in as a percentage of revenue  gross profit decreased to in compared to in  primarily due to the inventory write downs noted above 
in  we also recognized  in severance expense in cost of revenue related to a voluntary layoff program announced in october research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits and related expenses for developers  product managers  quality assurance personnel and payments to outside contractors for programming services 
percent change from percent change from in thousands research and development percentage of revenue years ended december  and the decrease in research and development expenses in compared to is due to a decrease in staffing costs as a result of having fewer employees in compared to in addition  the research and development expenses for included a reversal of a performance incentive arrangement of approximately  we expect research and development expenses to increase in as we invest further in the combined rightfax and teamplate product line 
however  as a percentage of revenue  we expect research and development expenses to be consistent with years ended december  and the decrease in research and development expenses in compared to is due to our efforts to control costs and reduce investment in our mobile business solutions offerings and the reversal of a  charge related to the settlement of an accrual in associated with an earn out provision from the infinite technologies acquisition 
in  it became apparent that the mobile business solutions market was not developing at the pace originally anticipated 
accordingly  we reduced our spending in this area 
in  we recognized  in severance expense in research and development related to a voluntary layoff program announced in october 
table of contents selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits and related expenses for sales  marketing  business development  customer service  finance  administrative and information technology personnel  as well as advertising and marketing expenses 
in addition  selling  general and administrative expenses include legal  accounting and other professional fees 
percent change from percent change from in thousands selling  general and administrative percentage of revenue years ended december  and the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses in compared to is primarily attributable to lower staffing costs resulting from a reduction in our workforce during and  offset by severance expenses in and further offset by additional incentive compensation awards related to the increase in revenue in compared to approximately  of severance expense was incurred in in connection with the termination of several former management level employees 
we expect selling  general and administrative expenses to decrease in absolute dollars as well as a percentage of revenue in compared to as a december fiscal year end company  we expect to incur significant costs to comply with the sarbanes oxley act of for  we estimate the cost of this compliance to be in the range of  to  for third party consultants in addition to significant internal costs 
years ended december  and significant additional selling  general and administrative costs were incurred in as a result of the launch of our mobile business solutions initiative  significant corporate branding efforts and additional headcount resulting from the acquisition of infinite technologies 
the reduction in reflects our initiative to control costs driven primarily by a significant reduction in headcount 
in  we recognized  of severance expense in selling  general and administrative related to a voluntary layoff program announced in october amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets is a result of the acquisitions of teamplate and infinite technologies  in addition to amortization expense associated with two nonexclusive license agreements with syntellect and audiofax 
amortization expense for the license agreements and core technology is recorded in cost of revenue and was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
amortization expense recorded in operating expenses was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
based on the current amount of intangible assets subject to amortization  we estimate amortization expense for the next five years as follows million for and million in each of the years through  and  for see additional discussion of amortization expense in patent settlement with audiofax  discussed below 
impairment of intangible assets on january   we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
prescribes one accounting model for long lived assets and requires these assets to be measured at the lower of book value or fair value 
in the second quarter of  we engaged an independent valuation firm to provide an estimated fair value of each of our intangible long lived assets using a discounted cash flow model 
the determination of fair value is a critical and complex consideration when assessing impairment under sfas no 
that involves significant assumptions and estimates 
these assumptions and estimates were based on our best judgments 
as a result  we determined that certain intangible assets acquired from infinite technologies in january were impaired 
accordingly  we recorded an impairment charge of million for the mobile delivery reporting unit in the second quarter of this impairment charge consisted of a write down of core technology of approximately million  a write down of customer base and marketing channel of approximately million and a write down of tradename of approximately 
table of contents in process research and development in the first quarter of  we recorded a charge of million for acquired in process research and development related to the acquisition of infinite technologies 
restructuring charges in september  in conjunction with the sale of our callxpress product line  we recorded a restructure charge of approximately  for severance and related benefits for terminated employees associated with callxpress 
all costs associated with this restructuring were paid as of december  in january  we announced a reduction of our workforce  affecting approximately employees  or of the total company workforce 
this reduction in force resulted in the recognition of a restructuring charge recorded in continuing operations of million related to severance  impairment of certain assets and non cancelable lease obligations  and a restructuring charge recorded in discontinued operations of  related to severance 
all costs associated with this reduction in force were paid as of december  during the first quarter of  we recorded a restructuring charge of million related primarily to the consolidation of our tucson  arizona and kirkland  washington operations  which amount was fully paid by december  stock compensation expense benefit during the second quarter of  we offered a limited non compulsory exchange of employee stock options on a less than one for one basis 
the exchange which closed on july  resulted in the voluntary cancellation of employee stock options to purchase  shares of our common stock with varying exercise prices greater than per share in exchange for  employee stock options with an exercise price of 
the option exchange offer resulted in variable accounting treatment for a total of  options  representing the  new options granted in the exchange as well as all employee options modified during the year 
variable accounting treatment will result in charges or credits recorded to stock based compensation  depending on fluctuations in quoted prices for our common stock and the number of stock options subject to variable accounting  neither of which can be predicted 
at december   and  we had   and  options to purchase common stock subject to variable accounting 
in  we recorded a total charge for stock compensation expense of million consisting of a charge to continuing operations of million and a charge to discontinued operations of  in  we recorded a total benefit for stock compensation expense of million  consisting of a benefit to continuing operations of  and a benefit to discontinued operations of  in  we recorded a total charge for stock compensation expense of million  consisting of a charge to continuing operations of million and a charge to discontinued operations of  we expect to record stock compensation charges or benefits in future quarters for the options outstanding subject to variable accounting 
the amount of these charges or benefits will depend on our stock price and the number of stock options subject to variable accounting that are outstanding during each quarter  neither of which can be predicted 
these charges or benefits could have a material impact on our reported financial results in a particular quarter or for the year 
gain on sale of the callxpress product line on september   we sold our callxpress product line 
we recognized a gain on the sale of callxpress of approximately million before taxes in the year ended december  see note to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents patent settlement with audiofax in april  we entered into a nonexclusive license agreement with audiofax ip llc  settling a patent infringement suit filed by audiofax on november  we paid a one time fee to license the technology until the patents expire in and in the first quarter of  we recorded a charge of  reflecting our assessment of the fair value of the portion of the license fee that related to prior years 
we capitalized the balance of the license fee  and it is being amortized over the remaining life of the licensor s patents 
amortization expense related to this license was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  and is recorded in cost of revenue 
other income  net other income  net  consists primarily of investment income and foreign currency transaction gains and losses 
for the years ended december   and  other income decreased from million in to million in and to in the decline in other income reflects the decrease in interest rates on invested funds for each of these periods 
assuming interest rates remain at recent levels  we expect interest income to further decline  as rates on maturing investments are greater than rates currently available 
income tax expense benefit the effective income tax rates on income and losses from continuing operations in  and were  and  respectively 
we recognized income tax expense on income from continuing operations of million in and an income tax benefit on loss from continuing operations of million in and million in our effective income tax rate is based on a combination of our estimated combined statutory federal and state income tax rates 
our effective tax rate increased in and primarily due to no longer amortizing nondeductible goodwill as a result of our adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  in january further  the effective tax benefit in was reduced by the in process research and development expense in which was not deductible for tax purposes 
we anticipate the effective tax rate for to be generally consistent with the effective tax rate for see note to the consolidated financial statements 
discontinued operations on september   we completed the sale of our medialinq division 
as such  medialinq s results of operations have been reclassified as discontinued operations 
we also recognized a gain of approximately million  net of income taxes of million  which is reported as gain on sale under discontinued operations 
under the terms of the agreement  captaris received million in cash 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in january  in accordance with the adoption of sfas no 
 we engaged an independent valuation firm to assist us in assessing the fair value of goodwill recorded on our books as of january  the valuation process provided a fair value of goodwill using a discounted cash flow model that also considered factors such as market capitalization and estimated values of certain assets 
the determination of fair value is a critical and complex consideration when assessing impairment under sfas no 
that involves significant assumptions and estimates 
these assumptions and estimates were based on our best judgments  and we recorded a transitional impairment charge in the first quarter of for a portion of the goodwill in our mobile business solutions reporting unit 
this transitional impairment charge was approximately million  and the effect of adopting sfas no

severance payments of  in january k employer matching contribution of  in february we provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products 
we evaluate estimated losses for such indemnifications under sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  as interpreted by financial accounting standards board interpretation fin no 
we consider such factors as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of the loss 
to date  we have not encountered material costs as a result of such obligations and have not accrued any liabilities related to such indemnifications in our financial statements 
we periodically receive letters and other communications from third parties asserting patent rights and requesting royalty payments  and will probably receive additional claims in the future 
for example  over the past six years  we have been involved in intermittent communications with avaya  which was spun off from lucent technologies in over this period of time  lucent avaya asserted that we were infringing on their patents or technology  eventually identifying patents as including claims that allegedly cover our current or former products and or services 
several communications and meetings between us and lucent avaya have occurred

analysis of both patents in light of our current and former products services is still underway 
the last communication with representatives of bellsouth was on june  the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot presently be determined

certain of the disclosure requirements prescribed by fin no 
r apply in all financial statements issued after january   regardless of when the variable interest entity was established

in november  the eitf published its consensus on eitf no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  each of which could adversely affect the value of the company s investments 
the company does not currently use derivative financial instruments 
interest rate risk the company maintains an investment portfolio consisting primarily of investment grade interest bearing securities 
these securities are classified as available for sale securities 
the interest bearing securities in our portfolio are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
a decrease of in the average interest rate would have resulted in a decrease of approximately  in our interest income for investment risk if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels at december   the decline in the fair value of the portfolio would not be material 
because the company has the ability to hold its fixed income investments until maturity  it does not expect its operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by a sudden change in market interest rates on its securities portfolio 
cash available for reinvestment  however  may be invested in lower interest rate securities 
foreign currency risk currently  substantially all of our revenue is denominated in us dollars 
we price our international sales to the united kingdom in uk pounds sterling  to canada in canadian dollars  to australia in australian dollars  and to participating european community countries in euros 
increases in the value of the dollar against any local currencies could cause our products to become relatively more expensive to customers in a particular country or region  leading to reduced revenue or profitability in that country or region 
as we continue to expand our international operations  we expect our non us dollar denominated revenue and our exposure to gains and losses on international currency transactions to increase 
we do not currently engage in transactions to hedge against the risk of currency fluctuations  but we may do so in the future 
in addition  we are exposed to foreign currency translation fluctuations associated with our assets and liabilities denominated in australian dollars  canadian dollars  the euro and united kingdom pounds sterling 
the objective in managing these foreign currency translation exposures is to minimize the risk through minimizing the level of activity and financial instruments denominated in those currencies 
our foreign currency financial instruments primarily consist of cash  trade receivables  trade payables  accrued expenses and intercompany loans 
for an entity with various financial instruments denominated in a foreign currency in a net asset position  an increase in the exchange rate would result in less net assets when converted to us dollars 
conversely  for an entity with various financial instruments denominated in a foreign currency in a net liability position  a decrease in the exchange rate would result in more net liabilities when converted to us dollars 
historically  we have not hedged our translation risks on these currencies 
we have the ability to hold our foreign currency denominated assets indefinitely and do not expect that a sudden or significant change in foreign exchange rates would have a material impact on future net income or cash flows
