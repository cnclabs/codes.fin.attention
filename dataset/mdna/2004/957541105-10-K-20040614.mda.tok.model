item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the following discussion should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this form k 
all references herein to the term fiscal year shall mean a year ended march of the year specified 
the company commenced operations in as a provider of telecommunications network transmission products that enable advanced telecommunications services over copper telephone wires 
until fiscal  the company derived substantially all of its revenues from its network service access nsa product lines  particularly the sale of network interface unit niu products and related products 
niu products accounted for approximately  and of revenues in fiscal years  and  respectively 
the company introduced its first dsl products in fiscal and these products accounted for approximately  and of revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
niu products and dsl products are the two major products within the company s telecom equipment business 
telecom equipment constituted approximately  and of revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
the company has also provided audio teleconferencing services since fiscal  which constituted approximately  and of revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
the company has two reportable segments 
these segments are strategic business units that are managed separately because each business requires different technologies and market strategies 
they consist of a telecommunications equipment manufacturer of local loop access products  which include broadband consumer network equipment cne products and network service access nsa products 
nsa products are primarily network interface unit niu products and cne products are primarily dsl products  and a multi point telecommunications service bureau operated through the company s subsidiary conference plus  inc conference plus  inc 
specializes in audio teleconferencing  multi point video conferencing  broadcast fax and multimedia teleconference services 
below is a table that compares annual revenue from the company s two reportable segments and the two main equipment product groups 
fiscal of fiscal of fiscal of revenue revenue revenue cne equipment    nsa equipment    total equipment segment    services segment    total revenue    the company reached profitability and positive cash flow from operations for the first time as a public company in fiscal in fiscal  the company improved its profitability primarily due to gains achieved from volume efficiencies  productivity improvements and favorable component pricing in the cne product line of the equipment segment of the business 
the company continues to experience pricing pressures in both product segments 
the transition to higher speed digital transmission services continued to negatively impact the nsa product line of the equipment segment 
the company expects revenue and earnings per share in the quarters ending june  and september  to be lower than the revenue and earnings per share recorded in the quarter ended march  the company believes this expected reduction in revenue and earnings per share is the result of entering into a long term pricing agreement  increased coordination with the customer to lower the customer s inventory levels  and seasonally in the equipment segment of the business 
the company anticipates that revenues should begin to increase again in the third fiscal quarter 
the company s customer base is comprised primarily of the regional bell operating companies rbocs  independent domestic local exchange carriers and public telephone administrations located outside the us due to the stringent quality specifications of its customers and the regulated environment in which its customers operate  the company must undergo lengthy approval and procurement processes prior to selling its products 
accordingly  the company must make significant upfront investments in product and market development prior to actual commencement of sales of new products 
in addition  to remain competitive  the company must continue to invest in new product development and invest in targeted sales and marketing efforts to cover new product lines 
the company expects to continue to evaluate new product opportunities and engage in extensive research and development activities 
the company is focusing on expanding its product offerings in the equipment segment from basic high speed broadband to more sophisticated applications such as networking  wireless and managed services 
this will require the company to continue to invest in research and development and sales and marketing  which could adversely affect short term results of operations 
in view of the company s reliance on the dsl market for revenues and the unpredictability of orders and pricing pressures  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its financial results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
revenues from nsa products such as nius have declined in recent years as telephone companies continue to move to networks that deliver higher speed digital transmission services 
failure to increase revenues from new products  whether due to lack of market acceptance  competition  technological change or otherwise  would have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
critical accounting policies the company uses estimates and judgements in applying its accounting policies which have a significant impact on the results reported in the consolidated financial statements 
the following are the company s most critical accounting policies 
accounts receivable the company sells products primarily to various telecommunications providers and distributors 
sales to these customers have varying degrees of collection risk associated with them 
judgment is required in assessing the realization of these receivables based on aging  historical experience and customer s financial condition 
inventory reserves the company reviews ending inventory for excess quantities and obsolescence based on its best estimates of future demand  product lifecycle status and product development plans 
the company also evaluates ending inventory for lower of cost or market 
prices related to future inventory demand are compared to current and committed inventory values 
inventory purchase commitments in the normal course of business  the company enters into commitments for the purchase of inventory 
the commitments are at market rates and normally do not extend beyond one year 
should there be a dramatic decline in revenues  as there was in fiscal  the company may incur excess inventory and subsequent losses as a result of these commitments 
the company has established reserves for anticipated losses on such commitments 
valuation allowance for deferred tax assets the company has significant deferred tax assets that resulted primarily from historically generated net operating losses 
a valuation allowance has been provided for a portion of these deferred tax assets that management believes it is more likely than not that these assets will not be utilized 
the company accesses the realizability of deferred tax assets through an analysis of projected future taxable income 
estimates of future taxable income is comprised of a tax planning strategy and a three year estimate of future income that will be generated by operations less tax differences including expected stock option deductions 
goodwill and intangibles under new accounting rules  which became effective in fiscal  goodwill and other indefinite lived intangibles are no longer amortized but subject to annual impairment tests 
the company determined that it operated in two reporting units for the purpose of completing the impairment test of goodwill 
these reporting units are telecom equipment and telecom services 
the company utilizes the comparison of its market capitalization and third party appraisal of its telecom services reporting unit to book value as an indicator of potential impairment 
the company performed its annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal these tests showed no impairment of goodwill 
on an ongoing basis  the company reviews intangible assets and other long lived assets other than goodwill for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
if such events or changes in circumstances occur  the company will recognize an impairment loss if the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset are less than the carrying value of the related asset 
the impairment loss would adjust the asset to its fair value 
software development the company accounts for software development costs under fas  accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  other otherwise marketed 
the company reviews software development to determine when technological feasibility is reached 
at such time  development costs will be capitalized as intangible assets 
these intangible assets will be amortized over the product life once the product is available for customer use 
at of march   the company did not have any capitalized costs 
results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage of revenues represented by certain items in the company s statements of operations for the periods indicated fiscal year ended march  equipment services total revenues cost of equipment cost of services total cost of goods sold gross margin operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative goodwill and intangible amortization goodwill and intangible impairment restructuring charge total operating expenses operating income loss other income  net interest expense income loss before income taxes and minority interest income tax expense benefit minority interest net income loss fiscal years ended march   and revenues

the decrease in nsa revenue was offset by a million increase in cne revenue due primarily to an increase in unit volume offset in part by a decrease in average selling price 
service revenue decreased million or in fiscal compared to fiscal due to a reduction in call minutes resulting from the economic downturn and the loss of one major customer that resulted in a million revenue reduction 
this was offset in part by customers choosing to hold meetings using teleconference services instead of traveling because of war and health concerns around travelling to locations with outbreaks of communicable diseases and terrorist threats

the fiscal gross margin in the equipment segment was positively effected by million as the company was able to sell modem inventory which had been reserved as excess and obsolete based on the estimated technological life of the modems at march  the fiscal equipment gross margin was positively impacted by an  contractual settlement that had no corresponding cost of sales as well as reduced per unit material  labor  and handling costs  particularly in the cne product group that resulted from a increase in unit volume 
gross margin in the services segment was million  million and million and gross margin as a percentage of revenues was  and in fiscal  and  respectively

this benefit attributed in part to the reduction in services margin in fiscal year  which was also negatively impacted by a million reduction in revenue 
services margin improved in fiscal year due to increased revenue of million and lower long distance rates  offset in part by a  charge for the early termination of a purchase contract  which was recorded in the december quarter 
the company believes continued pricing pressures and continued reduction of nsa sales affecting its equipment segment could continue to adversely impact margins in the future

quarterly cne revenues in fiscal grew due to increased unit sales of dsl products offset in part by lower sales prices per unit 
nsa revenues decreased in fiscal and fiscal due primarily to the recession in the telecommunications industry 
conference plus service revenues decreased in first two quarters of fiscal due to the slowing economy and the loss of one large customer 
service revenue increased in the final two quarters of fiscal and fiscal due to increased call minutes 
the increase in teleconferencing minutes was due in part to customers choosing to hold meetings using teleconference services instead of traveling because of war and health concerns around traveling to locations with outbreaks of communicable diseases and terrorist threats 
gross margin as a percentage of revenue has varied from quarter to quarter 
the september  equipment segment gross margin was positively effected by million as the company was able to sell modem inventory that was reserved as excess and obsolete based on the estimated technological life of the modems at march  the june  equipment gross margin included a one time product royalty of million 
the september  equipment gross margin included a million expense to settle a customer contract obligation 
the december  service gross margin was negatively impacted by a  charge recorded as a result of an early contract termination penalty of a long distance contract 
the improvement in equipment segment gross margin in fiscal and was primarily due to reduced per unit material  labor  handling costs and overhead costs in the cne products resulting from increased unit sales offset in part by decreased revenue per unit 
the march equipment margin was also positively impacted by the  contract settlement that had no corresponding cost of sales 
the company believes continued pricing pressures affecting its equipment segment could adversely impact sales prices and margins in the future 
it is the company s strategy to offset the effects of these anticipated price reductions with continued cost reductions and efficiencies within manufacturing 
operating expenses increased in the fiscal quarters compared to fiscal primarily due to increased spending in sales and marketing and to a lesser extent increased spending in engineering 
as a percentage of revenue  operating expenses increased in the last three quarters of fiscal due to goodwill impairment and restructuring charges taken during the quarters 
during fiscal  quarterly operating expenses remained relatively flat except for the fourth quarter  which was impacted by the company recording a million bonus for selected employees and profit sharing contribution expense for all employees offset by a  reduction in warranty reserves in its equipment segment 
the company expects to continue to experience significant fluctuations in quarterly results of operations 
the company believes that fluctuations in quarterly results may cause the market price of the class a common stock to fluctuate  perhaps substantially 
factors which have had an influence on and may continue to influence the company s results of operations in a particular quarter include the size and timing of customer orders and subsequent shipments  customer order deferrals in anticipation of new products  timing of product introductions or enhancements by the company or its competitors  market acceptance of new products  technological changes in the telecommunications industry  competitive pricing pressures  accuracy of customer forecasts of end user demand  write offs for obsolete inventory  changes in the company s operating expenses  personnel changes  foreign currency fluctuations  changes in the mix of products sold  quality control of products sold  disruption in sources of supply  regulatory changes  capital spending  delays of payments by customers  working capital deficits and general economic conditions 
sales to the company s customers typically involve long approval and procurement cycles and can involve large purchase commitments 
accordingly  cancellation or deferral of one or a small number of orders could cause significant fluctuations in the company s quarterly results of operations 
as a result  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
because the company generally ships products within a short period after receipt of an order  the company typically does not have a material backlog of unfilled orders  and revenues in any quarter are substantially dependent on orders booked in that quarter 
the company s expense levels are based in large part on anticipated future revenues and are relatively fixed in the short term 
therefore  the company may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected shortfall of orders 
accordingly  any significant shortfall of demand in relation to the company s expectations or any material delay of customer orders would have an almost immediate adverse impact on the company s business and results of operations and profitability 
liquidity and capital resources at march   the company had million in cash and cash equivalents consisting primarily of federal government agency instruments and the highest rated grade corporate commercial paper 
at march   the company had nothing outstanding and million available under its secured revolving credit facility

the amount available under the revolving credit facility at march  was million 
borrowings under this facility provide for the interest to be paid by the company at the prime rate or libor rate plus 
this credit facility contains covenants regarding ebitda  tangible net worth and maximum capital expenditures 
the company was in compliance with these covenants on march  and expects to comply with these covenants for the term of the debt 
on may   the company signed two subordinated promissory notes with solectron technology sdn bhd 
one note in the amount of million is for the payment of inventory held by solectron that the company was committed to buy 
the second note in the amount of million is for the payment of accounts payable and accrued interest 
both notes require a weekly principal and monthly interest payment and are payable over years 
the notes bear interest at the prime rate plus

the company expects to have this debt paid off by june  in connection with the company s management changes implemented at its subsidiary conference plus  inc  in fiscal year  the company purchased of the outstanding shares of common stock of conference plus  inc from former officers of conference plus  inc for approximately million 
the purchase price was based upon the minority interest value set forth in the annual appraisal of conference plus  inc that was completed by an independent financial advisor 
as of march   there was  outstanding under these notes 
the company s operating activities used cash of million in fiscal and generated cash of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
cash used by operations in fiscal resulted primarily from net losses and reductions in accounts payable in the equipment segment offset in part by net income in the services segment  non cash depreciation and amortization and decreased inventory in the equipment segment 
the decrease of inventory resulted from using inventory in fiscal that was on hand at the end of fiscal the decrease in accounts payable resulted from converting accounts payable to vendor debt in the equipment segment 
cash generated by operations in fiscal resulted primarily from net income  non cash depreciation and amortization in both segments and reductions in inventory offset in part by reductions in accounts payable in the equipment segment 
the inventory reductions were achieved by selling products throughout the year that were in inventory at march  cash generated by operations in fiscal resulted primarily from net income  non cash depreciation and amortization and tax benefit received from the exercise of employee stock options in both segments and was offset in part by the increase in deferred tax assets and inventories 
capital expenditures in fiscal  and were million  million and million  respectively 
in fiscal  million of capital expenditures were financed through leases 
the equipment segment capital expenditures in fiscal   and were million  million and million  respectively 
the capital expenditures in the equipment segment were primarily for machinery and research and development equipment purchases 
the services segment capital expenditures in fiscal  and were million  million and million  respectively 
these expenditures were primarily for teleconference bridge equipment 
at march  the company s principle sources of liquidity were million of cash and the secured revolving credit facility under which the company was eligible to borrow up to an additional million based upon receivables and inventory levels 
cash in excess of operating requirements  if any  will be used to pay down debt or invested on a short term basis in federal government agency instruments and the highest rated grade commercial paper 
the company believes its future cash requirements for the next twelve months will be satisfied by cash generated from operations and its current credit facility 
future obligations and commitments consisted of the following payments due by fiscal year in thousands thereafter total debt and capital leases   purchase obligations     future minimum lease payments for operating leases        future obligations and commitments        purchase obligations consist of raw materials in the equipment segment and local and long distance telephone service commitments in the service segment that arise in the normal course of business operations 
the company had net deferred tax assets of approximately million at march  the company has recorded a valuation allowance reserve of million to reduce the recorded net deferred tax asset to million 
the net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in realization of deferred tax assets associated with the company s future deductible temporary differences  net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income prior to their expiration 
the benefit for income taxes of million for fiscal year resulted from a current tax provision of million and a reduction of deferred tax assets of million offset by a reduction in the valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets in the amount of million 
the company reduced the valuation allowance in the fourth quarter of fiscal to reflect the million reduction in the deferred tax asset and to reflect management s belief  based in part on the company s return to profitable operations in fiscal and  that it is more likely than not an additional million of these deferred tax assets will be realized through the generation of future taxable income 
estimates of future taxable income are comprised of a tax planning strategy and a three year estimate of future income that will be generated by operations less tax differences including expected stock option deductions 
the tax planning strategy involves the potential sale of the company s subsidiary conference plus  inc the company based its estimate of the value of conference plus inc on the fiscal independent valuation updated for current future expected cash flows 
management periodically evaluates the recoverability of the deferred tax assets and will adjust the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets accordingly
