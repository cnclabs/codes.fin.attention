item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introductory overview american medical systems develops and delivers innovative medical solutions to our target patients and physicians 
since becoming an independent company in  we have worked to build a business that delivers consistent revenue and earnings growth  fueled by a robust pipeline of innovative products for significant  under penetrated markets of patients and their physicians 
we have greatly broadened our product line  building on our traditional base of products for erectile restoration and products for men s incontinence  stricture  and prostate disease which are used by urologists  to products for women s incontinence used by urologists and gynecologists  and  in  products for menorrhagia and other pelvic disorders used by gynecologists 
results of operations sales trends the following table compares net sales in thousands of our product lines between and  and between and increase increase product line dollars percent dollars percent men s health erectile restoration bladder control prostate treatment total women s health total men s health products 
during  revenue from erectile restoration products increased due to a continued shift to the inhibizone antibiotic coated penile implant introduced in  which carries a higher selling price than the non coated ams product to recover the cost of its drug eluting benefit 
erectile restoration unit volume declined by percent during the increase in erectile restoration sales reflects a continued shift to our inhibizone implants  which represent percent of our total erectile restoration volume  up from percent in the increase also reflects higher sales of our non inflatable implants  including the recently acquired dura ii product line 
these increases were partially offset by lower unit volume on our ambicor and non coated ams products resulting from our customer s preference for the inhibizone product 
overall unit volume increased approximately percent from to the increase in male bladder control sales was due to a combination of unit and price increases 
approximately one half of the increase in male bladder control revenues was due to price increases on both the ams 
table of contents artificial urinary sphincter and the invance male sling system  with the remaining increase from higher volumes on both products 
price and volume increases in both products resulted from product and procedure improvement 
prostate treatment sales continue to decline with unit volume of our urolume product  particularly in the us  as customers continue to prefer newer bph treatments 
women s health products 
revenue growth from women s health products was percent in and percent in with the market introduction and physician acceptance of our sparc and monarc sling systems for female stress urinary incontinence  partially offset by a decrease in infast unit sales as customers shifted over to our sparc product 
we believe that the less invasive nature of our sling procedures and the unprecedented number of surgical options we now have available for treating incontinence are encouraging more and more physicians to recommend our treatments 
international sales and foreign exchange effects 
during  revenues increased million as a result of favorable currency exchange rates  mainly the euro 
if currency exchange rates in were the same as in  total sales would have been million  an increase of million  or percent 
because a large share of our expenses associated with european sales are euro denominated costs  changes in these currency rates do not affect net income and cash flows from operations by the same dollar amount as they affect sales revenues

during  and continuing into  we experienced a significant decrease in warranty claims 
with further investigation  we concluded that these decreases were primarily the result of recent improvements in the quality and durability of our products and our claims processing procedures 
as a result  cost of goods sold in and reflect favorable reductions in our warranty allowance of million and million  respectively 
without these favorable adjustments  cost of goods sold during would have been million  or percent of sales  and million  or percent of sales for see critical accounting policies and estimates for further details on the warranty reversal 
excluding the effect of favorable currency exchange rates on revenue of million and the warranty reversal  cost of goods sold would have been percent of sales  a percentage point reduction from this decrease is due mainly to higher production volumes and product mix changes 
cost of goods sold as a percent of sales has generally benefited from relatively fixed overhead costs  which account for more than a quarter of our cost of goods sold  being spread over higher manufacturing volumes 
this benefit has been partially offset by a higher portion of our revenues coming from women s health products  which generally carry a slightly lower gross margin 
future cost of goods sold will continue to depend on production levels and product mix 
marketing and selling 
cost increases in resulted from higher employee and commission expenses to support higher sales and new product rollout costs 
a significant portion of this increase was to strengthen our international infrastructure  leading to increased international sales in and marketing and selling expenses increased further in as we expanded our work with gynecologists for her option by establishing a separate direct gynecology sales force  other women s health products  and erectile dysfunction patients 
increased spending for women s health products totaled million in we expect to continue these higher activity and spending levels going forward  although we expect them to decline as a share of sales as our sales increase 
in addition  we spent approximately million during to consolidate much of our european marketing and selling operations into a new shared service center in amsterdam 
we believe this new shared service center will allow us to grow our european business faster  more efficiently and with greater control 
we expect marketing and selling expense to be between and percent of sales going forward 

table of contents general and administrative 
cost increases in compared to were primarily due to professional fees and services  recruiting and relocation costs  and corporate insurance  partially offset by million in savings due to the closing of our influence facility in israel during major cost increases during were due to million of additional costs related to the cryogen operation  including the relocation of the san diego operation to minnesota in the fourth quarter of  million of additional product liability insurance expenses  and million of costs to support the extension of communication and information systems to our european offices 
we will incur additional expenses in to extend the capabilities of these systems to our other international offices 
the sarbanes oxley act passed in july has increased the focus on our financial reporting  public disclosure  and compliance practices  and expenses have increased for additional personnel and resources to comply with this act and related regulations 
we expect costs to continue to increase in future periods in order to comply with the legal and financial requirements of the sarbanes oxley act and related regulations 
research and development 
research and development includes costs to develop and improve current and possible future products plus the costs for regulatory and clinical activities for these products 
cost increases during in clinical studies and product development were more than offset by savings of million from the closing of our israeli research and development facility during cost increases during were primarily to support her option and other women s health products 
we expect total spending in research and development to increase further in  and in the longer term to continue to be in the range of to percent of net sales 
in addition  costs in this area could vary as a result of spending on purchased technologies 
amortization of intangibles 
the decreases in amortization in compared to are attributable to the company s adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  on december  under the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized 
the increase in amortization expense in compared to reflects the amortization of definite lived assets from the cryogen and dura ii acquisitions 
for a more complete description of this change and its impact on financial results see notes to consolidated financial statement no 
other income expense royalty income 
most of our royalty income is from the license of our stent delivery technology for medical use outside of urology 
this perpetual exclusive worldwide license was entered into during and is expected to continue to at least we receive a royalty equal to percent of net sales of licensed products on a quarterly basis  which accounted for million  million  and million in other income in   and interest income 
the increase in interest income was due to the full year investment of proceeds from our july secondary public offering  while reflects only one half year of interest income on these proceeds 
interest income was lower in than in due to lower cash balances as a result of the cryogen and dura ii acquisitions in  and lower interest rates 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased in as average borrowings declined by approximately million 
the decline during reflects a million decline in notes payable  as well as the expiration of our interest rate swap agreement on june  we had hedged a portion of our original million variable rate term loan  as required by our senior credit facility  by entering into an interest rate swap agreement in which we agreed to exchange  at specified intervals  the calculated difference between the fixed interest rate of the swap and the variable interest rate on a portion of our debt 
pre tax expense from this agreement was million during we did not renew the swap agreement and do not expect any swap related expenses going forward 
other 
on january   we terminated the ams retirement annuity plan 
at the time of this termination  we contributed approximately million to the pension plan and recorded a gain on pension plan termination of million 
we made this contribution to the pension plan to fully fund under funded pension plan liabilities that had accrued due to declining investment balances in the plan and low interest rates  and to fund early retirement benefits 
other expense for includes the write off of our million investment in collagenesis corporation see notes to consolidated financial statements 
the remainder of other income and expense includes exchange gains and losses resulting from the fluctuations in foreign currencies  mainly the euro  against the us dollar and relate to translating foreign denominated inter company receivables to current rates 

table of contents income tax expense as part of our adoption of statements of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we no longer record goodwill amortization that had been a permanent non deductible expense 
in  the total of this non deductible amortization was approximately million 
if the rules that we adopted in were in place in  the effective tax rate in would have been approximately percent 
our effective tax rate was approximately percent after taking into account the million we recognized with our application for certain us tax benefits related to research and development tax credits and extraterritorial income exclusion for the years through without the recognition of these credits  our tax rate would have been percent  down from percent in  reflecting our use of current period federal and state tax credits 
we expect our effective tax rate in to be in the range of percent to percent 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents were million as of january   compared to million as of december  this million decrease is primarily caused by debt repayments and the acquisition of cryogen and dura ii 
these decreases were partially offset by cash provided from operations totaling million 
cash flows from operating activities operating activities generated million  million  and million of positive cash flow in   and during  net income adjusted for the non cash expenses of depreciation and amortization resulted in a million current year increase and totaled million compared to million in and million in during  accounts payable and accrued expenses decreased million  primarily as a result of an additional million reduction in the allowance for warranty claims see critical accounting policies and estimates 
this compares to the million decrease in related to a million pension plan termination payment in addition to a million reduction in the allowance for warranty claims  and a million increase in resulting from a non cash expense of million due to the acceleration of stock option vesting for a former employee and a non cash expense of million related to the write off of an investment in collagenesis 
in addition  during the company increased inventories and accounts receivable by million and million to support business expansion  primarily in women s health 
deferred income tax assets increased by million in  mainly due to an assessment and resulting increase in the section net operating loss limitation 
cash flows for investing activities during  we invested million in injectx reported as a technology investment and spent million to acquire worldwide distribution rights for dermmatrix  a porcine dermis graft material used in sling and pelvic prolapse procedures reported as a purchase of intangibles 
we made additional million investments for each of these ventures during in addition  during we made milestone and contingent purchase price payments relating to the influence acquisition totaling million and a million investment in collagenesis corporation 
fixed asset additions during and were million and million  respectively 
during  we used million to acquire cryogen and dura ii  and million for capital expenditures 
cash flows from financing activities we have a senior credit facility consisting of term debt and a million revolving line of credit  which incurs a commitment fee of 
percent for unused portions 
the senior credit facility expires in september this facility is secured by substantially all of our assets  and contains certain restrictions requiring prior bank group approval 
the restrictions prohibit the payment of dividends and the incurrence of additional debt  limit capital expenditures to million for any fiscal year plus the unused portion of this million capital expenditure limit for the preceding fiscal year  limit acquisitions to an aggregate of million in any fiscal year  prohibit sale and leaseback agreements  and limit operating leases except for vehicles for sales personnel to million in any fiscal year 
in addition  we are subject to  and in full compliance with  four financial covenants a leverage ratio  an interest coverage ratio  a fixed charge coverage ratio  and a required minimum level of consolidated ebitda 
the following table sets forth these covenants and our compliance as of january  
table of contents credit facility covenant requirements company actual leverage ratio interest coverage ratio fixed charge coverage ratio minimum consolidated ebitda million million as of january   the outstanding principal balance under the term debt portion of the senior credit facility was million 
we did not have an outstanding balance under the revolving line of credit  so we have million of availability under that portion of the senior credit facility 
contractual obligations the following table sets forth the past payments and future commitments in thousands under the senior credit facility and operating leases 
less than more than total year years years years credit facility automobile leases office and facility rent total our credit facility consists of term debt and a revolving line of credit that expire in september payments shown include interest at the indexed rate at january  the automobiles are used by sales personnel 
the lease terms for automobiles are typically three years 
the office and facility rent includes the cryogen manufacturing facility in san diego and sales offices outside the us the lease for the cryogen facility expires on august  we have sublet the premises for the remaining lease term 
in  we acquired cryogen inc pursuant to the acquisition agreement  we will pay cryogen s former shareholders an earnout payment equal to three times our net revenues from sales of cryogen s products over a period of four consecutive quarters ending three years after closing  less million 
if our net product revenues attributable to sales of cryogen s products during any such four quarter period do not exceed million  no earnout payment will be made 
the maximum amount of the earnout payment is million 
the representative of the former cryogen shareholders has made a claim for a purchase price adjustment based on cryogen s net equity at the time of closing of the transaction 
we do not believe the former cryogen shareholders are entitled to a purchase price adjustment  and we do not believe that the resolution will be material to us 
this transaction is more fully described in our form k filed with sec on january  we believe that funds generated from operations  together with our balances in cash and cash equivalents and funds available under our senior credit facility  will be sufficient to finance current operations  planned capital expenditures  and commitments to cryogen shareholders for at least the next twelve months 
critical accounting policies and estimates we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is 
table of contents based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
at each balance sheet date  we evaluate our estimates  including but not limited to  those related to accounts receivable and sales return obligations  inventories  long lived assets  warranty  legal contingencies  and income taxes 
the critical accounting policies that are most important in fully understanding and evaluating the financial condition and results of operations are discussed below 
revenue recognition policy the company recognizes revenue when legal title to the goods passes to its customers 
approximately half of the company s revenue is generated from inventory loaned to customers or from consigned inventory maintained at hospitals or with field representatives 
in these situations  revenue is recognized at the time the product has been implanted or used 
the company reports sales net of estimated returns  rebates  and other trade discounts 
we have no post shipment obligations associated with our sales 
the shipment of product to distributors  which is less than five percent of our revenues  affects the timing of revenue recognition because the distributors take title fob our dock 
all of our customers have rights of return for the occasional ordering or shipping error 
we maintain an allowance for these returns and reduce reported revenue for expected returns from shipments during each reporting period 
allowance for doubtful accounts and other accounts receivable related valuation accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns that are calculated using subjective judgments and estimates to establish these valuation accounts 
different judgments could have material variances in the amount and timing of our reported results for any period 
in addition  actual results could be different from current estimates  possibly resulting in increased future charges to earnings 
an allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for all individual accounts receivable that we believe are unlikely to be collected 
for all other accounts receivable  an allowance for doubtful accounts based on the age of receivable balances is recorded 
at december  and january   the allowance for doubtful accounts was million 
the allowance was percent and percent of gross accounts receivable at the end of and  respectively 
we maintain an allowance for returns based on historical and current trends in product returns 
at december  this allowance was million  and increased to million at january   in connection with our product return policies for her option sales to gynecologists offices 
inventory valuation inventories are recorded at the lower of manufacturing cost or net realizable value 
each quarter  we evaluate our inventories for obsolescence and excess quantities 
this evaluation includes analyses of inventory levels  historical loss trends  expected product lives  sales levels by product  and projections of future sales demand 
we write off inventories we consider obsolete 
in addition  we record an allowance for inventory quantities in excess of forecasted demand 
inventory allowances were million and million at the end of and the reduction reflects enhanced inventory management practices 
if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than current estimates  additional inventory adjustments would be required and would adversely affect income in the period the adjustment is made 
warranty accrual allowance we warrant all of our products to be free from manufacturing defects 
in addition  if a product fails  we may provide replacements at no cost or a substantial discount from list price 
we maintain a warranty allowance to cover the cost of replacements for our erectile restoration  incontinence  and menorrhagia products 
when we sell products  we record an expense for the expected costs of future warranty related claims  and increase the warranty allowance by an equivalent amount 
we reduce the warranty allowance by the cost of the replacement device when an actual claim is awarded 
thus  the balance of the warranty allowance is an estimate of the future cost of honoring our warranty obligation 
factors influencing this estimate include historical claim rates  changes in product performance  
table of contents the frequency of use by the patient  the patient s performance expectations  and changes in the terms of our product replacement policy 
product reliability is a function of raw material properties  manufacturing processes  and surgical technique 
during  we noted a significant decrease in warranty claims 
with further investigation  we concluded that this decrease was the result of recent improvements in the quality and durability of our products and changes in our claims processing 
because we expected these trends to affect warranty claims for the foreseeable future  we determined that the warranty allowance should be reduced by approximately million 
in  the trend of lower claims experience continued  and further analysis indicated another adjustment of million to the accrued warranty allowance was appropriate 
these adjustments have been recorded as reductions to cost of goods sold and as increases in reported operating income and net income 
at january   our accrued warranty allowance was million compared to million at december  if we experience further changes in any of the factors that influence this estimate  we will make additional adjustments to this accrued warranty allowance 
legal liability accrual each quarter  we estimate the uninsured portion of legal representation and settlement costs of possible future product liability 
this evaluation consists of reviewing historical claims costs as well as assessing future trends in medical device liability cases 
social and political factors  as well as surgeon and medical facility responsibility  make litigation costs hard to predict 
accruals for future litigation costs were million at december   and increased to million on january  if  in the future  we determine that this accrual is inadequate  the adjustment would reduce reported income in the period we recorded the adjustment 
income taxes in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements  income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate are estimated 
this process involves estimating actual current tax exposures and assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we have significant amounts of deferred tax assets that are reviewed for recoverability and then valued accordingly 
we evaluate the realizable value of the deferred tax assets on a quarterly and yearly basis as well as an assessment for the need for valuation allowances by considering historical levels of income  estimates of future taxable income  and the impact of tax planning strategies 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets when we believe all or part of our deferred tax assets will not be realized 
a valuation allowance of million is maintained to offset tax loss carry forwards created in a foreign jurisdiction  which  if subsequently recognized  would be allocated to goodwill 
no other allowances against net deferred tax assets are maintained at january  if a determination is made that we would not realize all or part of the deferred tax assets  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance and a charge to income in the period of the determination would be made 
recent accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb fin 
fin requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
the company is required to apply fin to all new variable interest entities created or acquired after january  for variable interest entities created or acquired prior to february   management is required to apply fin  as amended  for periods ending after december  the company has determined that fin has no impact upon adoption 
in may  fasb issued sfas  accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas establishes standards for issuer classification and measurement of certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity  and is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may  instruments that fall within the scope of sfas must be classified as a liability 
for financial instruments issued prior to june   sfas is effective for the company in the second 
table of contents quarter of fiscal year adoption is not expected to have an impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp fas  accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of  which permits a sponsor of a postretirement health care plan that provides a prescription drug benefit to make a one time election to defer accounting for the effects of this act 
regardless of whether a sponsor elects that deferral  fsp fas requires certain disclosures pending further consideration of the underlying accounting issues 
the guidance in fsp fas is effective for interim or annual financial statements of fiscal years ending after december  the company has elected to defer accounting for these effects  if any  until authoritative guidance on the accounting is issued or until there is a significant event that ordinarily would call for re measurement of the plan s assets and obligations 
in december  the fasb issued fas revised fas r  employer s disclosure about pensions and other postretirement benefits 
fas r retains disclosure requirements of the original fas and requires additional disclosures relating to assets  obligations  cash flows  and net periodic benefits cost 
fas r is effective for fiscal years ending after december  interim period disclosures are effective for interim periods beginning after december  the adoption of the disclosure provisions of fas r did not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rates we hedged a portion of our original million variable rate term note  as required by our senior credit facility  by entering into an interest rate swap agreement in which we agree to exchange  at specified intervals  the calculated difference between the fixed interest rate of the swap and the variable interest rate on a portion of our debt 
this interest rate swap agreement expired june  we do not believe that our interest rate risk is material 
currency our operations outside of the united states are maintained in their local currency 
all assets and liabilities of our international subsidiaries are translated to us dollars at quarter end exchange rates 
translation adjustments arising from the use of differing exchange rates are included in accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity 
gains and losses on foreign currency transactions are included in other income expense 
for  revenues from sales to customers outside the united states were percent of total consolidated revenues  and  at year end  international accounts receivable  inventory  cash  and accounts payable were percent  percent  percent  and percent of total consolidated accounts for each of these items 
changes in the relative value of the us dollar and the euro would affect our sales  euro denominated expenses  and the us dollars value of european assets and liabilities 
if these changes were large and rapid  they could have a material effect on our results of operations 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations in recent years and periods 
there can be no assurance  however  that our business will not be adversely affected by inflation in the future
