item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general park is a leading global designer and producer of advanced electronic materials used to fabricate complex multilayer printed circuit boards and other electronic interconnect systems 
the company s customers include leading independent printed circuit board fabricators  electronic manufacturing service companies  electronic contract manufacturers and major electronic original equipment manufacturers in the computer  telecommunications  transportation  aerospace and instrumentation industries 
the severe correction and downturn that occurred in the global electronics industry early in the fiscal year ended march  and that dramatically affected the company s financial performance during that fiscal year and during the fiscal year ended march   with declines in sales by the company s north american  european and asian operations  abated during the second half of the fiscal year ended february  and  in the second half of the fiscal year  the electronic materials market in asia and the markets for the company s higher technology products strengthened 
nevertheless  the company s sales declined during the fiscal year  although not as steeply as in the prior fiscal year  with decreased sales of electronic materials in north america and europe 
while the company s fr operations in north america and europe continued to be weak during the fiscal year as almost all markets for sophisticated printed circuit materials continued to experience depressed conditions  the company s gross profit in the fiscal year was significantly greater than its gross profit in the fiscal year as a result of the company s reductions of its costs and expenses and higher percentages of sales of higher technology  higher margin products 
although the company s sales increased slightly in the six month period ended february  compared with last fiscal year s comparable period principally as a result of increases in sales of the company s advanced technology products  sales by the company s operations in asia and sales by the company s fibercote advanced composite materials business  the company s sales for the fiscal year were lower than its sales for the fiscal year as a result of declines in sales by the company s north american and european fr operations 
the electronics industry began to improve slightly at the end of the fiscal year second quarter and continued to improve in the third and fourth quarters  and there exist some indications that the improvement will continue 
however  it is not completely clear whether and to what degree the improvement is sustainable 
the company s advanced electronic materials business  its asian business unit and its fibercote advanced composite materials business performed reasonably well during the six month and twelve month periods ended february   while the company s higher volume fr business units in europe and north america performed poorly 
during the fiscal year  the company opened a facility at its advanced products business unit in arizona that had been completed in its fiscal year and that is now being well utilized  completed the construction of its facility expansion in singapore and proceeded with its final planning for the installation of a new manufacturing facility in china 
during the first half of the fiscal year  the company realigned its north american fr business operations located in new york and california 
as part of the realignment  the new york operation was scaled down to a smaller focused operation and the california operation was scaled up to a larger volume operation  and there were significant workforce reductions at the company s new york facility and significant workforce increases at the company s california facility  with the end result being a net reduction in the company s workforce in north america 
a large portion of the new york facility was mothballed 
the company has the flexibility in the future to scale back up the newburgh  new york facility if the opportunity to do so presents itself 
the realignment was designed to help the company achieve improved operating and cost efficiencies in its north american fr business and to help the company best service all of its north american customers 
as a result of the company s realignment of its north american fr business operations and related workforce reductions  the company recorded pre tax charges totaling million in the company s fiscal year first quarter  and the company recorded additional pre tax charges of million in the fiscal year second quarter due to such realignment 
the company also recorded a pre tax gain of million in the fiscal year third quarter resulting from the sale of real estate previously used by its nelco uk subsidiary  which ceased operations after its closure in the fiscal year third quarter 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this report for additional information regarding the realignment and closure 
in february  the company discontinued its financial support of dielektra gmbh  the company s wholly owned subsidiary located in cologne  germany dielektra  which supplied electronic materials to european circuit board manufacturers 
the company discontinued its support of dielektra because the market in europe had eroded to the point where the company believed it would not be possible  at any time in the foreseeable future  for the dielektra business to be viable 
dielektra had required substantial financial support from the company 
the discontinuation of the company s financial support resulted in the filing of an insolvency petition by dielektra 
the company believes that the insolvency procedure in germany will result in the eventual reorganization  sale or liquidation of dielektra 
the company intends to continue to service the higher technology european digital and rf circuit board markets through its nelco  sas business located in mirebeau  france  and its neltec  sa business located in lannemezan  france 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  the company is treating dielektra as a discontinued operation 
accordingly  the company reclassified dielektra s operating losses and charges and recorded a net loss from discontinued operations of million in the fiscal year  comprised of million of operating losses incurred by dielektra  million related to the closure of dielektra s mass lamination operation and related workforce reductions in the fiscal year first quarter and million for the write off of assets of dielektra and other costs  the company recorded a net loss from discontinued operations in the fiscal year of million  comprised of million of operating losses incurred by dielektra and million for after tax fixed asset impairment charges  and the company recorded a net loss from discontinued operations in the fiscal year of million  comprised of million of operating losses incurred by dielektra and million related to the realignment of the operations of dielektra 
furthermore  the company s sales from its continuing operations did not include sales by dielektra of million for the fiscal year  million for the fiscal year and million for the fiscal year 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this report for additional information regarding the discontinued operations 
during the fiscal year  the company recorded pre tax charges totaling million related to the write downs of fixed assets at its continuing operations in north america resulting from the realignment of its north american fr business operations in new york and california  workforce reductions at a north american business unit  and the closure of its nelco uk manufacturing facility 
these charges were only slightly offset by the pre tax gain of million realized by the company during the fiscal year second quarter in connection with the sale of its dielectric polymers  inc dpi subsidiary for million cash 
see notes  and of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this report for additional information regarding the asset write downs  workforce reductions and closure and the sale of dpi 
the company recorded a pre tax charge of million in its fiscal year third quarter for the cost of closing its nelco uk manufacturing facility located in skelmersdale  england in response to the almost complete collapse of the uk high technology circuit board industry 
for many years  nelco uk was one of the most vital parts of the company s global high technology circuit materials business  but the uk high technology circuit board industry had been devastated  and the closure of the nelco uk facility was unavoidable  as there was not enough business available in the entire uk market to justify the company s having an operation in the uk the company is supplying its few remaining customers in the uk with product produced at its nelco facility located in mirebeau  france and will continue to provide these uk customers with local account management  technical service and materials and inventory support 
in addition  the company recorded a pre tax charge of million during the fiscal year third quarter for severance payments for workforce reductions at a north american business unit 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this report for additional information regarding the closure and severance payments 
during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year  the company reassessed the recoverability of the fixed assets of those operations based on cash flow projections and determined that such fixed assets were impaired  and the company recorded pre tax impairment charges of million in the company s fiscal year fourth quarter to reduce the book values of such fixed assets to their estimated fair values 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this report for additional information regarding the asset impairment charges 
during the company s fiscal year and for several years prior thereto  more than of the company s total worldwide sales were to delco electronics corporation  a subsidiary of general motors corp 
delco  and the company s wholly owned subsidiary  nelco technology  inc nti located in tempe  arizona  had been delco s principal supplier of semi finished multilayer printed circuit board materials  commonly known as mass lamination  which were used by delco to produce finished multilayer printed circuit boards 
however  in march  the company was informed by delco that delco planned to close its printed circuit board fabrication plant and exit the printed circuit board manufacturing business 
as a result  the company s sales to delco declined during the three month period ended may   were negligible during the remainder of the fiscal year and have been nil since that time 
in may  the company and nti filed a complaint against delco and the delphi automotive systems unit of general motors corp 
in the united states district court for the district of arizona 
the complaint alleged  among other things  that delco breached its contract to purchase semi finished multilayer printed circuit boards from nti and that delphi interfered with nti s contract with delco  that delco breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing implied in the contract  that delco engaged in negligent misrepresentation and that delco fraudulently induced nti to enter into the contract 
in november  a jury awarded damages to nti in the amount of million  and in december the judge in the united states district court for the district of arizona entered judgment for nti on its claim of breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing with damages in the amount of million 
both parties appealed the decision to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit in san francisco  and in may  a panel of three judges in the court of appeals for the ninth circuit rendered a unanimous decision affirming the jury verdict 
in june  the united states district court for the district of arizona entered final judgment in favor of nti  and  on july   nti received a net amount of million in payment of such judgment 
the company recorded a non recurring  pre tax gain of million in the fiscal year second quarter related to such payment

fiscal year compared with fiscal year the company s fr operations in north america and europe continued to be weak during the fiscal year ended february  as the north american  european and  to a lesser extent  asian markets for sophisticated printed circuit materials continued to experience depressed conditions 
nevertheless  the company s continuing operations generated a profit during the fiscal year as a result of a significant improvement in its gross profit 
the company s gross profit in the fiscal year was substantially higher than the gross profit in the prior fiscal year and improved significantly in the six months ended february  as a result of the company s reductions of its costs and expenses and higher percentages of sales by the company of its higher margin  advanced technology products 
these improvements in gross profits occurred despite slightly lower levels of sales of electronic materials in the fiscal year and only slightly increased sales in the third and fourth quarters  operating inefficiencies resulting from operating certain facilities at levels far below their designed manufacturing capacities and from the company s realignment of its north american fr business operations  and competitive pressures 
the company s financial results of operations were substantially enhanced by the pre tax gain of million that the company recorded in the fiscal year second quarter related to the payment by delco electronics corporation of the judgment against delco in favor of the company s subsidiary  nelco technology  inc  in its lawsuit against delco  which more than offset the pre tax charges of million that the company recorded in the fiscal year related to the company s realignment of its north american fr business operations in the first and second quarters 
in the fiscal year  the company classified dielektra s operating losses and charges and accordingly recorded a net loss from discontinued operations of million as a result of the company s discontinuation of its financial support of dielektra in february  the ensuing insolvency of dielektra  and the company s treatment of dielektra as a discontinued operation 
the net loss from discontinued operations was comprised of million of operating losses incurred by dielektra  million related to the closure of dielektra s mass lamination operation and related workforce reductions in the fiscal year first quarter and million for the write off of assets of dielektra and other costs 
in the fiscal year  the company recorded a net loss from discontinued operations of million  comprised of million of operating losses incurred by dielektra and million for after tax fixed asset impairment charges 
in addition  the company s sales from its continuing operations excluded sales by dielektra of million for the portion of the fiscal year during which the company was supporting dielektra and million for the fiscal year 
operating results of the company s advanced composite materials business also improved significantly during the fiscal year primarily as a result of increased sales and higher percentages of sales of higher margin products 
results of operations net sales from continuing operations for the fiscal year ended february  declined less than to million from million for the fiscal year ended march  the decrease in net sales from continuing operations was principally the result of lower unit volumes of materials shipped by the company s fr operations in north america and europe  almost entirely offset by higher unit volumes of materials shipped by the company s operations in asia 
the company s sales from continuing operations did not include sales by dielektra of million for the fiscal year and million for the fiscal year 
the company s foreign operations accounted for million of sales  or of the company s total sales worldwide from continuing operations  during the fiscal year  compared with million of sales  or of total sales worldwide from continuing operations  during the fiscal year and of total sales worldwide from continuing operating during the fiscal year 
sales by the company s foreign operations during the fiscal year increased from the fiscal year due to increases in sales in asia and france while sales by the company s operations in england were nil during the fiscal year 
the overall gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the company s worldwide continuing operations improved to during the fiscal year compared with during the fiscal year 
the improvement in the gross profit margin was attributable to higher percentages of sales of higher margin  advanced technology products  as high performance materials accounted for of worldwide sales from continuing operations for the fiscal year compared with for the prior fiscal year  and reductions in the company s costs from the fiscal year  which were only partially offset by lower sales volumes and inefficiencies caused by operating certain facilities at levels below their designed manufacturing capacities 
the company s cost of sales decreased in the fiscal year compared to the prior fiscal year due to personnel reductions and cost savings resulting from the company s realignment of its north american fr business  other cost reduction measures implemented by the company  including workforce reductions and the reduction of overtime  and lower production volumes during the first and second quarters of the fiscal year 
in addition  the company continued to implement an annual salary freeze for significant numbers of salaried employees  especially senior management employees  and paid no performance bonuses or significantly reduced bonuses and other incentives 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased slightly during the fiscal year compared with the fiscal year  and these expenses  measured as a percentage of sales  were during the fiscal year compared with during the fiscal year 
the slight increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in the fiscal year was a result of increased shipping costs incurred by the company to meet its customers customized manufacturing and quick turn around requirements 
the company recorded a pre tax gain of million in the fiscal year third quarter resulting from the sale of real estate in skelmersdale  england previously used by its nelco uk subsidiary  which ceased operations after its closure in the fiscal year third quarter  and a pre tax gain of million during the fiscal year second quarter related to the payment by delco electronics corporation of the judgment against delco in favor of the company s subsidiary  nelco technology  inc  in its lawsuit against delco

the after tax impact of these fixed asset impairments was million 
in addition  the company recorded pre tax charges totaling million in the fiscal year third quarter related to the closure of its nelco uk manufacturing facility and severance costs at a north american business unit and a pre tax gain of million in the fiscal year second quarter in connection with the sale of dpi on june  for million in cash 
the net pre tax charge for all these items for the fiscal year was million  and the net after tax charge for the fiscal year was million 
for the reasons set forth above  earnings from continuing operations were million for the fiscal year  including the pre tax gains described above resulting from the sale of real estate in england and the payment by delco electronics corporation of the judgment against it in favor of the company s subsidiary  nelco technology  inc  in nelco s lawsuit against delco and the pre tax charges described above related to the realignment of the company s north american fr business operations and related workforce reductions 
this compares with a loss from continuing operations of million for the fiscal year  including the pre tax charges described above related to the write downs of fixed assets at continuing operations in north america  the closure of the nelco uk manufacturing facility and severance costs at a north american business unit and the pre tax gain described above related to the sale of dpi

the company s investments were primarily short term taxable instruments 
the company incurred no interest expense during the  or fiscal years 
see liquidity and capital resources elsewhere in this item the company s effective income tax rate was for the fiscal year compared to an income tax benefit of for the fiscal year 
the company s effective income tax rate for continuing operations  excluding the pre tax gains and the pre tax charges described above  for the fiscal year was compared with an income tax benefit of for the fiscal year 
the company s net earnings from continuing operations for the fiscal year were million  including the gains described above resulting from the sale of real estate in england and the payment by delco electronics corporation of the judgment in favor of the company s subsidiary  nelco technology  inc  and the charges described above related to the realignment of the company s north american fr business operations and related workforce reductions 
this compares with a net loss of million for the fiscal year  including the charges of million described above related to the write downs of fixed assets at continuing operations in north america  the closure of the nelco uk manufacturing facility and severance costs at a north american business unit and the gain described above related to the sale of dpi

fiscal year compared with fiscal year the company s continuing operations continued to be weak during the fiscal year ended march  as the north american  european and  to a lesser extent  asian markets for sophisticated printed circuit materials continued to experience severely depressed conditions during the fiscal year 
nevertheless  the company s gross profit in the fiscal year ended march  was significantly more than the gross profit in the fiscal year ended march  as a result of the company s reductions of its costs and expenses and higher percentages of sales of higher technology  higher margin products 
in addition to its depressed financial results of operations  the company recorded pre tax  fixed asset impairment charges of million in the fiscal year fourth quarter related to the writedowns of fixed assets at its continuing operations in north america 
the company also recorded pre tax charges of million in the fiscal year third quarter in connection with the closure of its nelco uk manufacturing facility in skelmersdale  england and severance costs at a north american business unit and realized a pre tax gain of million in the fiscal year second quarter in connection with the sale of its dpi subsidiary 
in the fiscal year  the company recorded pre tax charges totaling million related to the sale of the assets and business of nti  the company s wholly owned subsidiary that manufactured semi finished printed circuit boards  commonly known as mass lamination  in tempe  arizona  the closure of a related support facility in arizona and severance payments for workforce reductions at the company s continuing operations 
as a result of the company s discontinuation of its financial support of dielektra in february  the ensuing insolvency of dielektra and the company s treatment of dielektra as a discontinued operation  the company reclassified dielektra s operating losses and charges and accordingly recorded a net loss from discontinued operations of million in the fiscal year  comprised of million of operating losses incurred by dielektra and million for after tax fixed asset impairment charges  and the company recorded a net loss from discontinued operations in the fiscal year of million  comprised of million of operating losses incurred by dielektra and million related to the realignment of the operations of dielektra 
in addition  the company s sales from its continuing operations do not include sales by dielektra of million for the fiscal year and million for the fiscal year 
the continuing low levels of sales of electronic materials were largely responsible for the company s results of continuing operations for the fiscal year ended march  the north american and european markets for sophisticated printed circuits continued to be severely depressed during the fiscal year  and the company s electronic materials operations located in those regions suffered as a result  although the company believes it gained market share with certain of its electronic materials customers 
the company s results of continuing operations and gross profit improved in the fiscal year compared to the fiscal year principally as a result of the electronic material business reductions in costs and expenses despite the decrease in sales and the concomitant operation of the company s facilities at levels far below their designed manufacturing capacities 
operating results of the company s advanced composite materials business also improved during the fiscal year primarily as a result of higher percentages of sales of higher margin products 
results of operations net sales from continuing operations for the fiscal year ended march  declined to million from million for the fiscal year ended march  the decrease in net sales was principally the result of lower unit volumes of materials shipped by the company s operations in north america  partially offset by higher unit volumes of materials shipped by the company s operations in asia and europe 
the comparative decrease in net sales was also influenced by the fact that the company s net sales in the fiscal year ended march  benefited from significantly higher sales in march than in any subsequent month  as the downturn in the global electronics industry and in the company s sales occurred in the fiscal year first quarter 
the company s sales from continuing operations do not include sales by dielektra of million for the fiscal year and million for the fiscal year 
the company s foreign operations accounted for million of sales  or of the company s total sales worldwide from continuing operations  during the fiscal year  compared with million of sales  or of total sales worldwide from continuing operations  during the fiscal year and of total sales worldwide from continuing operations during the fiscal year 
sales by the company s foreign operations during the fiscal year increased slightly from the fiscal year due to increases in sales in asia while sales by the company s operations in england declined during the fiscal year compared with the prior fiscal year 
the overall gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the company s worldwide continuing operations improved to during the fiscal year compared with during the fiscal year 
the improvement in the gross margin was attributable to the significant declines in costs and expenses from the fiscal year  production efficiencies resulting from enhanced manufacturing automation  and increases in market share with certain key electronic materials customers  which were only partially offset by lower sales volumes and inefficiencies caused by operating certain facilities at levels below their designed manufacturing capacities 
gross profit was also positively impacted by higher percentages of sales of higher technology  higher margin products  as high performance materials accounted for of worldwide sales from continuing operations for the fiscal year compared with for the prior fiscal year 
the company s cost of sales decreased significantly as a result of lower production volumes and cost reduction measures implemented by the company  including significant workforce reductions and the reduction of overtime  and the company continued to implement an annual salary freeze for significant numbers of salaried employees  especially senior management employees  and paid no performance bonuses or significantly reduced bonuses and other incentives 
selling  general and administrative expenses declined by million  or by  during the fiscal year compared with the fiscal year  and these expenses  measured as a percentage of sales  were during the fiscal year compared with during the fiscal year

the decrease in investment income was attributable to lower prevailing interest rates during the fiscal year 
the company s investments were primarily short term taxable instruments 
the company incurred no interest expense during the or fiscal years 
see liquidity and capital resources elsewhere in this item the company s effective income tax rate was a benefit of for the fiscal year compared to a benefit of for the fiscal year 
this decrease in the effective tax rate benefit was the result of a valuation allowance on the tax benefit from losses sustained in the fiscal year that will be carried forward to future years for tax purposes 
the valuation allowance eliminated the current recognition of the tax benefit from the tax loss carryforward due to the uncertainty of the use of such benefit 
the loss from continuing operations for the fiscal year  including the after tax charges of million described above related to the write downs of fixed assets at continuing operations in north america  the closure of the nelco uk manufacturing facility and severance costs at a north american business unit  was million  compared to a loss from continuing operations of million for the fiscal year  including the pre tax charges described above related to a workforce reduction at a business unit  the sale of nti  the closure of a related support facility and severance for the lay off of employees at the company s continuing operations

liquidity and capital resources at february   the company s cash and temporary investments were million compared with million at march   the end of the company s fiscal year 
the increase in the company s cash and investment position at february  was attributable to cash received from delco electronics corporation in payment of the judgment in favor of the company s subsidiary  nelco technology  inc  in its lawsuit against delco  partially offset by purchases of property  plant and equipment and the payment of dividends 
the company s working capital which includes cash and temporary investments was million at february  compared with million at march  the increase in working capital at february  compared with march  was due principally to higher cash and cash equivalents and higher accounts receivable  offset in part by lower inventories and other current assets and higher accrued liabilities 
the increase in accounts receivable at february  compared with march  was a result principally of higher sales in the fiscal year fourth quarter than in the fiscal year fourth quarter 
the company s current ratio the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was to at february  compared with to at march  during the fiscal year  million of cash provided by the company s operating activities included million paid as severance in connection with workforce reductions and million that the company received on july  from delco electronics corporation in settlement of the lawsuit by the company s subsidiary  nelco technology  inc  against delco

net expenditures for property  plant and equipment were million  million and million in the  and fiscal years  respectively 
the company sold its dpi subsidiary on june  for million in cash and recorded a pre tax gain of million in the fiscal year second quarter in connection with the sale 
at february  and march   the company had no long term debt 
the company believes its financial resources will be sufficient  for the foreseeable future  to provide for continued investment in working capital and property  plant and equipment and for general corporate purposes 
such resources would also be available for purchases of the company s common stock  appropriate acquisitions and other expansions of the company s business 
the company is not aware of any circumstances or events that are reasonably likely to occur that could materially affect its liquidity 
the company s contractual obligations and other commercial commitments to make future payments under contracts  such as lease agreements  consist only of the operating lease commitments described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
the company has no long term debt  capital lease obligations  unconditional purchase obligations or other long term obligations  standby letters of credit  guarantees  standby repurchase obligations or other commercial commitments or contingent commitments  other than two standby letters of credit in the total amount of million to secure the company s obligations under its workers compensation insurance program

the company believes that  as a general matter  its policies  practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and that its handling  manufacture  use and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances are in accord with environmental laws and regulations 
however  mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies  which were generally in compliance with applicable laws at the time of the operations in question  the company  like other companies engaged in similar businesses  is a party to claims by government agencies and third parties and has incurred remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs associated with environmental matters 
additional claims and costs involving past environmental matters may continue to arise in the future 
it is the company s policy to record appropriate liabilities for such matters when remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated 
in the  and fiscal years  the company charged approximately million  million and million  respectively  against pre tax income for remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs including legal fees 
while annual expenditures have generally been constant from year to year  and may increase over time  the company expects it will be able to fund such expenditures from cash flow from operations 
the timing of expenditures depends on a number of factors  including regulatory approval of cleanup projects  remedial techniques to be utilized and agreements with other parties 
at february   the recorded liability in liabilities from discontinued operations for environmental matters related to dielektra was million and the recorded liability in accrued liabilities for environmental matters was million compared with a total record liability in accrued liabilities for environmental matters of million at march  management does not expect that environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on the liquidity  capital resources  business or consolidated financial position of the company

the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
sales allowances the company provides for the estimated costs of sales allowances at the time such costs can be reasonably estimated 
the company is focused on manufacturing the highest quality electronic materials and other products possible and employs stringent manufacturing process controls and works with raw material suppliers who have dedicated themselves to complying with the company s specifications and technical requirements 
however  if the quality of the company s products declined  the company may incur higher sales allowances 
bad debt the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory the company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketability based upon the age of the inventory and assumptions about future demand for the company s products and market conditions 
valuation of long lived assets the company assesses the impairment of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
important factors that could trigger an impairment review include  but are not limited to  significant negative industry or economic trends and significant changes in the use of the company s assets or strategy of the overall business 
income taxes carrying value of the company s net deferred tax assets assumes that the company will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions  based on estimates and assumptions 
if these estimates and assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record additional valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expense in the company s consolidated statement of operations 
management evaluates the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly and assesses the need for additional valuation allowances quarterly 
restructuring during the fiscal years ended february  and march   the company recorded significant charges in connection with the realignment of its north american fr business operations  the closures of the mass lamination operation of dielektra gmbh in germany and the company s manufacturing facility in england and employee severance costs  and during the fiscal year ended march   the company recorded significant charges in connection with the restructuring relating to the sale of nelco technology  inc  the closure of a related support facility and the realignment of dielektra  gmbh 
these charges include estimates pertaining to employee separation costs and the settlements of contractual obligations resulting from the company s actions 
although the company does not anticipate significant changes  the actual costs incurred by the company may differ from these estimates 
contingencies and litigation the company is subject to a small number of proceedings  lawsuits and other claims related to environmental  employment  product and other matters 
the company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes in these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each individual issue 
the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters 
pension and other employee benefit programs dielektra has significant pension costs that are developed from actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates and wage inflation rates 
the company is required to consider current market conditions  including changes in interest rates and wage costs  in selecting these assumptions 
changes in the related pension costs may occur in the future in addition to changes resulting from fluctuations in the company s related headcount due to changes in the assumptions 
the company s obligations for workers compensation claims and employee health care benefits are effectively self insured 
the company uses an insurance company administrator to process all such claims and benefits 
the company accrues its workers compensation liability based upon the claim reserves established by the third party administrator and historical experience 
the company s employee health insurance benefit liability is based on its historical claims experience 
the company and certain of its subsidiaries have a non contributory profit sharing retirement plan covering their regular full time employees 
in addition  the company s subsidiaries have various bonus and incentive compensation programs  most of which are determined at management s discretion 
the company s reserves associated with these self insured liabilities and benefit programs are reviewed by management for adequacy at the end of each quarterly reporting period
