item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements  including the notes thereto  which are included elsewhere in this annual report 
we operate as a real estate investment trust  or reit  that principally acquires  renovates  develops and manages community and neighborhood shopping centers located predominately in high growth markets in the southern united states 
our shopping centers are primarily anchored by supermarkets or other necessity oriented retailers such as drug stores or discount retail stores 
as of december   our portfolio consisted of properties  comprising supermarket anchored shopping centers  drug store anchored shopping centers  other retail anchored shopping centers  one self storage facility  one industrial and five retail developments  as well as non controlling interests in two unconsolidated joint ventures that own and operate commercial properties 
we believe we distinguish ourselves by owning and operating shopping centers anchored by supermarkets or necessity oriented retailers in high density areas that are experiencing high population growth 
our goal is to own and operate properties containing dominant supermarket operators and a diverse tenant mix 
we believe that these characteristics combine to reduce the vulnerability of our properties to economic downturns  enhance consumer traffic through our properties and generate more stable cash flows over time 
we derive substantially all of our revenue from tenants under existing leases at our properties 
our business is generally dependent on the performance of the economy in the areas in which we own properties 
changes in the economic environment tend to have a direct effect on our tenants businesses and  therefore  their ability to continue to pay us rent 
in  the overall us economy began to demonstrate sustained economic growth 
this growth  as well as the prevailing low interest rate environment  contributed to the growth in our cash flows and allowed us to increase the occupancy rates at our centers for the year 
we have followed a disciplined approach and taken advantage of the improving economic environment in our markets 
first  we continue to concentrate on shopping centers in the southern region of the united states by acquiring new centers in high growth  high density areas  developing and redeveloping centers in these areas and selling properties that no longer meet our investment criteria 
second  we also have repaid certain high interest rate mortgage debt and obtained a variable rate unsecured revolving credit facility on what we consider to be favorable financial and legal terms 
third  we were able to access the capital markets for additional equity financing 
the highlights of our activity reflect this strategy 
o we completed a statutory merger with irt property company acquiring properties comprising approximately million square feet of gross leasable area located in ten states in the southern region of the united states 
we now have shopping centers in twelve states primarily in florida  texas  georgia  north carolina  south carolina and louisiana 
o we acquired an additional supermarket anchored centers  an outparcel and land held for future development for approximately million 
o we sold properties  a property held by a joint venture and a joint venture interest for gross proceeds of million 
o we completed the development of a supermarket anchored shopping center containing  square feet of gross leasable area and have over development and redevelopments underway 
o we completed two public equity offerings of our common stock  raising proceeds of million and issuing million shares of our common stock 
o we entered into a million unsecured revolving credit facility and prepaid million of fixed and variable rate debt 
our fixed rate mortgage debt outstanding of million is at a weighted average interest rate of  our million fixed rate senior unsecured notes are at a weighted average interest rate of and our variable rate revolving credit facility has an interest rate currently at including the effect of interest swaps 
o we increased the base rental rate by on lease renewals aggregating  square feet to per square foot 
we executed new leases totaling  square feet at an average rate of per square foot and we increased our occupancy rate to in the portfolio 
however  our long term operating cash flow is dependent on the continued occupancy of our properties  the rents that we are able to charge to our tenants and the ability of these tenants to make their rental payments 
therefore  the main long term threat to our business is our dependence on the viability of our anchor and other tenants 
general economic downturns and competition from national and regional supercenters  such as wal mart or other discount retailers  may have an increasing adverse impact on the business of our tenants by taking customers or reducing operating margins 
for instance  winn dixie stores inc  which has supermarkets in of our centers  has recently announced deteriorating operating results and has had the rating on its senior notes downgraded 
however  we believe that these risks are mitigated by concentrating on high density  urban areas  leasing to the dominant supermarket operators in the markets in which we own properties and maintaining a diverse tenant mix 
we are not currently aware of any pending tenant bankruptcies that are likely to materially affect our rental revenues 
we are optimistic that we are well positioned to take advantage of the sustained growth of the economy and continuing low interest rate environment while our largely fixed rate indebtedness protects us from increases in interest rates in the near term 
short term liquidity needs as of december   we had  in cash and million available to be drawn under our revolving credit facilities 
our cash flow generated by operations was million for the year ended december  our short term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for operating and other expenses directly associated with our portfolio of properties  general and administrative expenses including payroll and related costs  interest expense and scheduled principal payments on our outstanding debt  capital expenditures incurred to facilitate the leasing of space eg  tenant improvements and leasing commissions  development and redevelopment activities  quarterly dividends paid to our common shareholders and distributions made to holders of operating partnership units 
historically  we have satisfied these requirements principally through cash generated from operations 
we believe that cash generated from operations and borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our short term liquidity requirements  however  there are certain factors that may have a material adverse effect on our cash flow 
our current development plans include over development and redevelopment projects  the aggregate cost of which including costs incurred in prior years on these projects is expected to be approximately million of which million remains unfunded based on our current plans 
we intend to fund these costs from our unsecured revolving credit facilities 
we may incur significant expenditures in connection with the re leasing of our retail space  principally in the form of tenant improvements and leasing commissions 
the amounts of these expenditures can vary significantly  depending on negotiations with tenants and the willingness of tenants to pay higher base rents over the life of the leases 
we also incur expenditures for certain recurring capital expenses 
we expect to pay for re leasing and recurring capital expenditures out of cash from operations 
as a reit  we are required to distribute at least of our taxable income to our stockholders on an annual basis 
therefore  as a general matter  it is unlikely that we will be able to retain any substantial cash balances that could be used to meet our liquidity needs 
instead  these needs must be met with cash generated from current operations and external sources of capital 
during  we paid dividends on our common stock in an amount equal to per share 
the maintenance of these dividends is subject to various factors  including the discretion of our board of directors  our ability to pay dividends under maryland law  the availability of cash to make the necessary dividend payments and the effect of reit distribution requirements 
we also make regular distributions on units in partnerships that we control 
long term liquidity needs our long term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for the principal amount of our long term debt as it matures  significant non recurring capital expenditures that need to be made periodically at our properties  development and redevelopment projects that we undertake at our properties and the costs associated with acquisitions of properties or other companies 
historically  we have satisfied these requirements principally through what we believe to be the most advantageous source of capital available at the time  which has included the incurrence of new debt through borrowings under credit facilities and the issuance of debt securities  sales of common stock  capital raised through the disposition of assets  repayment by third parties of notes receivable and joint venture capital transactions 
we believe that these sources of capital will continue to be available in the future to fund our long term capital needs  however  there are certain factors that may have a material adverse effect on our ability to access these capital sources 
our ability to incur additional debt is dependent upon a number of factors  including our degree of leverage  the value of our unencumbered assets  our credit rating and borrowing restrictions imposed by existing lenders 
currently  we have investment grade credit ratings for our unsecured senior debt from two major rating agencies standard poor s and moody s investors service 
a downgrade in outlook or rating by a rating agency can occur at any time if the agency perceives an adverse change in our financial condition  results of operations or ability to service debt 
if such a downgrade occurs  it would increase the interest rate currently payable under our existing credit facilities  it likely would increase the costs associated with obtaining future financing  and it potentially could adversely affect our ability to obtain future financing 
the indentures under which our publicly traded debt securities are issued also contain certain restrictions on our ability to incur debt and other financial covenants 
the following table sets forth certain information regarding future contractual obligations as of december  in thousands payments due by period less than more than contractual obligation total year years years years mortgage notes payable scheduled amortization      balloon payments      total mortgage obligations      unsecured revolving credit facilities   unsecured senior notes     capital leases operating leases development and redevelopment    total contractual obligations      off balance sheet arrangements we have an off balance sheet joint venture and other unconsolidated arrangements with varying structures 
as of december   our off balance sheet arrangements were as follows o letters of credit totaling million have been provided as security for certain performance requirements 
o our unconsolidated joint venture  pg partners  has aggregate outstanding indebtedness of approximately million  bearing fixed rate interest at and maturing april principal and interest payments of  are due monthly which are paid out of operating cash flow from the property 
our investment in this joint venture is million 
o we have committed to fund million  based on current plans and estimates  in order to complete pending development and redevelopment projects 
these obligations  comprised principally of construction contracts  are generally due as the work is performed and are expected to be financed by our available credit facilities 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations provides additional information related to our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates and if necessary  adjusts its estimates and judgments  including those related to real estate and development assets  revenue recognition in conjunction with providing development  leasing and management services and equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures 
management believes that the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
real estate properties and development assets 
we capitalize acquisition and construction costs  property taxes  interest and other miscellaneous costs that are directly identifiable with a project  from pre acquisition until the time that construction is complete and the development is ready for its intended use  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
and sfas no 
we allocate the capitalized project costs to the various components of the project based on the components relative fair values 
our cost allocation method requires the use of management estimates regarding the fair market value of each project component 
management bases its estimates on current market appraisals  comparable sales  existing sale and purchase contracts  replacement cost  historical experience  and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the fair market values of real estate assets 
actual results may differ from these estimates and anticipated returns on a project  as well as the gain or loss on disposition of the individual project components  could vary significantly from estimated amounts 
management reviews long lived assets used in operations for impairment when there is an event or change in circumstances that indicates that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable and the future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset are less than its carrying amount 
if such asset is considered to be impaired  we record impairment losses and reduce the carrying amount of the impaired asset to an amount that reflects the fair value of the asset at the time impairment is evident 
our impairment review process relies on management s judgment regarding the indicators of impairment  the remaining life of the asset used to generate the asset s undiscounted cash flows  and the fair value of the asset at a particular point in time 
management uses historical experience  current market appraisals and various other assumptions to form the basis for making judgments about the impairment of real estate assets 
under different assumptions or conditions  the asset impairment analysis may yield a different outcome  which would alter the ultimate return on our assets  as well as the gain or loss on the eventual disposition of the asset 
business combinations 
we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies and properties to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed  based on their estimated fair values 
fair value is defined as the amount at which that asset could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties other than in a forced or liquidation sale 
in order to allocate the purchase price of acquired companies and properties to the tangible and intangible assets acquired  we identify and estimate the fair value of the land  buildings  and improvements  review the leases to determine the existence of  and estimate the fair value of  any contractual or other legal rights and investigation of the existence of  and estimate the fair value of  any other identifiable intangible assets 
such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to intangible assets 
the cost approach is used as the primary method to estimate the fair value of buildings  improvements and other assets 
the market value approach is used as the primary method to estimate the fair value of land 
the determination of the fair value of contractual intangibles is based on the costs to originate a lease including commissions and legal costs to the extent that such costs are not already incurred with a new lease that has been negotiated in connection with the purchase of a property 
in place lease values are based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each lease and our overall relationship with each tenant 
among the factors considered in the allocation of these values include the nature of the existing relationship with the tenant  the tenant s credit quality  the expectation of lease renewals  the estimated carrying costs of the property during a hypothetical expected lease up period  current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases 
estimated carrying costs include real estate taxes  insurance  other property operating costs and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the hypothetical expected lease up periods  under specific market conditions 
above market  below market and in place lease values are determined based on the present value using discount rate reflecting the risks associated with the leases acquired of the difference between i the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the leases negotiated and in place at the time of acquisition and ii management s estimate of fair market lease rates for the property or equivalent property  measured over a period equal to the remaining non cancelable term of the lease 
the value of contractual intangibles is amortized over the remaining term of each lease 
critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets and our assumptions on what marketplace participants would use in making estimates of fair value  include but are not limited to future expected cash flows  estimated carrying costs  estimated origination costs  lease up periods  and the tenant risk attributes  as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired lease will continue to be used in the our portfolio  and discount rates used in these calculations 
management s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable  but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
assumptions may not always reflect unanticipated events and changes in circumstances that may occur 
in making such estimates  management uses a number of sources  including appraisals that may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of the respective property or other market data 
management also considers information obtained in its pre acquisition due diligence and market and leasing activities in estimating the fair value of tangible and intangible assets acquired 
goodwill 
effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under statement  we are required to perform annual impairment tests of its goodwill and intangible assets and more frequently in certain circumstances 
management has elected to test for goodwill impairment in november of each year 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step process  which requires management to make judgments in determining what assumptions to use in the calculation 
the first step of the process consists of estimating the fair value of each reporting unit and comparing those estimated fair values with the carrying values  which include the allocated goodwill 
if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value  a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment by determining an implied fair value of goodwill 
the determination of a reporting unit s implied fair value of goodwill requires us to allocate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit 
any unallocated fair value represents the implied fair value of goodwill  which is compared to its corresponding carrying value 
the key assumptions we made to determine the fair value of our reporting units each property is considered a reporting unit under sfas no 
included a net operating income  b cash flows  and c estimated the fair value  which was based on our experience in evaluating acquisitions and market conditions 
a variance in the net operating income or discount rate could have had a significant impact on the amount of the goodwill impairment charge recorded 
management cannot predict the occurrence of certain future events that might adversely effect the reported value of goodwill that totaled million at december  such events include  but are not limited to  strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions  the impact of the economic environment on our tenants  or a material negative change in its relationships with significant tenants 
revenue recognition 
as lessor  we retain substantially all the risks and benefits of property ownership and account for our leases as operating leases 
rental income is recognized over the lease term on a straight line basis as it becomes receivable according to the provisions of the lease 
revenue from percentage rent is recognized when tenants reported sales have reached certain levels specified in the respective leases 
recoveries from tenants for real estate taxes and other operating expenses are recognized as revenue in the period when the applicable costs are incurred 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of tenants to make required rent payments 
the computation of this allowance is based on the tenants payment history and current credit quality 
if our estimate of collectibility differs from the cash received the timing and amount of our reported revenue could be impacted 
investments in unconsolidated joint ventures 
we do not consider ourselves to be in control of joint ventures when major business decisions require the approval of at least one other managing equity owner 
accordingly  we account for the two joint ventures in which we do not retain unilateral control under the equity method 
we calculate the equity in income or loss earned from our unconsolidated joint ventures based on each equity owners economic ownership  which is estimated based on anticipated stabilized cash flows as they would be allocated to each equity owner based on how cash flow is distributed 
generally  under the terms of the respective joint venture agreements  net ordinary cash flow is distributed to each equity owner in accordance with such owner s equity ownership percentages 
accounting for stock options 
we apply the intrinsic value method as prescribed by accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations in measuring stock based compensation  including options 
accordingly  no compensation expense has been recognized for options granted under our compensation plan as no grants were made at less than market value 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  compensation expense would be recognized based upon the fair value of the award at the grant date 
results of operations on february   we completed our acquisition of irt property company  or irt  by statutory merger 
as a result of the merger  we acquired properties encompassing approximately million square feet of gross leasable area and including supermarket anchored shopping centers  four drug store anchored shopping center  other retail anchored shopping centers  an industrial property and two development projects 
in connection with the merger  we paid aggregate cash consideration of approximately million  issued approximately million shares of our common stock and assumed approximately million of mortgages  unsecured indebtedness and other liabilities  including million of irt s senior unsecured indebtedness 
the acquisition of irt was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and the results of irt are included in our consolidated financial statements since february  during  we sold properties including a property held by an unconsolidated joint venture and a joint venture interest that no longer met our investment criteria 
we also acquired ten retail properties  one outparcel and a property held for future development 
in september  we acquired centrefund realty us corporation  or cefus  and united investors realty trust  or uirt 
as a result of these acquisitions  we acquired shopping centers and other retail properties which contained an aggregate of approximately million square feet of gross leasable area 
the acquisition of cefus has been accounted for on a push down basis and partially in a manner similar to a pooling of interests 
our results for the period between august   the day our affiliate  gazit group ltd  acquired its beneficial interest in first capital realty inc  and september  have been restated to consolidate our operations with those of cefus subject to a minority interest in cefus 
our results from september   the day we acquired cefus  eliminate this minority interest 
the acquisition of uirt was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and the results of uirt are included in our consolidated financial statements since september  we derive substantially all of our revenues from rents received from tenants under existing leases on each of our properties 
these revenues include fixed base rents  recoveries of expenses that we have incurred and which we pass through to the individual tenants and percentage rents that are based on specified percentages of tenants revenues  in each case as provided in the particular leases 
our primary cash expenses consist of our property operating expenses  which include real estate taxes  repairs and maintenance  management expenses  insurance  utilities and other expenses  general and administrative expenses  which include payroll  office expenses  professional fees and other administrative expenses  and interest expense  primarily on mortgage unsecured senior debt and revolving credit facilities indebtedness 
in addition  we incur substantial non cash charges for depreciation and amortization on our properties 
we also capitalize certain expenses  such as taxes and interest  incurred in respect of property under development or redevelopment until the property is ready for its intended use 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  total rental income increased by million  or  to million in from million in the following factors accounted for this difference o the acquisition of irt increased rental income by approximately million  o properties acquired during increased rental income by approximately million  o the full year benefited from properties acquired during which increased rental income by approximately million  o same property rental income increased by million in due to higher tenant expense and rental income  o these increases were offset by a  decrease in rental income from under development and redevelopment properties 
property operating expenses increased by million  or  to million for from million in the following factors accounted for this difference o the acquisition of irt increased operating expenses by approximately million  o properties acquired during increased operating expenses by approximately million  o properties acquired during increased the full year operating expenses by  and o same property operating expenses increased by  as a result of property maintenance expenses 
rental property depreciation and amortization increased by million  or  to million for from million in the following factors accounted for this difference o the acquisition of irt increased depreciation and amortization by approximately million  o properties acquired during increased depreciation and amortization by million  o properties acquired during increased the full year depreciation expense by  and o completed development and redevelopment activities increased depreciation and amortization by million 
interest expense increased by million  or  to million for from million in this difference was primarily due to o an increase in interest expense of million as a result of the assumption of mortgage loans and senior unsecured debt in the acquisition of irt  o interest incurred on the debt related to the acquisition of properties during of  offset by a million decrease in same property interest expense  related to the repayment of certain existing mortgage notes  o an increase in revolving credit facility interest of million primarily related to the acquisition of irt  the acquisition of properties and repayment of various mortgage loans  o an increase of million related to interest on the unsecured senior notes  and o a decrease in interest expense attributable to capitalized interest of million related to development and redevelopment activities 
general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million for from million in compensation and employer related expenses increased by million and other general office expenses increased by million 
these expense increases were primarily due to the increase in staffing resulting from the irt acquisition 
investment income decreased by  due to the principal repayments received on notes receivable and repayments by stockholders of loans related to previous stock purchases 
during  we settled certain mortgage notes at a discount and recognized a loss on the extinguishment of debt of approximately  we sold seven properties including a property held by a joint venture  a joint venture interest and have two properties that are held for sale at december  the operating results of these properties of million are being reflected as income from rental properties sold or held for sale 
the sales of the properties and joint venture interest produced a gain of million for the discontinued operations reflect a reclassification of operations for properties sold during and we recognized a gain of million in related to a gain on the disposal of properties sold during minority interest increased by  related to the interests that were part of the acquisition of irt 
as a result of the foregoing  net income increased by million  or  to million for from million in year ended december  compared to year ended december  total rental income increased by million  or  to million in from million in the following factors accounted for this difference o the acquisition of uirt increased rental income by approximately million  and o properties acquired during increased rental income by approximately million 
property operating expenses increased by million  or  to million for from million in the following factors accounted for this difference o the acquisition of uirt increased operating expenses by approximately million  o properties acquired during increased operating expenses by approximately million  and o property management expenses increased by million as a result of managing a larger portfolio of properties  of which  was due to an increase in salaries and benefits 
rental property depreciation and amortization increased by million  or  to million for from million in the following factors accounted for this difference o the acquisition of uirt increased depreciation and amortization by approximately million  and o properties acquired during increased depreciation and amortization by approximately  interest expense increased by million  or  to million for from million in this difference was primarily due to o an increase in interest expense of million as a result of the assumption of mortgage loans in the acquisition of uirt  o interest incurred on the debt related to the acquisition of properties during of million  o an increase in revolving credit facility interest of  primarily related to higher average balances  and o these increases in interest expense were partially offset by the repayment of nine loans which reduced interest by million and an increase in capitalized interest related to development activity decreasing interest expense by  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million for from million in compensation and employer related expenses increased by million and other general office expenses increased by million  of which  was related to professional fees   was related to the write off of previously capitalized pre acquisition due diligence costs for projects that did not materialize  and  was related to an increase in public relations costs 
these expense increases were due to the increase in staffing resulting from the cefus and uirt acquisitions 
during  we settled a mortgage note at a discount and recognized a gain on the extinguishment of debt of million 
minority interest decreased by million due to the elimination of the minority interests in the acquisition of cefus in as a result of the foregoing  net income increased by million  or  to million for from million in liquidity and capital resources we anticipate that cash flows from operating activities will continue to provide adequate capital for dividend payments in accordance with the irs reit requirements and our operating needs 
depending on capital market conditions  we anticipate using cash on hand  borrowings under our existing unsecured revolving credit facilities  issuance of unsecured public debt and equity as well as other similar financing  to provide the necessary capital to achieve growth 
cash flows our net cash provided by operations was million for the year ended december  this amount included net income of million and adjustments for non cash and gain on sale items of million  offset by an increase in operating assets over operating liabilities of million

debt on february   we entered into a million unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks for which wells fargo bank  national association is the sole lead arranger and administrative agent 
this facility bears interest at our option at i libor plus to  depending on the credit ratings of our senior unsecured long term notes or ii at the greater of x wells fargo s prime rate and y the federal funds rate plus 
the facility also includes a competitive bid option which allows us to conduct auctions among the participating banks for borrowings in an amount not to exceed million  a million swing line facility for short term borrowings  a million letter of credit commitment and may  at our request  be increased up to a total commitment of million 
the facility expires february  with a one year extension option 
in addition  the facility contains customary covenants  including financial covenants regarding debt levels  total liabilities  interest coverage  ebitda levels  unencumbered properties  permitted investments and others 
the facility also prohibits stockholder distributions in excess of of funds from operations calculated at the end of each fiscal quarter for the four fiscal quarters then ending 
notwithstanding this limitation  we can make stockholder distributions to avoid income taxes on asset sales 
if a default under the facility exists  our ability to pay dividends would be limited to the amount necessary to maintain our status as a reit unless the default is a payment default or bankruptcy event in which case we would be prohibited from paying any dividends 
the facility is guaranteed by most of our wholly owned subsidiaries 
as of december   we had million outstanding on this credit facility 
the weighted average interest rate  including the interest rate swaps as of december  was 
as of december   we had a million unsecured credit facility with city national bank of florida  of which no funds had been drawn 
this facility provides security of million in outstanding letters of credit 
our revolving credit facility balances as of december  and december  consisted of the following december  december  in thousands revolving credit facilities wells fargo unsecured  wells fargo secured retired  city national bank unsecured total revolving credit facilities   as of december   the gross availability under the various credit facilities was approximately million  resulting in additional borrowing capacity of million  net of letters of credit 
our mortgage and unsecured senior notes payable balances as of december  and consisted of the following december  december  in thousands mortgage and unsecured senior notes payable fixed rate mortgage loans   unsecured senior notes payable  variable rate mortgage loans retired  unamortized premium on notes payable  total mortgage and unsecured senior notes payable   as a result of our merger with irt  we assumed irt s obligations relating to million principal amount of senior notes  bearing interest at fixed annual interest rates ranging from to and maturing between and the interest rate of one series of these senior notes is subject to a basis point increase if we do not maintain an investment grade debt rating 
these notes have also been guaranteed by most of our wholly owned subsidiaries 
each of the existing mortgage loans is secured by a mortgage on one or more of certain of our properties 
certain of the mortgage loans involving an aggregate principal balance of approximately million contain prohibitions on transfers of ownership which may have been violated by our previous issuances of common stock or in connection with past acquisitions and may be violated by transactions involving our capital stock in the future 
if a violation were established  it could serve as a basis for a lender to accelerate amounts due under the affected mortgage 
to date  no lender has notified us that it intends to accelerate its mortgage 
based on discussions with various lenders  current credit market conditions and other factors  we believe that the mortgages will not be accelerated 
accordingly  we believe that the violations of these prohibitions will not have a material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
as of december   our total debt of million  divided by our gross real estate assets of billion equals 
our debt level could subject us to various risks  including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest  and the risk that the resulting reduced financial flexibility could inhibit our ability to develop or improve our rental properties  withstand downturns in our rental income or take advantage of business opportunities 
in addition  because we currently anticipate that only a small portion of the principal of our indebtedness will be repaid prior to maturity  it is expected that it will be necessary to refinance the majority of our debt 
accordingly  there is a risk that such indebtedness will not be able to be refinanced or that the terms of any refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of our current indebtedness

environmental matters we are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations 
the operation of dry cleaning facilities at our shopping centers is the principal environmental concern 
we require that the tenants who operate these facilities do so in material compliance with current laws and regulations and we have established procedures to monitor their operations 
additionally  we use all legal means to cause tenants to remove dry cleaning plants from our shopping centers 
where available  we have applied and been accepted into state sponsored environmental programs 
we have also placed environmental insurance on specific properties with known contamination in order to mitigate our environmental risk 
we believe that the ultimate disposition of currently known environmental matters will not have a material effect on our financial position  liquidity or operations 
inflation and recession considerations most of our leases contain provisions designed to partially mitigate the adverse impact of inflation 
most of our leases require the tenant to pay its share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes and insurance  thereby reducing our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
a small portion of our leases also include clauses enabling us to receive percentage rents based on a tenant s gross sales above predetermined levels  which sales generally increase as prices rise  or escalation clauses which are typically related to increases in the consumer price index or similar inflation indices 
our financial results are affected by general economic conditions in the markets in which our properties are located 
an economic recession  or other adverse changes in general or local economic conditions  could result in the inability of some of our existing tenants to meet their lease obligations and could otherwise adversely affect our ability to attract or retain tenants 
supermarkets  drugstores and other anchor tenants that offer day to day necessities rather than luxury items anchor our existing properties 
these types of tenants  in our experience  generally maintain more consistent sales performance during periods of adverse economic conditions 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary market risk to which we have exposure is interest rate risk 
changes in interest rates can affect our net income and cash flows 
as changes in market conditions occur  interest rates can either increase or decrease and interest expense on the variable component of our debt will move in the same direction 
with respect to our mortgage and senior unsecured notes payable  changes in interest rates generally do not affect our interest expense  as these notes payable at fixed rates for extended terms with a weighted average life of years and years  respectively 
because we intend to hold our existing fixed rate notes are payable either to maturity or until the sale of the associated property  there is believed to be no interest rate market risk on our operations or our working capital position 
our primary risk is from increases in long term interest rates that may occur over a period of several years  as this may decrease the overall value of our real estate 
we estimate the fair market value of our long term  fixed rate mortgage loans using discounted cash flow analysis based on current borrowing rates for similar types of debt 
at december   the fair value of the fixed rate mortgage loans was estimated to be million compared to the carrying value amount of million  excluding the unamortized premium on notes payable 
if the weighted average interest rate on our fixed rate debt were basis points lower or higher than the current weighted average rate of  the fair market value would be million and million  respectively 
we estimate the fair market value of our senior unsecured fixed rate debt using discounted cash flow analysis based on current borrowing rates for similar types of debt 
at december   the fair value of our senior unsecured fixed rate debt was estimated to be million compared to the carrying value amount of million  excluding unamortized premium on notes payable 
if the weighted average interest rate on our fixed rate debt were basis points lower or higher than the current weighted average rate of  the fair market value would be million and million  respectively 
at december   our variable rate debt balance consisted of million of revolving credit facilities  of which million has been hedged under interest rate swaps pursuant to which we pay fixed interest rates  and million remains subject to changes in interest rates 
if the weighted average interest rate on the unhedged portion of our variable rate debt were basis points higher or lower  annual interest expense would increase or decrease by approximately  at december   the fair value of the million of variable rate debt where interest costs have been fixed under interest rate hedges was estimated to be million 
financial instruments derivatives and hedging in the normal course of business  we are exposed to the effect of interest rate changes that could affect our results of operations or cash flows 
we limit these risks by following established risk management policies and procedures  including the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage or hedge interest rate risk 
we do not enter into derivative instruments for speculative purposes 
we require that the hedging derivative instruments be effective in reducing interest rate risk exposure 
this effectiveness is essential to qualify for hedge accounting 
changes in the hedging instrument s fair value related to the effective portion of the risk being hedged are included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss 
in those cases  hedge effectiveness criteria also require that it be probable that the underlying transaction occurs 
hedges that meet these hedging criteria are formally designated as cash flow hedges at the inception of the derivative contract 
when the terms of an underlying transaction are modified  or when the underlying hedged item ceases to exist  the change in the fair value of the derivative instrument is marked to market with the change included in net income in each period until the derivative instrument matures 
additionally  any derivative instrument used for risk management that becomes ineffective is marked to market 
we do not anticipate non performance by any of our counterparties 
net interest differentials to be paid or received under a swap contract and or collar agreement are included in interest expense as incurred or earned 
interest rate hedges that are designated as cash flow hedges hedge the future cash outflows on debt 
interest rate swaps that convert variable payments to fixed payments  interest rate caps  floors  collars and forwards are cash flow hedges 
the unrealized gains or losses in the fair value of these hedges are reported on the balance sheet and included in accounts payable and accrued expenses with a corresponding adjustment to either accumulated other comprehensive income or loss  or are recognized in earnings depending on the hedging relationship 
if the hedging transaction is a cash flow hedge  then the offsetting gains or losses are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss 
over time  the unrealized gains or losses held in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss will be recognized in earnings consistent with when the hedged items are recognized in earnings 
in conjunction with our policy to reduce interest rate risk  we have entered into interest rate swaps to hedge a portion of the variability of monthly cash outflows attributable to changes in libor 
under the swaps  we receive libor based payments and pay a fixed rate 
a summary of the terms of the derivative instruments  as of december   and a reconciliation of the fair value and adjustments to accumulated other comprehensive loss in thousands are as follows hedge type cash flow description swap range of notional amounts   total  range of interest rates range of maturity dates total accumulated other comprehensive loss at december  change in fair value for the year ended december  total accumulated other comprehensive loss at december  the estimated fair value of our financial instruments has been determined by us  using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies 
however  considerable judgment is necessarily required in interpreting market data to develop the estimates of fair value 
accordingly  the estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that we could realize in a current market exchange 
the use of different market assumptions or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts 
for purposes of the securities and exchange commission s market risk disclosure requirements  we have estimated the fair value of our financial instruments at december  the fair value estimates presented herein are based on pertinent information available to management as of december  although management is not aware of any factors that would significantly affect the estimated fair value amounts as of december   future estimates of fair value and the amounts which may be paid or realized in the future may differ significantly from amounts presented 
our revolving credit facilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates
