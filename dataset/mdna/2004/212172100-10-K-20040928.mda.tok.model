item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we are a mixed model provider of primary care physician services 
through our network of medical centers and ipas located in miami dade  broward and hillsborough counties  florida  we were responsible for providing primary care medical services or overseeing the provision of primary care services by affiliated physicians to approximately  patients on a full risk basis and approximately  patients on a limited or non risk basis as of june  in fiscal  approximately of our revenue was generated by providing services to medicare eligible members under full risk agreements that require us to assume responsibility to provide and pay for all of our patients medical needs in exchange for a capitated fee  typically a percentage of the premium received by an hmo from various payor sources 
prior to their disposition in january and february  we provided home health care services to recovering  disabled  chronically ill and terminally ill patients in their homes 
in an effort to streamline and stem operating losses  effective january   we terminated the medicare and medicaid lines of business for all of the physician contracts associated with one of our ipas  which consisted of physicians at the time of termination 
additionally  in december  we implemented a plan to dispose of our home health operations 
the home health disposition occurred in three separate transactions and was concluded on february  as a result of these transactions  the operations of the terminated ipas and our home health operations are shown as discontinued operations 
in addition to terminating and disposing of unprofitable operations  we focused our attention on strengthening our financial position 
during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  we obtained an extension of the maturity date for our credit facility until march   caused the conversion of all of the outstanding principal balance of our convertible subordinated notes payable into million shares of our common stock and sold million shares of our common stock to twelve accredited investors in a private transaction 
the proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock were used to retire approximately million of long term debt  reduce the balance outstanding under the credit facility by approximately million and for general corporate purposes 
in connection with the transaction  frost nevada investments trust frost nevada  an entity controlled by dr 
phillip frost  a director and beneficial owner of approximately of our outstanding common stock as of september   converted a convertible promissory note having an outstanding principal balance and unpaid accrued interest of approximately million into  shares of common stock in accordance with the terms of that note 
as a result of these efforts and an increase in profitability in fiscal  working capital increased to million as of june   from a working capital deficiency of million as of june   and long term debt decreased to million as of june   from million as of june  
table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements and accompanying notes requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
certain of the amounts recorded on our financial statements could change materially under different  yet still reasonable  estimates and assumptions 
we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience  knowledge of current events and anticipated future events  and we continuously evaluate and update our estimates and assumptions 
however  our estimates and assumptions may ultimately prove to be incorrect or incomplete and our actual results may differ materially 
we believe the following critical accounting policies involve the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue is recorded in the period services are rendered as determined by the respective contract 
under our full risk contracts with hmos  we receive a percentage of premium or other capitated fee for each patient that chooses one of our physicians as their primary care physician and we assume responsibility for the cost of all medical services  even those we do not provide directly 
to the extent that patients require more frequent or expensive care  our revenue under a contract may be insufficient to cover the costs of care provided 
when it is probable that expected future health care costs and maintenance costs under a contract or group of existing contracts will exceed anticipated capitated revenue on those contracts  we recognize losses on our prepaid health care services with hmos 
no contracts were considered loss contracts at june   because we have the right to terminate unprofitable physicians and close unprofitable centers under our managed care contracts 
under our limited risk and no risk contracts with hmos  we receive a management fee based on the number of patients for which we are providing services on a monthly basis 
the management fee is recorded as revenue in the period in which services are provided as determined by the respective contract 
medical claims expense recognition the cost of health care services provided or contracted for is accrued in the period in which the services are provided and includes an estimate of the related liability for medical claims incurred but not yet reported  or ibnr 
estimating ibnr involves a significant amount of judgment and represents a material portion of our medical claims liability which is presented in the balance sheet net of amounts due from hmos 
changes in this estimate can materially effect  either favorably or unfavorably  our results from operations and overall financial position 
we develop our estimate of ibnr primarily based on historical claims incurred per member per month 
we adjust our estimate if we have unusually high or low inpatient utilization and if benefit changes provided under the hmo plans are expected to significantly increase or reduce our claims exposure 
we also adjust our estimate for differences between the estimated claims expense recorded in prior months to actual claims expense as claims are paid by the hmo and reported to us 
to further corroborate our estimate of medical claims  an independent actuarial calculation is performed for us on a quarterly basis 
this independent actuarial calculation indicates that ibnr as of june  was between approximately million and million 
as of june   we had recorded a liability of approximately million for ibnr based on our monthly calculation process 
as the amount recorded was within the actuarial range  no further analysis was performed 
consideration of impairment related to goodwill and other intangible assets our balance sheet includes intangible assets  including goodwill and other separately identifiable intangible assets  which represented approximately of our total assets at june  under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are no longer amortized  but are reviewed for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if certain indicators of permanent impairment arise 
intangible assets with definite useful lives are amortized over their respective useful lives to their estimated residual values and also reviewed for impairment annually  or more frequently if certain indicators of permanent impairment arise 
indicators of a permanent impairment include  among other things  a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate  the loss of a key hmo contract  an 
table of contents adverse action by a regulator  unanticipated competition  the loss of key personnel or allocation of goodwill to a portion of business that is to be sold 
because we operate in a single segment of business  that of managing the provision of outpatient health care and health care related services in the state of florida  management has determined that we have a single reporting unit and we perform our impairment test for goodwill on an enterprise level 
in performing the impairment test  we compare our fair value  as determined by the current market value of our common stock  to the current carrying value of the total net assets  including goodwill and intangible assets 
we completed our annual impairment test on may   and determined that no impairment existed 
accordingly  no impairment charges were required at june  should we determine that an indicator of impairment has occurred  such as those noted above  we would be required to perform an additional impairment test 
depending on the market value of our common stock at the time that an impairment test is required  there is a risk that a portion of our intangible assets would be considered impaired and must be written off during that period 
results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
the following tables set forth  for the periods indicated  selected operating data as a percentage of total revenue 
year ended june  revenue medical services revenue  net management fee revenue other income total revenue operating expenses medical services medical claims other direct costs total medical services administrative payroll and employee benefits general and administrative gain on extinguishment of debt total operating expenses income from operations other income expense interest expense medicare settlement related to terminated operations income loss from continuing operations income loss from discontinued operations home health operations terminated ipas total loss from discontinued operations net income loss comparison of fiscal year ended june   to fiscal year ended june  revenue from continuing operations medical services revenue increased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the most significant component of our medical services revenue is the revenue we generated from medicare patients under full risk contracts 
in fiscal  approximately of our medical service revenue was generated by medicare eligible patients under full risk contracts 
revenue generated by our medicare full risk contracts increased approximately on a per patient per month basis which was partially offset by a decrease of approximately in medicare patients months 
the increase in medicare revenue is primarily due to higher per patient per month premiums resulting from the medicare modernization act and the increased phase in of the medicare risk 
table of contents adjustment program  both of which became effective in january as of june   patients under full risk contracts decreased to approximately  from approximately  as of june   while patients under limited or non risk contracts increased to approximately  as of june   from approximately  as of june  management fee revenue of million during fiscal related to revenue generated under our limited risk and non risk contracts with hmos 
the management fee revenue primarily relates to the humana pgp agreement that we executed in april no revenue was generated under such agreements during fiscal revenue from continuing operations generated by our managed care entities under contracts with humana accounted for and of our medical services revenue for fiscal and  respectively 
revenue from continuing operations generated by our managed care entities under contracts with vista accounted for and of our medical services revenue for fiscal and  respectively 
expenses from continuing operations medical services expenses are comprised of medical claims expense and other direct costs related to the provision of medical services to our patients 
medical claims expense includes the costs of medical services provided to our patients by providers other than us but for which we are financially responsible under the terms of our full risk contracts with hmos 
other direct costs include the salaries  taxes and benefits of our health professionals providing primary care services  medical malpractice insurance costs  capitation payments to our ipa physicians and other costs related to the provision of medical services to our patients 
medical services expenses for fiscal increased by million  or  to million from million for fiscal as a percentage of total revenue  medical services expenses decreased to for fiscal as compared to for fiscal the increase in medical services expenses was primarily due to an increase in medical claims expense of million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the increase in medical claims expense was primarily due to higher stop loss insurance costs and an increase in utilization of health care services 
however  the increase in medical services revenue attributable to the higher per patient per month premiums resulting from the medicare modernization act and the increased phase in of the medicare risk adjustment more than offset the increase in claims expense for fiscal as a result  notwithstanding the increase in our medical claims expense  our claims loss ratio medical claims expense as a percentage of medical services revenue decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal in response to the medicare modernization act  certain benefits offered to medicare patients were enhanced by the hmos 
we anticipate that these benefit changes will result in an increase in our medical claims expense and may result in an increase in our claims loss ratio in future periods 
we cannot quantify what impact  if any  these developments may have on our results of operations in future periods 
however  our claims loss ratio fluctuates from period to period based upon variations in medical utilization  medical costs and premiums revenues 
other direct costs increased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal as a percentage of total revenue  other direct costs increased to for fiscal from for fiscal the increase in other direct costs was primarily due to an increase in payroll expense for physicians and medical support personnel at our medical centers and an increase in medical malpractice insurance costs 
administrative payroll and employee benefits for fiscal and remained relatively constant at million and million  respectively  or and  respectively  of total revenue 
general and administrative expenses decreased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal as a percentage of total revenue  general and administrative expenses decreased to for fiscal as compared to for fiscal the decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to the settlement of two lawsuits in fiscal resulting in a reduction in the accrual for legal claims of million  which was partially offset by separation costs of million incurred in fiscal in connection with the resignation of our former president 
the million gain on extinguishment of debt recognized during fiscal related to the million contract modification note with humana that was cancelled in april simultaneously with the note cancellation  we executed the humana pgp agreement and assumed management responsibilities on a non risk basis for certain of humana s members 
the humana pgp agreement expires in april and contained a provision for liquidated damages in the amount of million  which can be asserted by humana under certain circumstances 
because there were contingent circumstances under which any future payments of liquidated damages to humana could equal the amount of debt forgiven  the million gain that we otherwise would have recognized from the extinguishment of the debt in the fourth quarter of fiscal  was deferred 
to the extent that humana reduces the maximum amount of liquidated damages  we will recognize a portion of the deferred gain in a manner consistent with the reduction in the maximum amount of liquidated damages 
in may  humana notified us that the maximum amount of liquidated damages 
table of contents had been reduced to million 
accordingly  we recognized million of the deferred gain on extinguishment of debt during fiscal no similar transaction occurred during fiscal income from operations income from operations for fiscal increased by million to million  or of total revenue  from million  or of total revenue  for fiscal medicare settlement related to terminated operations during fiscal  we recorded other income of million relating to the settlement of an alleged medicare obligation 
the alleged obligation related to rehabilitation clinics that were previously operated by one of our former subsidiaries and were sold in cms had alleged that medicare overpayments were made relating to services rendered by these clinics and other related clinics during a period in which the clinics were operated by entities other than us 
in an effort to resolve the matter with cms and avoid aggressive collection efforts that could have disrupted our business  in we entered into a memorandum of understanding under which we began making payments to resolve the alleged liability while retaining the right to dispute the alleged overpayments 
we requested that cms reconsider the alleged liability  and in october we were notified that the liability had been reduced from the originally asserted amount of million to million 
loss from discontinued operations home health operations our home health operations contributed million and million in revenue and generated an operating loss of million which included charges in connection with the disposition of million and million during fiscal and  respectively 
income from discontinued operations terminated ipas the ipas we terminated effective january  contributed million in medical services revenue and generated operating income of  during fiscal the terminated ipas did not contribute any revenue but generated operating income of  during fiscal income generated by the terminated ipas during fiscal resulted from a settlement with the hmo which eliminated all amounts due to and amounts due from the hmo incurred prior to the termination of the contracts on january  taxes no provision for income taxes was recorded in fiscal and due primarily to the utilization of prior year net operating loss carryforwards 
we periodically perform an analysis of the realizability of our deferred tax assets based on our assessment of current and expected operating results 
as of june   we determined that a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of million was necessary resulting in a decrease in the valuation allowance of million in fiscal the valuation allowance reduction was due to the utilization of deferred tax assets during fiscal to offset income tax liabilities that were generated from current operations 
net income net income for fiscal increased by million to million from million for fiscal comparison of fiscal year ended june  to fiscal year ended june  revenue from continuing operations medical services revenue increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the increase was primarily the result of increases in the number of medicare patients from whom we received percentage of premium revenue and increases in the premium revenue per patient 
additionally  in september  we were notified by our medicare fiscal intermediary that they had completed the reopening of a rms cost report which resulted in an alleged liability of approximately  being reduced to approximately  as a result  in the fourth quarter of fiscal we recorded an adjustment of approximately  as a medicare cost report settlement  which was included in net medical services revenue

taxes no provision or benefit for income taxes was recorded in fiscal and as of june   we determined that our tax assets could not be recognized as it is more likely than not that they will not be realized 
as of june   we determined that a valuation allowance of million was necessary resulting in a decrease in the valuation allowance of million in fiscal 
table of contents the valuation allowance reduction was due to the utilization of deferred tax assets during fiscal to offset income tax liabilities that were generated from current operations 
net income loss net income for fiscal was  compared to a net loss of million for fiscal liquidity and capital resources at june   working capital was million  an increase of million from a working capital deficit of million at june  the increase in working capital for fiscal was primarily due to an increase in net income of million 
cash and cash equivalents were million at june   compared to million at june  net cash of million was provided by operating activities from continuing operations during fiscal compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal the decrease of million in cash provided by operating activities during fiscal was primarily due to an increase of million in amounts due from hmos  a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of million  income recognized of million in connection with the medicare settlement related to terminated operations  and a gain of million on the early extinguishment of debt  which taken together  more than offset our million increase in income from continuing operations 
the increase of million in cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations during fiscal was primarily due to an increase in income from continuing operations of million  a decrease of million in amounts due from hmos  a decrease of million in other receivables  a decrease of million in depreciation and amortization expense  and a decrease of million in amounts due to medicare 
in april  we executed the humana pgp agreement  as described above  under which we assumed certain management responsibilities on a non risk basis for certain of humana s medicare  commercial and medicaid members assigned to selected primary care physicians in miami dade and broward counties 
revenue from this contract consists of a monthly management fee intended to cover our costs for providing these services 
simultaneously with the execution of the humana pgp agreement  we restructured the terms of a million contract modification note with humana 
in november and again in may  we were notified that humana had reduced the maximum amount of liquidated damages to million and million  respectively 
accordingly  we recognized million and million  respectively  of the deferred gain on extinguishment of debt in the second and fourth quarters of fiscal effective january   we terminated all of our ipa relationships associated with one hmo and in december  we implemented a plan to dispose of our home health operations as described above 
as a result  the operations of the terminated ipas and home health operations are shown as discontinued operations 
the terminated ipas contributed million and million of medical services revenue and generated income of  and million of income in fiscal and  respectively 
the home health operations contributed million and million in revenue and generated losses of million which includes charges in connection with the disposition of million and million during fiscal and  respectively 
in fiscal  our claims loss ratio improved due in part to an increase in revenue resulting from the medicare modernization act and the increased phase in of the medicare risk adjustment 
effective march   certain benefits offered to medicare members were enhanced by the hmos for whom we treat patients in response to the medicare modernization act 
we anticipate that these benefit changes will result in an increase in our medical claims expense and may result in an increase in our claims loss ratio in future periods  however  we cannot predict what future impact  if any  these developments may have on our results of operations or cash flows from operations 
net cash of million was used for investing activities from continuing operations in fiscal compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal net cash used for investing activities primarily related to the purchase of equipment 
net cash of million was used in financing activities from continuing operations compared to net cash used of million in fiscal and net cash provided by financing activities of million in fiscal the decrease in cash used in financing activities of million in fiscal was primarily due to an increase in proceeds of million from the issuance of stock and million from the exercise of stock options that were partially offset by an increase of million in repayments to medicare and an increase of million in payments of the credit facility
