item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and spectralink s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
as referenced in the first paragraph of part i  this report contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
spectralink s actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in such forward looking statements 
for a more complete understanding of our financial condition and results of operations  and some of the risks and trends that could affect future results  see other factors affecting operating results  liquidity and capital resources in this report s item business description and overview spectralink commenced operations in april to design  manufacture and sell unlicensed wireless telephone communication systems for businesses 
spectralink s product portfolio consists of two product categories differentiated by the wireless technology implemented link wts and netlink wireless telephones 
link wts targets organizations that require a dedicated wireless voice solution for their on premises mobile workforce 
netlink wireless telephones target organizations that want both a wireless voice and wireless data solution on a single network 
because of the recent advances in wireless local area network lan technology  spectralink s future focus will be on its existing netlink products as well as products it is currently developing that operate on a wireless lan 
spectralink s primary sales efforts currently focus on home improvement  grocery and other retail store chains  hospitals  nursing homes  distribution centers  manufacturing and service facilities  corporate offices  government and education facilities 
for fiscal year  spectralink s earnings per diluted share were on net income of million and revenue of million 
this represents growth in annual net income  and over growth in annual revenue  compared to fiscal year the primary driver of revenue growth in was the increased sales of netlink wireless telephones 
sales of this product line grew more than  from to  which was a increase over netlink sales 
spectralink introduced new netlink products in all of these products are based on the global standard and are expected by spectralink to be a foundation for targeted future growth 
spectralink expects that sales of netlink wireless telephones will constitute a majority of its product sales in in fiscal year  sales through spectralink s distributors accounted for of total product sales 
the vast majority of sales in fiscal year occurred in north america 
international sales are expected to grow as a percentage of total revenue with the introduction of spectralink products that utilize voip that are offered at a much reduced price to the customer as compared to its past products 
the i netlink handset  which is targeted at vertical markets that need extensive features and durability  was enhanced with a push to talk feature allowing broadcast messaging where needed 
the new e netlink handset  which is a smaller  lighter option than previously offered products  was designed to expand spectralink s presence into the small to medium enterprise markets  as well as international markets 
with its dramatically reduced price  this handset is intended to capitalize on the price elasticity of demand and drive overall product volume 
the other main product announced in was the wireless deskset 
this product will appeal to the growing interest in totally wireless office facilities 
in  spectralink used  of its cash to repurchase outstanding common stock and to pay a cash dividend to its stockholders 
spectralink s ongoing success is dependent upon its ability to build solid partnerships and relationships 
to that end  an original equipment manufacturer program management office was created in during the year  spectralink announced agreements with nec  inter tel and sbc 
these relationships complement the arrangement with avaya that was initiated in the oem program office will continue to seek relationships that will not only distribute spectralink products but also 
table of contents co brand and private label these products 
the goal of this strategy is to provide greater exposure to spectralink s products through the reach these partners have with their customers 
these relationships also help to establish an international presence for spectralink products 
spectralink expects that its gross margin in will range between and 
spectralink realizes relatively lower margins on products sold through oem relationships 
therefore  if spectralink succeeds in expanding these relationships  it will experience downward pressure on gross margins 
another factor that will directly affect gross margins is product mix 
the netlink e handset carries a much lower margin than any other spectralink product 
as a result  if spectralink succeeds in penetrating new enterprise markets  and sales of the netlink e handset increase as a result  gross margins will decline 
these two factors may potentially push gross margins below the forecast range of to

liquidity and capital resources year ended year ended december  december  cash from operating activities cash used in investing activities cash used in financing activities spectralink has funded its operations since inception with cash provided by operations  supplemented by equity financing and leases on capital equipment 
as of december   spectralink had  of cash and cash equivalents 
during the fourth quarter of  spectralink paid its first quarterly cash dividend to holders of common stock and intends to use some of its cash provided by operations to pay future quarterly dividends during a yet to be determined period of time as determined by the board of directors 
during  spectralink generated cash from operations of  consisting principally of net income of  adjustments for depreciation and amortization  income tax benefit from exercises of stock options  and provision for excess and obsolete inventory that reconcile net income to cash  as well as increases in accounts payable  accrued liabilities  and deferred revenue and was offset by increases in trade accounts receivable  inventory  income taxes receivable  and other assets 
in  investing activities used cash of  for purchases of property and equipment primarily related to the implementation of an erp system and purchases of manufacturing tooling and molds 
spectralink used  of cash in financing activities during  which was a direct result of purchases of  shares of the outstanding common stock now classified as treasury stock at a cost of  the issuance and payment of a cash dividend of  and payments on an obligation of  these cash outflows were offset by proceeds of  received from common stock option exercises and issuances of common stock through the employee stock purchase plan 

table of contents as of december   spectralink had no debt outstanding  and there were no off balance sheet arrangements  unconsolidated subsidiaries  commitments or guarantees  except as disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
stockholders equity at december  was  which represented of total assets 
as of december   spectralink had working capital of  compared to  at december  the increase in working capital of  occurred primarily from cash flows from operations and proceeds from common stock option exercises and stock issuances  offset by the purchase of capital assets  the repurchase of common stock and the cash dividend paid 
as of december   spectralink s current ratio ratio of current assets to current liabilities was  compared with a current ratio of as of december  spectralink believes that its current cash  cash equivalents and cash generated from operations will be sufficient  based on spectralink s presently anticipated needs to fund necessary capital expenditures  to provide adequate working capital  pay dividends and to finance its expansion for the foreseeable future next months 
there can be no assurance  however  that spectralink will not require additional financing 
there can be no assurance that any additional financing will be available to spectralink on acceptable terms  or at all  when required by spectralink 
if additional funds were to be raised through the sale of equity securities  additional dilution to the existing stockholders would be likely to result 
aggregate contractual obligations and commercial commitments spectralink incurs various contractual obligations and commercial commitments in its normal course of business 
such obligations and commitments consist primarily of the following lease commitments 
spectralink leases its facilities under noncancelable operating lease arrangements that expire at various dates through spectralink has other obligations for office equipment that expire at various dates through purchase commitments 
spectralink incurs various purchase obligations with vendors and suppliers for the purchase of inventory  as well as goods and services  in the normal course of business 
these obligations are generally evidenced by purchase orders with delivery dates from six to twelve months from the purchase date  and in certain cases  purchase orders that contain non cancelable non returnable terms and conditions associated with these purchase arrangements 
spectralink is committed to accept delivery of such materials pursuant to such purchase orders subject to various contract provisions which allow spectralink to delay receipt of such orders 
such orders may or may not include cancellation costs payable by spectralink 
in the past  spectralink has been required to take delivery of materials from its suppliers that were in excess of demand requirements and spectralink has previously recognized charges and expenses related to such excess material  related primarily to engineering changes 
if spectralink is not able to adequately manage its supply chain and adjust such commitments for changes in demand  spectralink may incur additional inventory expenses related to excess and obsolete inventory 
such expenses could have a material adverse effect on spectralink s business  financial condition and results of operations 
indemnifications 
spectralink provides indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of its products 
spectralink evaluates estimated losses for such indemnifications under sfas  accounting for contingencies  as interpreted by fasb interpretation  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
spectralink considers such factors as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss 
to date  spectralink has not encountered material costs as a result of such obligations and has not accrued any liabilities related to such indemnifications in spectralink s financial statements 
as of december   expected future cash payments related to contractual obligations and commercial commitments were as follows thereafter total operating leases     purchase commitments  other obligations     total contractual obligations and commercial commitments  
table of contents spectralink believes its existing cash balances and funds expected to be generated from future operations will be sufficient to satisfy these contractual obligations and commercial commitments and that the ultimate payments associated with these commitments will not have a material adverse effect on spectralink s liquidity position 
critical accounting policies and estimates spectralink has identified the most critical accounting principles upon which its financial status depends 
spectralink determined the critical accounting principles by considering accounting policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments 
below is a summary of spectralink s most critical accounting policies 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with spectralink s consolidated financial statements and related notes beginning on page of this report 
spectralink s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon spectralink s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires spectralink to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
spectralink evaluates its estimates  on an on going basis  including those related to revenue recognition  receivables  product warranty obligations  inventories and income taxes 
spectralink bases estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
spectralink considers an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires spectralink to make assumptions about matters that were uncertain at the time of making the estimate  and changes in the estimate or assumptions in the estimate could have a material impact on spectralink s financial condition or results of operations 
the following table presents information about the nature and rationale for spectralink s critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements financial statement critical estimate nature of estimates assumptions approaches caption s item required used key factors sales and deferred revenue collectibility spectralink is required to estimate the collectibility of invoiced amounts in accordance with the ability of the customer to pay 
spectralink determines whether collectibility is reasonably assured based on possible credit deterioration  the customer s ability to sell through the products purchased and the relationship spectralink has with its customer 
spectralink s revenue recognition policy is based on complex and dynamic rules established by the securities and exchange commission and other governing bodies 
these rules require spectralink to make judgments with regard to post delivery obligations 
when post delivery obligations exist  revenue is deferred until such obligations are fulfilled

tax law changes variances in future projected profitability  including by taxing entity in addition  there are other items within spectralink s financial statements that require estimation  but are not as critical as those discussed above 
revisions to any of the discussed estimates  or other non critical items  could have a significant effect on spectralink s consolidated financial statements 

table of contents recently issued accounting pronouncements spectralink was required to adopt eitf issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables for the quarter ended september  this issue addresses when and  if so  how an arrangement involving multiple deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting and how the arrangement consideration should be measured and allocated to the separate units of accounting in the arrangement 
the adoption of this eitf did not have an effect on the consolidated results of operations or financial position of spectralink 
in december  the staff of the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition  which supersedes sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab s primary purpose is to rescind accounting guidance contained in sab related to multiple element arrangements  superseded as a result of the issuance of eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
additionally  sab rescinds the sec s revenue recognition in financial statements frequently asked questions and answers the faq issued with sab that had been codified in sab topic  revenue recognition 
selected portions of the faq have been incorporated into sab while the wording of sab has changed to reflect the issuance of eitf  the revenue recognition principles of sab remain largely unchanged by the issuance of sab the adoption of sab in december did not have an effect on the consolidated results of operations or financial position of spectralink 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the financial position  results of operations or cash flows of spectralink due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices and rates 
spectralink is exposed to market risk due to changes in united states interest rates 
these exposures are directly related to spectralink s normal operating and funding activities 
as of december   spectralink has not used derivative instruments or engaged in hedging activities  and is not currently impacted significantly by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rate risk as part of spectralink s cash management strategy  at december   spectralink had cash and cash equivalents of approximately  mainly in the form of bank demand deposits and money markets 
spectralink has completed a market risk sensitivity analysis of these cash and cash equivalents based on an assumed point increase in interest rates 
if market rates had increased or decreased point during the year ended december   spectralink s interest income would have increased or decreased by approximately  forward looking statement factors the factors discussed below are cautionary statements that identify important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by the forward looking statements contained in this report 
for more information regarding the forward looking statements contained in this report  see the introductory paragraph to part i of this report 
if spectralink is unable to fulfill quarter end customer orders  then spectralink could lose revenue and customers 
the volume of customer orders for spectralink s products typically increases significantly at the end of each quarter 
spectralink faces significant challenges in meeting this demand 
it is difficult to ensure that spectralink has the resources available to meet any such increase in order volume since it is very difficult to predict what the level of demand will be 
spectralink may not have the personnel and or systems necessary to fulfill the large order volume or the ability to upgrade and develop its systems and infrastructure to meet an increased order volume 
if spectralink is unable to meet demand from its customer for its products in a cost effective manner  then spectralink might lose revenue and customers or incur increased operating costs  either of which would harm spectralink s business 
many of the orders for spectralink s products are realized at the end of the quarter  which makes it difficult to estimate or adjust spectralink s operating activities quickly in response to an unexpected increase or decrease in customer demand 
due to the timing of orders from customers  spectralink has often recognized a substantial portion of its revenue in the last month of a quarter 
as a result  minor fluctuations in the timing of orders and the shipment of products may  in the future  cause operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
the demand for spectralink s products depends upon many factors and is difficult to 
table of contents forecast 
significant unanticipated fluctuations in demand could cause problems in spectralink s operations 
the lead time required to assemble spectralink s systems is often longer than the lead time spectralink s customers provide to spectralink for delivery of their product requirements 
therefore  spectralink often must place orders in advance of expected purchase orders from spectralink s customers 
as a result  spectralink has only a limited ability to react to fluctuations in demand for its products  which could cause it to have either too much or too little inventory of a particular product 
further  the business relationship which spectralink has with offshore group to use a mexico facility to assemble spectralink s products may not be able to provide product in a timely manner 
additionally  once spectralink receives an order  it requires sufficient time to complete the configuration of its product to the phone systems of the customer 
spectralink s inability to satisfy customer demand in a timely manner would lead to lost sales and impede spectralink s ability to increase its revenue 
conversely  a large portion of spectralink s expenses  including rent and salaries  is fixed and difficult to reduce 
spectralink s expenses are based in part on expectations for its revenue 
if spectralink s revenue does not meet its expectations  the adverse effect of the revenue shortfall upon spectralink s operating results may be acute in light of the fixed nature of its expenses 
it is possible that due to fluctuations in revenue  spectralink s operating results could be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors 
for instance  spectralink s stock price declined substantially after its preliminary announcement of its fourth quarter financial results reported in january in such an event  or in the event that adverse market conditions prevail or are perceived to prevail either generally or with respect to spectralink s business  the price of spectralink s common stock would likely decline further 
spectralink s reliance on sole or limited sources of supply for many components and equipment used in its manufacturing process 
spectralink relies on sole or limited sources of supply for many components and equipment used in its manufacturing process 
the delay  inability  or refusal of any of these suppliers to ship these components or equipment could interrupt spectralink s manufacturing process and ability to manufacture products in a timely manner to meet customer demand 
the limited number of sources for many of these components may also prevent spectralink from decreasing its reliance on certain suppliers and finding other sources at competitive prices 
unforeseen price increases by any of the sole or limited source suppliers could negatively impact product margins and the financial performance of spectralink 
because many of spectralink s current and planned products are or will be highly complex  they may contain defects or errors that are detectable only after deployment in complex networks and which  if detected  could have a negative effect on spectralink s business  operating results or financial condition 
many of spectralink s complex products can only be fully tested when deployed in commercial networks 
as a result  end users may discover defects or errors or experience breakdowns in their networks after the products have been deployed 
if any of these products contains defects  or has reliability  quality or compatibility problems  spectralink s reputation might be damaged significantly and customers might be reluctant to buy spectralink products 
these defects could interrupt or delay sales 
spectralink may have to invest significant capital and other resources to correct these problems 
if spectralink fails to provide solutions to the problems  it will also incur product recall  repair  warranty or replacement costs 
these problems might also result in claims against spectralink by its customer or others 
in addition  the occurrence of any defects or errors in these products  could result in failure to achieve market acceptance and loss of market share  cancellation of orders  difficulty in collecting accounts receivable  increased service and warranty costs in excess of spectralink s estimates  diversion of resources  and  increased insurance costs and other losses to spectralink s business or to end users 
if spectralink experiences warranty failure that indicates either manufacturing or design deficiencies  spectralink may be required to recall units in the field and or stop producing and shipping such products until the deficiency is identified and corrected 
in the event of such warranty failures  spectralink s business could be adversely affected resulting in reduced revenue  increased costs and decreased customer satisfaction 
end users have discovered errors in spectralink s products in the past and may discover errors in spectralink s products in the future 
in addition  if spectralink s costs of remediating problems experienced by spectralink s customers exceed spectralink s warranty reserves  these costs may adversely affect spectralink s operating results 
consequently  spectralink s warranty failure could have a material adverse impact on spectralink s operations and financial results 
spectralink s ability to attract and retain personnel  including key technical and management personnel 
much of the future success of spectralink depends on the continued service and availability of skilled personnel  including technical  marketing and staff positions 
experienced personnel in the information technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense 
there can be no assurance that spectralink will be able to successfully retain and attract the key personnel it needs 
many of spectralink s 
table of contents key personnel receive a total compensation package that includes stock options and other equity awards 
new regulations  volatility in the stock market and other factors could diminish the value of spectralink s equity awards  putting spectralink at a competitive disadvantage or forcing spectralink to use more cash compensation 
the risk of business interruption arising from spectralink s dependence on its manufacturing facility located in boulder  colorado  and the business relationship spectralink has with offshore group to use a facility in empalme  sonora  mexico which provides assembly services 
spectralink is highly dependent on its boulder  colorado manufacturing facility  which is home to the majority of spectralink s manufacturing operations 
spectralink is also highly dependent upon its business relationship with offshore group to provide management services and a facility located in empalme  sonora  mexico which assembles spectralink s products 
any event that may disrupt or indefinitely discontinue either of the facilities capacity to manufacture  assemble and repair spectralink s products could greatly impair spectralink s ability to generate revenues  fulfill orders and attain financial goals 
for instance  spectralink may experience delays in the receipt of assembled product from the facility in mexico should the border between the us and mexico close 
spectralink s ability to respond to rapid technological changes within the on premises wireless telephone industry 
the wireless communications industry is characterized by rapid technological change  short product life cycles  and evolving industry standards 
to remain competitive  spectralink must develop or gain access to new technologies in order to increase product performance and function  reduce product size  and maintain cost effectiveness  develop new products for existing and emerging wireless communications markets  and introduce such products in a timely manner  implement emerging wireless standards quickly enough to satisfy market demands and without significant product redesign  develop or obtain access to advanced wireless networking capabilities as they become available  and design  develop and introduce competitive new products on a timely basis 
due to the competitive nature of spectralink s business  any failure by spectralink to meet these challenges could materially and adversely affect spectralink s business  reputation  and operating results 
potential fluctuations in spectralink s future revenues  gross margins and operating results 
spectralink has experienced  and may in the future continue to experience  significant quarterly fluctuations in revenue  gross margins and operating results due to numerous factors  some of which are outside spectralink s control 
among other things  these factors include changes in customer  geographic or product mix  including mix of configurations within each product group  fluctuating market demand for  and declines in the average selling prices of  spectralink s products  the timing of and delay of significant orders from customers  seasonality in demand within spectralink s various sectors  increases in material or labor costs  excess inventory  obsolescence charges  changes in shipment volume  loss of cost savings due to changes in component pricing or charges incurred due to inventory holding periods if parts ordering does not correctly anticipate product demand  increases in price competition  changes in distribution channels  increases in warranty costs  and introducing of new products and costs of entering new markets 
for example  historically spectralink has not operated with a significant order backlog and a substantial portion of spectralink s revenue in any quarter has been derived from orders booked and shipped in that quarter 
accordingly  spectralink s revenue expectations are based almost entirely on its internal estimates of future demand and not on firm customer orders 
planned expense levels are relatively fixed in the short term and are based in large part on these estimates  and if orders and revenue do not meet expectations  spectralink s revenues  gross margins and operating results could be materially adversely affected 

table of contents the continuing uncertainty about economic prospects in some sectors of our target customer market  adversely impacts their information technology spending and spectralink s business 
spectralink s business has been adversely impacted by the continuing uncertainty about general economic prospects in some sectors of our target customer market within the united states and worldwide  because this uncertainty has resulted in a decline in  or a failure to increase  their information technology spending 
consumers of information technology in some of these sectors continue to defer  and in some cases cancel  their purchase decisions 
spectralink s operating results have been adversely affected as a result 
spectralink expects the economic uncertainty to continue to adversely impact its business and operating results for at least the next few quarters and perhaps significantly longer 
the adverse impacts from economic uncertainty include longer sales cycles  lower average selling prices  fewer large orders from a single customer and reduced revenues 
changes in rules and regulations of the fcc and other regulatory agencies 
the wireless communications industry  regulated by the federal communications commission fcc in the united states and similar government agencies in other countries  is subject to changing political  economic  and regulatory influences 
regulatory changes  including changes in the allocation of available frequency spectrum  could significantly impact spectralink s operations in the united states and internationally 
the ability of spectralink and its current and new distributors and resellers to develop and execute effective marketing and sales strategies 
spectralink offers its products directly and indirectly through a variety of third party business partners  including distributors and resellers 
changes in the financial or business condition of these distributors and resellers  in addition to the ability to develop and execute effective marketing and sales strategies  could subject spectralink to lost sales and affect its ability to bring its products to market 
for instance  spectralink experienced a decrease in sales by distributors during the second quarter of when those distributors downsized their businesses in reaction to the economic slowdown and  as a result  had fewer sales representatives marketing spectralink products 
spectralink s revenue and earnings are highly seasonal 
seasonality and other factors cause significant quarterly fluctuations in spectralink s revenue and net income 
spectralink s business is highly seasonal 
this causes significant quarterly fluctuations in spectralink s financial results 
revenue and operating results are usually strongest during the second and fourth fiscal quarters 
a lower than anticipated rate of acceptance of domestic and international markets using the b standard 
spectralink s netlink wireless telephones are compatible with the ieee b standard for use on b compliant wireless lans 
consequently  demand for netlink wireless telephones depends upon the acceptance of markets utilizing b compliant networks 
this depends in part upon the initial adoption of the b standard in international markets  as well as enhancements to that standard in the us and foreign markets where the standard has already been adopted 
additionally  the acceptance of b compliant networks may move more slowly  if at all  if competing wireless networks are established and utilized 
additionally  the deployment of wireless voice and data systems has been inhibited by concerns about the potential of unauthorized access to data and communications transmitted over or accessible through a wireless system 
potential customers may choose not to purchase spectralink products until wireless systems are developed which provide for greater security 
further  spectralink s products may not be compatible with secure wireless systems that may be developed in the future 
if markets utilizing b compliant networks do not grow as spectralink anticipates  spectralink s growth would be impeded and it would not be able to factor the related revenues into its growth in the future 
the market for on premises wireless telephone systems may fail to grow or to grow as quickly as spectralink anticipates 
spectralink derives its revenue principally from the sale of wireless  on premises telephone systems and related installation and other services relating to those systems 
therefore  spectralink s future operating results depend on the demand for those types of services 
if this market does not grow or grow quickly  spectralink s future results of operations would be significantly harmed 
spectralink s reliance on a limited number of significant customers 
a portion of spectralink s revenue has been derived from a limited number of customers 
sales to one customer represented approximately of spectralink s revenue during the twelve months ended december  spectralink also has experienced quarter to quarter variability in sales to each of its major customers and expects this pattern to continue in the future 

table of contents spectralink might not be able to execute on its business plan if it loses key management or technical personnel  on whose knowledge  leadership and technical expertise it relies  or if new members of spectralink s management team fail to work effectively together 
spectralink s success depends heavily upon the contributions of its key management and technical personnel  whose knowledge  leadership and technical expertise would be difficult to replace 
many of these individuals have been with spectralink for several years and have developed specialized knowledge and skills relating to its technology and business 
others have been promoted within  or have newly joined  senior management roles only recently 
for example  in september  john elms  spectralink s vice president of operations  was promoted to president and chief executive officer  while bruce holland  the former president and chief executive officer  continued with spectralink as chairman of the board until he resigned from the board in march additionally  in october  spectralink hired john kelley as vice president of operations 
in february  michael cronin  spectralink s vice president of sales and marketing determined to resign his positions of vice president of sales and marketing and corporate officer effective april   although he has agreed to remain an employee of spectralink to assist with the transition through june  spectralink s success depends in part upon the ability of new executives to work effectively together and with the rest of spectralink s employees to continue to develop its technology and manage the operation and growth of spectralink s business 
all of spectralink s executive officers and key personnel are employees at will 
spectralink has no employment contracts and does not maintain key person insurance on any of its personnel 
spectralink might not be able to execute on its business plan if it were to lose the services of any of its key personnel 
if any of these individuals were to leave spectralink unexpectedly  spectralink could face substantial difficulty in hiring qualified successors and could experience a loss in productivity while any such successor develops the necessary training and experience 
spectralink s reliance on its b technology partners to continue to provide the wireless local area network for spectralink s netlink product  and to provide access points which support spectralink voice priority 
in the absences of a wireless voice prioritization standard  spectralink relies on b technology partners  such as proxim  symbol technologies  and cisco systems to continue to provide wireless local area network support for spectralink s netlink product and to provide access points that support spectralink voice priority 
if any of spectralink s technology partners fails to provide voice prioritization support for spectralink s products  the market opportunity for netlink products would be reduced and spectralink s future results of operations would be materially harmed until spectralink finds new b technology partners or voice prioritization standards are adopted 
the ability of spectralink to develop and introduce new products and transition existing products 
spectralink s development efforts may not lead to the successful introduction of new or improved products 
spectralink may encounter delays in deploying new or improved products 
for instance  spectralink s new products may not properly function with its customers existing telephone systems or spectralink s new products may contain defects or bugs 
these incompatibilities  defects or bugs may not be detected until spectralink s customers begin to install the products or thereafter 
spectralink may need to modify the design of its new or improved products if they have incompatibilities  defects or bugs  which could result in significant expenditures by spectralink as it seeks to remedy the problems  delays in the purchase of the products or cancelled orders 
spectralink may also encounter delays in the manufacturing and production of the new products 
additionally  the new products may not be commercially successful 
demand for existing products may decrease upon the announcement of new or improved products 
further  since products under development are often announced before introduction  these announcements may cause customers to delay purchases of any products  even if newly introduced  until the new or improved versions of those products are available 
if customer orders decrease or are delayed during the product transition  spectralink may experience a decline in revenue and have excess inventory on hand which could decrease gross profit margins 
spectralink s gross margins might decrease if customers  who may otherwise choose to purchase existing products  instead choose to purchase lower priced models of new products 
delays or deficiencies in the development  manufacturing  and delivery of  or demand for  new or improved products could have a negative effect on spectralink s business  operating results or financial condition 
spectralink s ability to manage potential expansion of operations in the us and internationally 
spectralink intends to expand its existing domestic and international operations and to enter new markets 
this expansion will require significant management attention and financial resources 
spectralink currently has limited experience in marketing and distributing its products internationally and in developing versions of products that comply with local standards 
spectralink may also not be able to maintain or increase international market demand for its products 
international operations are subject to other inherent risks  including foreign government regulation of technology or unexpected changes in regulatory and customs requirements  difficulty and delays in accounts receivable collection  difficulties and costs of staffing and 
table of contents managing foreign operations  reduced protection for intellectual property rights  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  and taxation consequences 
spectralink faces increasing competition in the on premises wireless telephone system market 
the on premises wireless telephone system industry is competitive and influenced by the introduction of new products and new entrants into the industry 
the competitive factors affecting the market for spectralink s systems include product functions and features  frequency band of operation  ease of use  quality of support  product quality and performance  price  network and application integration capabilities  distribution channels  and the effectiveness of marketing and sales efforts 
most of spectralink s competitors have significantly greater financial  technical  research and development  and marketing resources than spectralink 
as a result  spectralink s competitors may respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements  or may devote greater resources to the development  promotion  sale and support of their products than spectralink 
enterprise adoption of standards for wireless lan and voice over ip may lead to the commoditization of wireless telephone technology and the availability of low cost alternative products 
in addition  some purchasers may prefer to buy their wireless telephone systems from a single source provider of telephone systems  such as alcatel or cisco systems  both of which manufacture and sell enterprise telephone systems 
other purchasers may prefer to buy their wireless telephone systems from a single source provider of wireless local area networks  or lans  such as cisco systems or symbol technologies  both of which provide wireless infrastructure and wireless telephones 
because spectralink focuses on wireless on premises telephone communications  it cannot serve as the sole source for a complete telephone or data communications system 
there is no assurance that spectralink will be able to compete successfully in the future 
further  if a potential customer is already using a competing product or system  that potential customer may not be willing or able to make the investment necessary to replace such a system with a spectralink wireless telephone system 
in addition  there may be potential customers who choose another technology because of cost or their belief that their needs do not require the full function provided by a spectralink wireless telephone system 
the certification and approval process for spectralink s netlink product for use in countries that support the b standard 
foreign countries which support the b standard could provide future markets for the netlink products 
however  countries certification and approval processes for b compatible products  such as those of spectralink  are typically time consuming and costly 
if spectralink has difficulty obtaining certification and approval by foreign countries for its netlink product  then spectralink may not be able to gain access to the markets in these countries in a timely fashion  if at all  which would limit international growth of spectralink s business 
spectralink s ability to protect its intellectual property rights 
spectralink s future success depends  in part  upon its proprietary technology 
spectralink relies on a combination of patent  copyright  trade secret and trademark laws  confidentiality procedures  and nondisclosure and other contractual provisions to protect its proprietary rights 
these legal protections provide only limited protection and may be time consuming and expensive to obtain and enforce 
there can be no assurance that spectralink s issued patents will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors or provide meaningful protection against competition 
if challenged  spectralink s patents might not be upheld or their claims could be narrowed 
if spectralink fails to protect its proprietary rights adequately  spectralink s competitors might gain access to spectralink s technology 
as a result  spectralink s competitors might offer similar products and spectralink might not be able to compete successfully in its market 
moreover  despite spectralink s efforts to protect its proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may copy aspects of spectralink s products and obtain and use information that spectralink regards as proprietary 
also  spectralink s competitors may independently develop similar  but not infringing  technology  duplicate spectralink s products  or design around spectralink s patents or its other intellectual property 
in addition  other parties may breach confidentiality agreements or other protective contracts with spectralink  and spectralink may not be able to enforce its rights in the event of these breaches 
furthermore  spectralink expects that it will increase its international operations in the future  and the laws of many foreign countries do not protect spectralink s intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
spectralink may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect its intellectual property rights 
any litigation surrounding spectralink s rights could force spectralink to divert important financial and other resources from its business operations 
the assertion of intellectual property infringement claims against spectralink 
spectralink s industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
spectralink cannot be certain that its products do not and will not infringe upon issued patents  patents to be issued in the future  or other intellectual property rights of others 

table of contents spectralink may in the future be notified that it is infringing upon certain patent and or other intellectual property rights of others 
although there are no such pending lawsuits against spectralink or unresolved notices that spectralink is infringing upon intellectual property rights of others  there can be no assurance that infringement claims will not occur in the future 
from time to time  third parties may assert exclusive patent  copyright  trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related methods that are important to spectralink 
litigation may be necessary in the future to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity  to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others  to enforce spectralink s intellectual property rights  or to protect spectralink s trade secrets 
spectralink may also be subject to claims from customers for indemnification 
any resulting litigation  regardless of its resolution  could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources 
if it were determined that spectralink s products infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others  spectralink would need to obtain licenses from these parties or reengineer its products in order to avoid infringement 
spectralink might not be able to obtain the necessary licenses on acceptable terms or at all  or to reengineer its products successfully 
moreover  if spectralink is sued for infringement and loses the suit  it could be required to pay substantial damages or be enjoined from licensing or using the infringing products or technology 
any of the foregoing could cause spectralink to incur significant costs and prevent it from selling its products 
recently enacted and proposed changes in securities laws and regulations are likely to increase spectralink s costs 
the sarbanes oxley act of that became law in july  as well as new rules subsequently implemented by the sec  requires changes in some of spectralink s corporate governance  public disclosure and compliance practices 
the act also requires the sec to implement additional new rules on a variety of subjects 
in addition to final rules and rule proposals already made by the sec  the nasdaq national market has adopted revisions to its requirements for companies  such as spectralink  that are nasdaq listed 
these developments have increased spectralink s legal and financial compliance costs  and make some activities  like sec reporting obligations  more difficult 
in addition  spectralink expects these developments to make it more difficult and more expensive for spectralink to obtain director and officer liability insurance  and spectralink may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage 
these developments could make it more difficult for spectralink to attract and retain qualified members of spectralink s board of directors  particularly to serve on spectralink s audit committee  and qualified executive officers 
spectralink is presently evaluating and monitoring regulatory developments and cannot estimate the timing or magnitude of additional costs spectralink may incur as a result 
spectralink s reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
generally accepted accounting principles in the united states are subject to issuance and interpretation by the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  the american institute of certified public accountants  the securities and exchange commission  sec  and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles 
a change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on spectralink s reported financial results  and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of a change 
for example  spectralink currently is not required to record stock based compensation charges if the employee s stock option exercise price is equal to or exceeds the deemed fair value of spectralink s common stock at the date of grant 
however  several companies have recently elected to change their accounting policies and begun to record the fair value of stock options as an expense 
although the standards have not been finalized and the timing of a final statement has not been established  fasb has announced its support for recording expense for the fair value of stock options granted 
spectralink s reported earnings would be harmed if spectralink were required to change its accounting policy in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
the historic volatility of spectralink s stock price  which may make it more difficult to resell shares at prices attractive to sellers 
the market price of spectralink s common stock has been volatile and is likely to remain subject to wide fluctuations in the future 
for example  during the month period ended december   the closing price of spectralink s common stock has ranged from a high of per share to a low of per share 
many factors could cause the market price of spectralink s common stock to fluctuate  including variations in spectralink s actual or anticipated quarterly or annual results  market conditions in spectralink s industry  the industries of spectralink s customers and the economy as a whole  announcements of technological innovations by spectralink or by its competitors  introduction of new products or product enhancements or new pricing policies by spectralink or by its competitors  
table of contents acquisitions or strategic alliances by spectralink or by its competitors  recruitment or departure of key personnel  the gain or loss of significant orders  changes in the market valuations of other telecommunications companies  the amount of liquid financial resources available to spectralink  the gain or loss of significant customers  and changes in the estimates of spectralink s operating performance or changes in recommendations by securities analysts 
in addition  the stock market in general  and the market for technology related stocks in particular  could decline  which could cause the market price of spectralink s common stock to fall for reasons not necessarily related to spectralink s business  results of operations or financial condition 
the market price of spectralink s stock also might decline in reaction to events that affect other companies in spectralink s industry even if these events do not directly affect spectralink 
accordingly  you may not be able to resell your shares of common stock at or above the price you paid 
securities class action litigation is often brought against a company following a period of volatility in the market price of its securities  and spectralink has previously been sued in several purported securities class action lawsuits 
further  certain of spectralink s management and directors were also sued in purported shareholder derivative actions 
although spectralink believes that the lawsuits lack merit  due to inherent uncertainties in litigation  spectralink cannot accurately predict the outcome of this litigation 
an adverse determination could have a significant effect upon spectralink s business and materially affect the price of its stock 
moreover  regardless of the ultimate result  it is likely that the lawsuits will require spectralink to incur expenses and divert management s attention and resources from other matters  which could also adversely affect spectralink s business and the price of its stock
