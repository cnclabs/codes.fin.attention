table of contents part i item business overview we were founded in and are one of the largest radio broadcasting companies in the united states 
we are also the largest radio broadcasting company in the united states primarily targeting african americans 
we own and or operate radio stations in markets 
of these  fm and am are in of the top african american radio markets 
we currently program five channels on the xm satellite radio system and own approximately of tv one  llc  an african american targeted cable channel  which is a joint venture with an affiliate of comcast corporation and other investors 
our strategy is to expand within our existing markets and into new markets that have a significant african american presence 
we believe radio broadcasting primarily targeting african americans continues to have significant growth potential 
we also believe that we have a competitive advantage in the african american market and the radio industry in general  due to our primary focus on urban formats  our skill in programming and marketing these formats  and our turnaround expertise 
radio one is led by our chairperson and co founder  catherine l 
hughes  and her son  alfred c 
liggins  iii  our chief executive officer and president  who together have over years of operating experience in radio broadcasting 
ms 
hughes  mr 
liggins and our strong management team have successfully implemented a strategy of acquiring and turning around underperforming radio stations 
we believe that we are well positioned to apply our proven operating strategies to our portfolio of radio stations as  in our estimation  many of our stations are not mature and have upside potential 
we will also apply these strategies to other radio stations that we acquire in existing and new markets as attractive acquisition opportunities arise 
significant and recent events wsnj fm philadelphia acquisition in february  we completed the acquisition of the assets of wsnj fm  licensed to bridgeton  new jersey  from new jersey radio partners  llc for approximately million in cash 
the fcc has approved changing the station s community of license to pennsauken  new jersey 
we are currently reviewing our location options to best serve the greater philadelphia radio market 
this acquisition increased the number of stations owned by us in the philadelphia market to three 
wrnb fm dayton acquisition in july  we completed the purchase of the outstanding stock of hawes saunders broadcast properties  inc  owner and operator of wrnb fm formerly wrou fm licensed to west carrollton  ohio  for approximately million in cash 
wrnb fm had been a primary competitor of one of our other stations in the dayton market 
we began operating the station under a local marketing agreement in march this acquisition increased the number of stations owned by us in the dayton market to five 
tv one joint venture in july  we entered into a joint venture agreement with an affiliate of comcast corporation and other investors to create tv one  llc tv one  an entity formed to launch a cable television network featuring entertainment  opinion and news related programming targeted primarily towards african american viewers 
we expect to make a cash investment of approximately million in tv one over four years 
we will also provide advertising and management services to tv one over the next five years through january  for which we have received additional equity in tv one 
in connection with the receipt of this equity in consideration for these services  we recorded additional equity received in tv one of approximately million and a corresponding deferred revenue liability 
we based this value on cash exchanges for similar equity instruments in tv one 

table of contents in august  we made our first capital contribution of approximately million to tv one 
on a fully diluted basis  we own approximately of tv one 
we account for this investment under the equity method of accounting and accordingly  we recognize our ratable share of tv one s net income or loss

in addition  the african american consumer tends to have a different consumption profile than non african americans 
an annual report published by target market news provides a list of products and services for which african american households spent more than white households 
in the most recent such annual report  there were dozens of such products and services listed in categories such as apparel and accessories  books  cars and trucks  consumer electronics  food  personal care products  telephone service and transportation

growth in advertising targeting the african american market 
we continue to believe that large corporate advertisers are becoming more focused on reaching minority consumers in the united states 
the african american community is considered an emerging growth market within the mature domestic market 
it is estimated that major national advertisers spent over billion on advertising that targets african american consumers in  up from million in source target market news  
we believe many large corporations are expanding their commitment to ethnic advertising 
growing influence of african american culture 
we believe that there continues to be an ongoing urbanization of many facets of american society as evidenced by the influence of african american culture in the areas of music for example  hip hop and rap music  film  fashion  sports and urban oriented television shows and networks 
we believe that many companies from a broad range of industries and prominent fashion designers have embraced this urbanization trend in their products as well as their advertising messages 
growing popularity of radio formats primarily targeting african americans 
we believe that urban programming has been expanded to target a more diverse urban listener base and has become more popular with listeners and advertisers over the past ten years

relative to radio broadcasters targeting a broader audience  we believe we can cover the various segments of our target market with fewer programming formats and therefore fewer radio stations than the maximum per market allowed by the fcc

source arbitron black radio today and arbitron radio today  
we believe that african american radio listeners exhibit greater loyalty to radio stations that target the african american community because those radio stations become a valuable source of entertainment and information responsive to the community s interests and lifestyles 
acquisition strategy our acquisition strategy includes acquiring and turning around underperforming radio stations principally in the top african american markets 
we also seek to make acquisitions in existing markets where expanded coverage is desirable and in new markets where we believe it is advantageous to establish a presence 
for strategic reasons  or as a result of an acquisition of multiple stations in a market  we may also acquire and operate stations with formats that primarily target non african american segments of the population

through our national presence we also provide advertisers with a radio station advertising platform that is a unique and powerful delivery mechanism to african americans 
the success of our strategy relies on the following market research  targeted programming and marketing  strong management and performance based incentives  radio station clustering  programming segmentation and sales bundling  strategic sales efforts  marketing platform to national advertisers  advertising partnerships and special events  and significant community involvement 
market research  targeted programming and marketing we use market research to tailor the programming  marketing and promotions of our radio stations to maximize audience share 
we also use our research to reinforce our current programming and to identify unserved or underserved markets or segments of the african american community in current and new markets 
table of contents and to determine whether to acquire a new radio station or reprogram one of our existing radio stations to target those markets or segments 
we also seek to reinforce our targeted programming by creating a distinct and marketable identity for each of our radio stations 
to achieve this objective  in addition to our significant community involvement discussed below  we employ and promote distinct  high profile on air personalities at many of our radio stations  many of whom have strong ties to the african american community 
strong management and performance based incentives we focus on hiring and retaining highly motivated and talented individuals in each functional area of our organization who can effectively help us implement our growth and operating strategies 
our management team is comprised of a diverse group of individuals who bring expertise to their respective functional areas 
we seek to hire and promote individuals with significant potential by providing the ability to operate with high levels of autonomy and the appropriate team orientation that will enable them to pursue their careers within radio one 
to enhance the quality of our management in the areas of sales and programming  general managers  sales managers and program directors have significant portions of their compensation tied to the achievement of certain performance goals 
general managers compensation is based partially on achieving station operating income benchmarks  which creates an incentive for management to focus on both sales growth and expense control 
additionally  sales managers and sales personnel have incentive packages based on sales goals  and program directors and on air talent have incentive packages focused on maximizing ratings in specific target segments 
radio station clustering  programming segmentation and sales bundling we strive to build clusters of radio stations in our markets  with each radio station targeting different demographic segments of the african american population 
this clustering and programming segmentation strategy allows us to achieve greater penetration into each segment of our target market 
we are then able to offer advertisers multiple audiences and to bundle the radio stations for advertising sales purposes when advantageous 
we believe there are several potential benefits that result from operating multiple radio stations in the same market 
first  each additional radio station in a market provides us with a larger percentage of the prime advertising time available for sale within that market 
second  the more stations we program  the greater the market share we can achieve in our target demographic groups through the use of segmented programming 
third  we are often able to consolidate sales  promotional  technical support and business functions to produce substantial cost savings 
finally  the purchase of additional radio stations in an existing market allows us to take advantage of our market expertise and existing relationships with advertisers 
strategic sales efforts we have assembled an effective  highly trained sales staff responsible for converting audience share into revenue 
we operate with a focused  sales oriented culture which rewards aggressive selling efforts through a commission and bonus compensation structure 
we hire and deploy large teams of sales professionals for each of our stations or station clusters  and we provide these teams with the resources necessary to compete effectively in the markets in which we operate 
we utilize various sales strategies to sell and market our stations as stand alones  in combination with other stations within a given market  and across markets  where appropriate 
marketing platform to national advertisers through our acquisitions  we have created a national platform of radio stations in some of the largest african american markets 
this platform reaches over million listeners weekly  more than any other media 
table of contents vehicle primarily targeting african americans 
thus  national advertisers find advertising on all our radio stations an efficient and cost effective way to reach this target audience 
through our corporate sales department we bundle and sell this national platform of radio stations to national advertisers thereby enhancing our revenue generating opportunities  expanding our base of advertisers  creating greater demand for our advertising time inventory and increasing the capacity utilization of our inventory and making our sales effort more efficient 
advertising partnerships and special events we believe that in order to create advertising loyalty  we must strive to be the recognized expert in marketing to the african american consumer in the markets in which we operate 
we believe that we have achieved this recognition by focusing on serving the african american consumer and by creating innovative advertising campaigns and promotional tie ins with our advertising clients and sponsoring numerous entertainment events each year 
in these events  advertisers buy signage  booth space and broadcast promotions to sell a variety of goods and services to african american consumers 
as we expand our presence in our existing markets and into new markets  we plan to increase the number of events and the number of markets in which we host these major events based upon our evaluation of the financial viability and economic benefits of such events 
significant community involvement we believe our active involvement and significant relationships in the african american community provide a competitive advantage in targeting african american audiences 
in this way  we believe our proactive involvement in the african american community in each of our markets significantly improves the marketability of our radio broadcast time to advertisers who are targeting such communities 
we believe that a radio station s image should reflect the lifestyle and viewpoints of the target demographic group it serves 
due to our fundamental understanding of the african american community  we believe we are able to identify music and musical styles  as well as political and social trends and issues  early in their evolution 
this understanding is then integrated into significant aspects of our operations and enables us to create enhanced awareness and name recognition in the marketplace 
in addition  we believe our multi level approach to community involvement leads to increased effectiveness in developing and updating our programming formats 
we believe our enhanced awareness and more effective programming formats lead to greater listenership and higher ratings over the long term 
turnaround expertise many of the stations we have acquired have been  in our opinion  underperforming 
by implementing our operating strategy  we have succeeded in increasing the ratings  net broadcast revenue and station operating income of many of the fm stations we have owned and or operated 
we have achieved these improvements while  in many instances  competing against larger media companies 
our turnaround strategy has been especially successful with respect to our operations in atlanta  cincinnati  detroit  los angeles  minneapolis  and raleigh

advertising revenue substantially all of our net broadcast revenue is generated from the sale of local and national advertising for broadcast on our radio stations 
local sales are made by the sales staffs located in our markets 
national sales are made by firms specializing in radio advertising sales on the national level  in exchange for a commission from radio one that is based on a percentage of our net broadcast revenue from the advertising obtained 
approximately of our net broadcast revenue for the year ended december  was generated from the 
table of contents sale of local advertising and from sales to national advertisers  including network advertising 
the balance of net broadcast revenue is primarily derived from tower rental income  ticket sales and revenue related to radio one sponsored events and other revenue 
we believe that advertisers can reach the african american community more cost effectively through radio broadcasting than through newspapers or television 
advertising rates charged by radio stations are based primarily on a radio station s audience share within the demographic groups targeted by the advertisers  the number of radio stations in the market competing for the same demographic groups  and the supply and demand for radio advertising time 
advertising rates are generally highest during the morning and afternoon commuting hours 
a radio station s listenership is reflected in ratings surveys that estimate the number of listeners tuned to a radio station and the time they spend listening to that radio station 
each radio station s ratings are used by its advertisers to consider advertising with the radio station  and are used by us to chart audience growth  set advertising rates and adjust programming 
strategic diversification we continue to explore opportunities in other forms of media that are complementary to our core radio business which will allow us to leverage our expertise in marketing to african americans and our significant listener base 
such opportunities could include an urban oriented radio network  outdoor advertising in urban environments  music production  publishing and other related businesses 
to that end we currently have investments in tv one  llc  an entity formed to launch a cable television network offering programming targeted primarily towards african american viewers  ibiquity digital corporation  a leading developer of in band on channel digital broadcast technology  pne media holdings  llc  a privately held outdoor advertising company with a presence in several of the markets in which we own radio stations pne sold most of its assets to nextmedia group  inc and currently holds an approximate ownership interest in nextmedia  and quetzal jp morgan partners  quetzal jp  an entity formed for the purpose of investing in minority owned telecommunications entities 
competition the radio broadcasting industry is highly competitive 
radio one s stations compete for audiences and advertising revenue with other radio stations and with other media such as television  the internet  newspapers  direct mail and outdoor advertising  some of which may be controlled by horizontally integrated companies 
audience ratings and advertising revenue are subject to change and any adverse change in a market could adversely affect our net broadcast revenue in that market 
if a competing station converts to a format similar to that of one of our stations  or if one of our competitors strengthens its operations  our stations could suffer a reduction in ratings and advertising revenue 
other radio companies which are larger and have more resources may also enter markets where we operate 
although we believe our stations are well positioned to compete  we cannot assure that our stations will maintain or increase their current ratings or advertising revenue 
the radio broadcasting industry is also subject to technological change  evolving industry standards and the emergence of new media technologies 
several new media technologies have been or are being developed  including the following audio programming by cable television systems  direct broadcast satellite systems  internet content providers both landline and wireless and other digital audio broadcast formats  satellite digital audio radio service  which has resulted in the introduction of two new subscriber based satellite radio services with numerous channels and sound quality equivalent to that of compact discs  
table of contents in band on channel digital radio  which could provide multi channel  multi format digital radio services in the same bandwidth currently occupied by traditional am and fm radio services  and low power fm radio  which has resulted in additional fm radio broadcast outlets that are designed to serve localized areas 
we have arrangements in place to enable us to adapt to these new media technologies 
for example  we are party to a programming agreement with xm satellite radio inc  a satellite digital audio radio service and have also invested in ibiquity digital corporation  a developer of digital audio broadcast technology used in several of our markets 
however  we cannot assure that these arrangements will be successful or enable us to adapt effectively to these new media technologies 
we also cannot assure that we will continue to have the resources to acquire other new technologies or to introduce new services that could compete with other new technologies 
antitrust regulation an important part of our growth strategy is the acquisition of additional radio stations 
the agencies responsible for enforcing the federal antitrust laws  the federal trade commission and the department of justice  may investigate certain acquisitions 
after the passage of the telecommunications act of  the department of justice gave increased attention to reviewing proposed acquisitions of radio stations 
the justice department is likely to focus particular attention when the proposed buyer already owns one or more radio stations in the market of the station it is seeking to buy 
the justice department has challenged a number of radio broadcasting transactions 
some of those challenges ultimately resulted in consent decrees requiring  among other things  divestitures of certain stations 
in general  the justice department has more closely scrutinized radio station acquisitions where the involved radio stations account for a significant percentage of local radio advertising revenue 
we cannot predict the outcome of any specific department of justice or ftc review of a particular acquisition 
any decision by the department of justice or ftc to challenge a proposed acquisition could affect our ability to consummate an acquisition or to consummate it on the proposed terms 
for an acquisition meeting certain size thresholds  the hart scott rodino act requires the parties to file notification and report forms concerning antitrust issues with the department of justice and the ftc and to observe specified waiting period requirements before consummating the acquisition 
if the investigating agency raises substantive issues in connection with a proposed transaction  the parties involved frequently engage in lengthy discussions and or negotiations with the investigating agency to address those issues  including restructuring the proposed acquisition or divesting assets 
in addition  the investigating agency could file suit in federal court to enjoin the acquisition or to require the divestiture of assets  among other remedies 
all acquisitions  regardless of whether they are required to be reported under the hart scott rodino act  may be investigated by the department of justice or the ftc under the antitrust laws before or after consummation 
in addition  private parties may under certain circumstances bring legal action to challenge an acquisition under the antitrust laws 
as part of its increased scrutiny of radio station acquisitions  the department of justice has stated publicly that it believes that local marketing agreements  joint sales agreements  time brokerage agreements and other similar agreements customarily entered into in connection with radio station transfers could violate the hart scott rodino act if such agreements take effect prior to the expiration of the waiting period under the hart scott rodino act 
furthermore  the department of justice has noted that joint sales agreements may raise antitrust concerns under section of the sherman act and has challenged joint sales agreements in certain locations 
as indicated above  the department of justice also has stated publicly that it has established certain revenue and audience share concentration benchmarks with respect to radio station acquisitions  above which a transaction may receive additional antitrust scrutiny 
however  to date  the department of justice has also investigated transactions that do not meet or exceed these benchmarks and has cleared transactions that do exceed these benchmarks 
in the past  the federal communications commission fcc has exercised its discretion to review individual fcc assignment or transfer of control applications involving proposed radio broadcasting transactions 
table of contents that it believes might raise excessive market concentration issues even where an application complies with the fcc s media ownership limits 
as part of its june decision revising media ownership rules  which proceeding is discussed below  the fcc announced that it would no longer follow this former practice of flagging certain assignment and transfer of control applications that raise competitive concerns for its staff to conduct a competitive analysis of the particular market 
the fcc continues to adhere to this shift in practice during the pendency of a temporary judicial stay of the revised media ownership rules adopted in the june decision 
federal regulation of radio broadcasting the radio broadcasting industry is subject to extensive and changing regulation by the fcc of programming  technical operations  employment and other business practices 
the fcc regulates radio broadcast stations pursuant to the communications act of  as amended 
the communications act permits the operation of radio broadcast stations only in accordance with a license issued by the fcc upon a finding that the grant of a license would serve the public interest  convenience and necessity 
among other things  the fcc assigns frequency bands for radio broadcasting  determines the particular frequencies  locations  operating power  interference standards and other technical parameters of radio broadcast stations  issues  renews  revokes and modifies radio broadcast station licenses  imposes annual regulatory fees and application processing fees to recover its administrative costs  establishes technical requirements for certain transmitting equipment to restrict harmful emissions  adopts and implements regulations and policies that directly or indirectly affect the ownership  operation  program content and employment and business practices of radio broadcast stations  and has the power to impose penalties  including monetary forfeitures  for violations of its rules and the communications act 
general 
the communications act prohibits the assignment of an fcc license  or transfer of control of an fcc licensee  without the prior approval of the fcc 
in determining whether to grant requests for consents to assignments or transfers  and in determining whether to grant or renew a radio broadcast license  the fcc considers a number of factors pertaining to the licensee and any proposed licensee  including restrictions on foreign ownership  compliance with fcc media ownership limits and other fcc rules  the character of the licensee and those persons holding attributable interests in the licensee  and compliance with the anti drug abuse act of the following is a brief summary of certain provisions of the communications act and specific fcc rules and policies 
this summary does not purport to be a complete listing of all of the regulations and policies affecting radio stations and is qualified in its entirety by the text of the communications act  the fcc s rules  regulations and policies  and the rulings and public notices of the fcc 
you should refer to the communications act and these fcc notices  rules and rulings for further information concerning the nature and extent of federal regulation of radio broadcast stations 
a licensee s failure to comply with the requirements of the communications act or fcc rules and policies may result in the imposition of various sanctions  including admonishment  fines  the grant of a license renewal of less than a full eight year term  the grant of a license or license renewal with conditions or  for particularly egregious violations  the denial of a license renewal application  the revocation of an fcc license and or the denial of fcc consent to acquire additional broadcast properties 
congress  the fcc and  in some cases  local jurisdictions  have had under consideration or reconsideration  or may in the future consider and adopt  new laws  regulations and policies regarding a wide variety of matters 
table of contents that could  directly or indirectly  affect the operation  ownership and profitability of our radio stations  result in the loss of audience share and advertising revenue for our radio broadcast stations or affect our ability to acquire additional radio broadcast stations or finance such acquisitions 
such matters include or may include changes to the license authorization and renewal process  proposals to impose spectrum use or other fees on fcc licensees  changes to rules relating to political broadcasting including proposals to grant free air time to candidates  and other changes regarding political and non political program content  funding  political advertising rates  and sponsorship disclosures  proposals to restrict or prohibit the advertising of beer  wine and other alcoholic beverages  proposals to regulate the broadcast of indecent or violent content  technical and frequency allocation matters  changes in broadcast multiple ownership  foreign ownership  cross ownership and ownership attribution policies  including the definition of the local market for multiple ownership purposes and the attribution of joint sales agreements for purposes of the fcc s multiple ownership rules  changes to allow telephone companies to deliver audio and video programming to homes in their service areas  and proposals to alter provisions of the tax laws affecting broadcast operations and acquisitions 
finally  the fcc has adopted procedures for the auction of broadcast spectrum in circumstances where two or more parties have filed mutually exclusive applications for authority to construct new stations or certain major changes in existing stations 
such procedures may limit our efforts to modify or expand the broadcast signals of our stations 
we cannot predict what changes  if any  might be adopted  nor can we predict what other matters might be considered in the future  nor can we judge in advance what impact  if any  the implementation of any particular proposals or changes might have on our business 
fcc license grants and renewals 
in making licensing determinations  the fcc considers an applicant s legal  technical  financial and other qualifications 
the fcc grants radio broadcast station licenses for specific periods of time and  upon application  may renew them for additional terms 
a station may continue to operate beyond the expiration date of its license if a timely filed license renewal application is pending 
under the communications act  radio broadcast station licenses may be granted for a maximum term of eight years 
generally  the fcc renews radio broadcast licenses without a hearing upon a finding that the radio station has served the public interest  convenience and necessity  there have been no serious violations by the licensee of the communications act or fcc rules and regulations  and there have been no other violations by the licensee of the communications act or fcc rules and regulations which  taken together  indicate a pattern of abuse 
after considering these factors and any petitions to deny a license renewal application which may lead to a hearing  the fcc may grant the license renewal application with or without conditions  including renewal for a term less than the maximum otherwise permitted 
historically  our licenses have been renewed without any conditions or sanctions imposed 
however  there can be no assurance that the licenses of each of our stations will be renewed  will be renewed for a full term or will be renewed without conditions or sanctions 

table of contents in august  chairman powell announced the creation of a localism task force to advise the fcc on steps the fcc and congress can take to strengthen localism in television and radio broadcasting 
the localism task force s findings and recommendations could affect future licensing decisions 
types of fcc broadcast licenses 
the fcc classifies each am and fm radio station 
an am radio station operates on either a clear channel  regional channel or local channel 
a clear channel is assigned to serve wide areas  particularly at night 
a regional channel is assigned to serve primarily a principal center of population and the rural areas contiguous to it 
a local channel is assigned to operate unlimited time and serve primarily a community and the suburban and rural areas immediately contiguous to it 
class a radio stations operate unlimited time and are designed to render primary and secondary service over an extended area 
class b radio stations operate unlimited time and are designed to render service only over a primary service area 
class d radio stations operate either daytime  during limited times only  or unlimited time with low nighttime power 
class c radio stations operate unlimited time and are designed to render service only over a primary service area that may be reduced as a consequence of interference 
fm class designations depend upon the geographic zone in which the transmitter of the fm radio station is located 
the minimum and maximum facilities requirements for an fm radio station are determined by its class 
in general  commercial fm radio stations are classified as follows  in order of increasing power and antenna height class a  b  c  b  c  c  c and c 
the fcc has adopted a rule that subjects class c fm stations that do not satisfy a certain antenna height requirement to an involuntary downgrade in class to class c under certain circumstances 
radio one s licenses 
the following table sets forth information with respect to each of our radio stations 
a broadcast station s market may be different from its community of license 
the coverage of an am radio station is chiefly a function of the power of the radio station s transmitter  less dissipative power losses and any directional antenna adjustments 
for fm radio stations  signal coverage area is chiefly a function of the erp of the radio station s antenna and the haat of the radio station s antenna 
erp refers to the effective radiated power of an fm radio station 
haat refers to the antenna height above average terrain of an fm radio station

ownership matters 
the communications act requires prior approval of the fcc for the assignment of a broadcast license or the transfer of control of a corporation or other entity holding a license 
in determining whether to approve an assignment of a radio broadcast license or a transfer of control of a broadcast licensee  the fcc considers  among other things the financial and legal qualifications of the prospective assignee or transferee  including compliance with fcc restrictions on non us citizen or entity ownership and control  compliance with fcc rules  regulations and policies  including rules limiting the common ownership or control of media properties in a given market  the history of the parties compliance with fcc rules  and the character qualifications of the transferee or assignee and the individuals or entities holding attributable interests in them 
to obtain the fcc s prior consent to assign or transfer a broadcast license an appropriate application must be filed with the fcc 
if the application to assign or transfer the license involves a substantial change in ownership or control of the licensee  for example  the transfer or acquisition of more than of the voting stock  the application must be placed on an fcc public notice for a period of days during which petitions to deny the application may be filed by interested parties 
informal objections may be filed any time until the fcc acts upon the application 
if the fcc grants an assignment or transfer application  administrative procedures provide for reconsideration of the grant 
the communications act also permits the appeal of a contested grant to a federal court in certain instances 
under the communications act  a broadcast license may not be granted to or held by any persons who are not us citizens  whom the communications act and fcc rules refer to as aliens  including any corporation that has more than of its capital stock owned or voted by non us citizens or entities or their representatives  by foreign governments or their representatives  or by non us corporations 
furthermore  the communications act restricts indirect foreign ownership if the fcc finds the public interest will be served by 
table of contents the refusal or revocation of such license 
thus  for instance  the licenses for our stations could be revoked if more than of our outstanding capital stock is issued to or for the benefit of non us citizens 
the fcc generally applies its media ownership limits  which are discussed below  to attributable interests held by an individual  corporation  partnership or other association or entity  including limited liability companies 
in the case of a corporation holding broadcast licenses  the interests of officers  directors and those who  directly or indirectly hold five percent or more of the total outstanding votes of a licensee corporation are generally deemed attributable interests 
certain passive investors that hold stock for investment purposes only become attributable with the ownership of or more of the voting stock of the corporation holding broadcast licenses 
an entity with one or more radio stations in a radio market that enters into a local marketing agreement or a time brokerage agreement with another radio station in the same market obtains an attributable interest in the brokered radio station for purposes of the fcc s local radio station ownership rules  if the brokering station supplies more than of the brokered radio station s weekly broadcast hours 
similarly  the fcc has voted to approve a new rule  currently stayed by court action pending review  that would make a station licensee s rights under a contract to sell more than per week of the advertising time on another station in the same market an attributable ownership interest for purposes of the fcc s ownership rules 
under the fcc s current policies  debt instruments  non voting stock  options and warrants for voting stock that have not yet been exercised  minority voting interests in corporations having a single majority shareholder and insulated limited partnership or limited liability company membership interests where the interest holder is not materially involved in the media related activities of the partnership or company generally do not subject their holders to attribution unless such interests implicate the fcc s equity debt plus or edp rule 
under the edp rule  a major programming supplier or a same market media entity will be an attributable owner of a station if the supplier or same market media entity holds debt or equity  or both  in the station that is greater than of the value of the station s total debt plus equity 
for purposes of the edp rule  equity includes all stock  whether voting or nonvoting  and equity held by insulated limited partners or limited liability company members 
debt includes all liabilities  whether long term or short term 
a major programming supplier includes any programming supplier that provides more than of the station s weekly programming hours 
a same market media entity subject to the ownership restrictions applicable to radio stations includes any holder of an attributable interest in a broadcast station or daily newspaper  located in the same market as the station  but only if the holder s interest is attributable under an fcc attribution rule other than the edp rule 
the communications act and fcc rules generally restrict ownership  operation or control of  or the common holding of attributable interests in radio broadcast stations above certain numerical limits serving the same local market  radio broadcast stations combined with television broadcast stations above certain numerical limits serving the same local market radio television cross ownership  and a radio broadcast station and an english language daily newspaper serving the same local market newspaper broadcast cross ownership 
current fcc radio broadcast ownership rules allow one entity to own  control or hold attributable interests in an unlimited number of fm radio stations and am radio stations nationwide 
the communications act and the fcc s rules limit the number of radio broadcast stations in local markets in which a single entity may hold an attributable interest as follows in a radio market with or more commercial radio stations  a party may own  operate or control up to eight commercial radio stations  not more than five of which are in the same service am or fm 
in a radio market with to commercial radio stations  a party may own  operate or control up to seven commercial radio stations  not more than four of which are in the same service am or fm 
in a radio market with to commercial radio stations  a party may own  operate or control up to six commercial radio stations  not more than four of which are in the same service am or fm 

table of contents in a radio market with or fewer commercial radio stations  a party may own  operate or control up to five commercial radio stations  not more than three of which are in the same service am or fm  except that a party may not own  operate  or control more than percent of the radio stations in such market 
to apply these four local numerical caps or tiers  the fcc has adopted rules for defining local radio market areas and the number of radio stations in such markets 
for a number of years  the fcc has employed a relatively complex contour overlap methodology 
under this approach  the fcc uses one overlapping contour methodology for defining a local radio market and counting the number of stations that the applicant controls or proposes to control in that market  and it employs a separate overlapping contour methodology for determining the number of operating commercial radio stations in the market for determining compliance with the local radio ownership caps 
these rules are subject to periodic review by the fcc 
in june  the fcc voted to approve changes to its media ownership rules as part of its periodic review 
the decision adopting new media ownership rules is currently on appeal to the united states court of appeals for the third circuit  which decided to stay the new rules during the appeal 
the new rules  therefore  have not gone into effect 
further  the new rules are subject to petitions for reconsideration at the fcc 
if they become effective  the revised radio ownership rules adopted in june would make several changes  including the rules would rely on arbitron metro survey areas in portions of the country where they exist  rather than the contour overlap methodology  to define local radio markets and as the focal point for determining the number of radio stations including both commercial and noncommercial stations under the new rules in the radio market  the rules would make joint sales agreements covering more than of another in markets station s advertising time per week attributable and countable toward the brokering licensee s permissible media ownership limits  the fcc would apply a more liberal cross media limit rule in place of the former newspaper broadcast and radio television cross ownership rules  and the fcc would grandfather existing radio or radio television combinations that otherwise would violate the revised media ownership rules until the combination is sold 
for radio stations located outside arbitron metro survey areas  the fcc instituted a rulemaking to determine how to define local radio markets in such areas 
in the interim  the fcc proposed to apply a modified contour overlap methodology 
during the pendency of the judicial stay of the revised media ownership rules  the fcc is reviewing radio assignment and transfer of control applications based on the contour overlap methodology that was in effect prior to its adoption of the revised rules in june the market definition employed by the fcc to determine compliance with its rules is not necessarily the same as that used for purposes of the hart scott rodino act 
all of these attribution and media ownership rules limit the number of radio stations we may acquire or own in any particular market and may limit the prospective buyers of any stations we want to sell 
the outcome of the appeal of the fcc s new media ownership rules and or the fcc s reconsideration of these rules could affect our business in a number of ways  including  but not limited to  the following if the fcc ultimately enforces a more narrow market definition based upon arbitron or other geographic measures  it could have an adverse effect on our ability to accumulate stations in a given area or to sell a group of stations in a local market to a single entity 
if the fcc ultimately attributes joint sales agreements for multiple ownership purposes  we could be limited in our ability to buy or sell time on certain stations 

table of contents in general terms  if the fcc changes the way it defines markets or determines excess market concentration for purposes of the broadcast multiple ownership rules  we could be limited in our ability to acquire new stations in certain markets  in our ability to operate stations pursuant to certain agreements  and in our ability to improve the coverage contours of our existing stations 
programming and operations 
the communications act requires broadcasters to serve the public interest by presenting programming in response to community problems  needs and interests and maintaining certain records demonstrating its responsiveness 
the fcc will consider complaints from listeners about a broadcast station s programming  and such complaints are required to be placed in a station s public file 
stations also must pay fcc regulatory and application fees  and follow various fcc rules that regulate  among other things  political advertising  the broadcast of obscene or indecent programming  sponsorship identification  the broadcast of contests and lotteries and technical operation  including limits on human exposure to radio frequency radiation 
the fcc s rules prohibit a broadcast licensee from simulcasting more than of its programming on another radio station in the same broadcast service that is  am am or fm fm 
the simulcasting restriction applies if the licensee owns both radio broadcast stations or owns one and programs the other through a local marketing agreement  and only if the contours of the radio stations overlap in a certain manner 
the fcc requires that licensees not discriminate in hiring practices 
in november  the fcc adopted new eeo rules  which became effective march   that bar employment discrimination by broadcast stations on the basis of race  color  religion  national origin or gender 
they also require station employment units with at least five full time employees to widely disseminate information about all full time job openings  absent certain limited exceptions  to recruitment sources  including those requesting to be on the job vacancy notification list  so as to reach all segments of the population in the communities served by the employment unit 
in addition  station employment units must undertake a set number of non vacancy specific outreach initiatives normally every two years from an fcc menu of outreach initiatives  including  for example  meaningful participation in job fairs  internships or scholarship programs 
station employment units subject to these recruitment and outreach requirements must retain various records of their efforts and place in their public inspection files  annually  an eeo public file report posting an electronic version on their internet websites 
radio station employment units with more than full time employees generally must file certain of their annual eeo public file reports with the fcc midway through their license term 
the fcc is considering whether to apply these recruitment requirements to part time employment positions 
from time to time  complaints may be filed against radio one s radio stations alleging violations of these or other rules 
in addition  the fcc may conduct audits or inspections to ensure and verify licensee compliance with fcc rules and regulations 
failure to observe these or other rules and policies can result in the imposition of various sanctions  including fines or conditions  the grant of short less than the maximum eight year renewal terms or  for particularly egregious violations  the denial of a license renewal application or the revocation of a license 
employees as of march   we employed  full time employees and part time employees

item properties and facilities the types of properties required to support each of our radio stations include offices  studios and transmitter antenna sites 
we typically lease our studio and office space with lease terms ranging from five to ten years in length 
a station s studios are generally housed with its offices in downtown or business districts 
we generally consider our facilities to be suitable and of adequate size for our current and intended purposes 
we lease a majority of our main transmitter antenna sites and associated broadcast towers and  when negotiating a lease for such sites  we try to obtain a lengthy lease term with options to renew 
in general  we do not anticipate difficulties in renewing facility or transmitter antenna site leases  or in leasing additional space or sites  if required 
we own substantially all of our equipment  consisting principally of transmitting antennae  transmitters  studio equipment and general office equipment 
the towers  antennae and other transmission equipment used by radio one s stations are generally in good condition  although opportunities to upgrade facilities are periodically reviewed

item legal proceedings in november  radio one and certain of its officers and directors were named as defendants in a class action shareholder complaint filed in the united states district court for the southern district of new york  now captioned  in re radio one  inc initial public offering securities litigation  case no 
cv similar complaints were filed in the same court against hundreds of other public companies issuers that conducted initial public offerings of their common stock in the late s the ipo lawsuits 
in the complaint filed against radio one as amended  the plaintiffs claim that radio one  certain of its officers and directors  and the underwriters of certain of its public offerings violated section of the securities act of based on allegations that its registration statement and prospectus failed to disclose material facts regarding the compensation to be received by  and the stock allocation practices of  the underwriters 
the complaint also contains a claim for violation of section b of the securities exchange act of based on allegations that this omission constituted a deceit on investors 
the plaintiffs seek unspecified monetary damages and other relief 
in july  radio one joined in a global motion  filed by the issuers  to dismiss the ipo lawsuits 
in october  the court entered an order dismissing the company s named officers and directors from the ipo lawsuits without prejudice  pursuant to an agreement tolling the statute of limitations with respect to radio one s officers and directors until september  in february  the court issued a decision denying the motion to dismiss the section and section b claims against radio one and most of the issuers 

table of contents in july  a special litigation committee of radio one s board of directors approved in principle a settlement proposal with the plaintiffs that is anticipated to include most of the issuers 
the proposed settlement would provide for the dismissal with prejudice of all claims against the participating issuers and their officers and the assignment to plaintiffs of certain potential claims that the issuers may have against their underwriters 
the tentative settlement also provides that  in the event that plaintiffs ultimately recover less than a guaranteed sum from the underwriters  plaintiffs would be entitled to payment by each participating issuer s insurer of a pro rata share of any shortfall in the plaintiffs guaranteed recovery 
in september  in connection with the proposed settlement  radio one s named officers and directors extended the tolling agreement so that it would not expire prior to any settlement being finalized 
although we have approved this settlement proposal in principle  it remains subject to a number of procedural conditions  as well as formal approval by the court 
other than legal fees incurred to date  radio one expects that the expenses of settlement  if any  will be paid by its insurance carriers 
until such settlement is finalized  we and our officers and directors intend to continue to defend the actions vigorously 
we are involved from time to time in various routine legal and administrative proceedings and threatened legal and administrative proceedings incidental to the ordinary course of our business

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following information should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
executive summary radio one had a fairly successful year in our net revenue growth of approximately during was modestly higher than the growth of approximately experienced in the radio industry overall 
radio industry growth  which has historically averaged per year over the past years  was primarily affected by the soft economy as well as the effects of the war in iraq  both of which had an adverse effect on the revenues of many similar advertising revenue based businesses 
most of our stations operate in larger radio markets  which have tended to perform better than smaller markets  and we have also benefited from improved ratings performances at many of our radio stations 
consistent with industry trends  we fared better in some markets  especially in atlanta  cincinnati  dallas  indianapolis and minneapolis and underperformed in others  including augusta  charlotte  houston  louisville and richmond 
we tend to see our results diverge from that of the industry based on ratings performance and the quality of the management teams in individual markets 
in response to the soft economy  we also implemented strict cost controls  including a freeze on hiring and salary increases 
these measures allowed us to maintain total operating expenses at levels  resulting in an increase of approximately in our operating income 
during  we reduced our leverage by repaying approximately million of outstanding debt 
we expect that this reduced leverage will enhance our liquidity and improve our borrowing capacity for future growth opportunities  including potential acquisitions 
looking forward  we are optimistic that will be a better year for the radio industry due to the improving economy and the summer olympics and presidential election  two events which  historically  have been positive for advertising based businesses 
radio one continues to be well positioned with radio stations in some of the largest markets in the us many of these stations have experienced good ratings trends 
in addition  we remain committed to controlling our operating costs and continuing to pay down debt in the absence of any acquisition opportunities 
as in past years  we plan to continue to pursue our strategies of acquiring underperforming or strategic stations as well as seeking to build clusters of stations within certain markets to capitalize on our existing infrastructure 
we believe that  as the outlook for our industry improves  may present more attractive opportunities for acquisitions than were available to us in and  and we will continue to look to expand our presence in our existing markets and enter new markets where we find the right opportunities 
at the same time  however  we expect to remain focused on ensuring that the price we pay for any acquisitions is fair and that these acquisitions are financed in such a manner that will not jeopardize our ability to manage and grow the business in times of uncertainty 
introduction revenue and expenses we derive revenue from sales of advertisements and program sponsorships on our stations to local and national advertisers and  to a much lesser extent  tower rental income  independent promotion agreements  ticket and other revenue related to special events we sponsor throughout the year and  beginning in  management fees from our affiliated company  tv one llc gross broadcast revenue 
advertising revenue is affected primarily by the advertising rates our radio stations are able to charge as well as the overall demand for radio advertising time in a market 
these rates are largely based upon a radio station s audience share in the demographic groups targeted by advertisers  the number of radio stations in the related market  and the supply of and demand for radio advertising time 
advertising rates are generally highest during morning and afternoon commuting hours 
in  approximately of our net revenue was generated from local advertising and was generated from national spot advertising  including network advertising 
the balance of revenue was 
table of contents generated primarily from tower rental income  ticket sales and revenue related to our sponsored events and other revenues 
in the broadcasting industry  radio stations often utilize trade or barter agreements to reduce cash expenses by exchanging advertising time for goods or services 
in order to maximize cash revenue from our spot inventory  we minimize the use of trade agreements and have maintained trade revenue at approximately of our net broadcast revenue 
expenses our significant broadcast expenses are i employee salaries and commissions  ii programming expenses  iii advertising and promotion expenses  iv rental of premises for studios  v rental of transmission tower space and vi music license royalty fees 
we strive to control these expenses by centralizing certain functions such as finance  accounting  legal  human resources and management information systems and the overall programming management function 
we also use our multiple stations  market presence and purchasing power to negotiate favorable rates with certain vendors and national representative selling agencies 
we generally incur advertising and promotional expenses to increase our audiences 
however  because arbitron reports ratings quarterly  any changed ratings and therefore the effect on advertising revenues tends to lag behind the incurrence of advertising and promotional expenditures 
depreciation and amortization of costs associated with the acquisition of radio stations and interest carrying charges have historically been significant factors in determining our overall profitability 
however  with the adoption of sfas no 
 amortization expense was greatly reduced in see impact of recent accounting pronouncements below for further discussion 
measurement of performance we monitor the growth and operational results of our business using net income and the following key metrics a net broadcast revenue the performance of an individual radio station or group of radio stations in a particular market is customarily measured by its ability to generate net broadcast revenue 
net broadcast revenue consists of gross broadcast revenue net of local and national agency commissions consistent with industry practice 
net broadcast revenue is recognized in the period in which advertisements are broadcast 
net broadcast revenue also includes advertising aired in exchange for goods and services barter  which is recorded at fair value 
b station operating income operating income before depreciation and amortization  corporate expenses and non cash compensation expenses is commonly referred to in our business as station operating income 
station operating income is not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles 
nevertheless we believe station operating income is often a useful measure of a broadcasting company s operating performance and is a significant basis used by our management to measure the operating performance of our stations within the various markets because station operating income provides helpful information about our results of operations apart from expenses associated with our physical plant  overhead and non cash compensation 
station operating income is frequently used as one of the bases for comparing businesses in our industry  although our measure of station operating income may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies 
station operating income does not purport to represent operating loss or cash flow from operating activities  as those terms are defined under generally accepted accounting principles  and should not be considered as an alternative to those measurements as an indicator of our performance 
c station operating income margin station operating income margin represents station operating income as a percentage of net broadcast revenue 
station operating income margin is not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles 
nevertheless  we believe that station operating 
table of contents income margin is a useful measure of our performance because it provides helpful information about our profitability as a percentage of our net broadcasting revenue 
d ebitda net income or loss before interest income  interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization is commonly referred to in our business as ebitda 
ebitda is not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles 
we believe ebitda is often a useful measure of a company s operating performance and is a significant basis used by our management to measure the operating performance of our business because ebitda excludes charges for depreciation  amortization and interest expense that have resulted from our acquisitions and debt financings 
accordingly  we believe that ebitda provides helpful information about the operating performance of our business  apart from the expenses associated with our physical plant or capital structure 
ebitda is frequently used as one of the bases for comparing businesses in our industry  although our measure of ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies 
ebitda does not purport to represent operating loss or cash flow from operating activities  as those terms are defined under generally accepted accounting principles  and should not be considered as an alternative to those measurements as an indicator of our performance

we have used  and will continue to use  a significant portion of our capital resources to consummate acquisitions 
these acquisitions were or may be funded from our bank credit facility  the proceeds of the historical offerings of our common stock and preferred stock  the proceeds of future common and or preferred stock  and or debt offerings  and internally generated cash flow 
we entered into our amended and restated bank credit facility as of july  under the credit facility  we have borrowed million in term loans and may borrow up to million on a revolving basis 
historically  we have drawn down funds from the credit facility as capital was required  primarily for acquisitions 
as of december   we have repaid million  leaving an outstanding balance of million of term loans  and are able to borrow up to million on a revolving basis  subject to the applicable covenant restrictions under our credit facility 
both the term loan and the revolving commitment under our credit facility bear interest  at our option  at a rate equal to either libor plus a spread that ranges from to or the prime rate plus a spread of up to  depending on our leverage ratio 
under the bank credit facility  we may be required from time to time to protect ourselves from interest rate fluctuations using interest rate hedge agreements 
as a result  we have entered into various fixed rate swap agreements designed to mitigate our exposure to higher floating interest rates 
these swap agreements require that we pay a fixed rate of interest on the notional amount to a bank and that the bank pays to us a variable rate equal to three month libor 
we currently have swap agreements in place for a total notional amount of million 
as of december   the periods remaining on the swap agreements range in duration from six to months 

table of contents our credit exposure under these swap agreements is limited to the cost of replacing an agreement in the event of non performance by our counter party  however  we do not anticipate non performance 
all of the swap agreements are tied to the three month libor interest rate  which may fluctuate significantly on a daily basis 
the valuation of each of these swap agreements is affected by the change in the three month libor rates and the remaining term of the agreement 
any increase in the three month libor rate results in a more favorable valuation  while a decrease in the three month libor rate results in a less favorable valuation

the net proceeds of the offering were primarily used to repay amounts owed on our bank credit facility and previously outstanding senior subordinated notes

such terms also place restrictions on us with respect to the sale of assets  liens  investments  dividends  debt repayments  capital expenditures  transactions with affiliates  consolidation and mergers  and the issuance of equity interests  among other things 
our credit facility also requires compliance with financial tests based on financial position and results of operations  including a leverage ratio  an interest coverage ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio  all of which could effectively limit our ability to borrow under the credit facility or to otherwise raise funds in the debt market 
on march   we entered into an amendment with our lenders under our bank facility that modified the financial condition covenants to terms more favorable to us

subject to certain restrictions imposed our bank credit facility  we could finance the cash redemption of the high tides with borrowings under our bank credit facility  available free cash balances and or a new preferred and or common stock issuance 
by july  if we have not redeemed of our high tides for cash and or stock  we must remarket the high tides into a similar security priced at the then prevailing market prices for such a security 
as of the date of this report  we have not elected to redeem our high tides

goodwill and fcc licenses we have made acquisitions in the past for which a significant portion of the purchase price was allocated to goodwill  fcc licenses  and other identifiable intangible assets 
goodwill consists of the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible net assets acquired in purchase business combinations 
prior to january   goodwill and fcc licenses were amortized over a year period excluding the assets acquired from blue chip broadcasting  inc and sinclair telecable  inc  which were 
table of contents purchased after june  
commencing january   goodwill and fcc licenses are not amortized  but are tested annually for impairment at the reporting unit level 
in determining the realizability of our indefinite lived intangible assets  we value fcc licenses using a discounted cash flow analysis prepared by an independent third party valuation expert 
goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of a station s net assets over its carrying value 
impairment is the condition that exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
the implied fair value of goodwill is the amount determined by deducting the estimated fair value of all tangible and identifiable intangible net assets of the reporting unit from the estimated fair value of the reporting unit 
if the recorded value of goodwill exceeds its implied value  an impairment charge is recorded for the excess 
see also note to the consolidated financial statements of radio one impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements 
as of december   approximately of our total assets consisted of fcc licenses and goodwill  which are considered indefinite lived assets and are subject to an annual impairment test 
impairment of long lived assets excluding goodwill and fcc licenses long lived assets  excluding goodwill and fcc licenses  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be fully recoverable 
these events or changes in circumstances may include a significant deterioration of operating results  changes in business plans  or changes in anticipated future cash flows 
if an impairment indicator is present  we will evaluate recoverability by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets 
assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there is identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows generated by other asset groups 
if the assets are impaired  the impairment recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the assets 
fair value is generally determined by estimates of discounted cash flows 
the discount rate used in any estimate of discounted cash flows would be the rate required for a similar investment of like risk 
allowance for doubtful accounts we must make estimates of the uncollectibility of our accounts receivable 
we specifically review historical write off activity by market  large customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
if circumstances change  such as higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in an agency s ability to meet its financial obligation to us  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could change by a material amount 
revenue recognition we recognize and report revenue for broadcast advertising when the commercial is broadcast  net of agency commissions in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
agency commissions  when applicable  are calculated based on a stated percentage applied to gross billing 
generally  clients remit the gross billing amount to the agency and the agency remits the gross billing  less their commission  to us 
equity accounting we account for our investment in tv one under the equity method of accounting in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock 
we have recorded an investment in the partnership interest of tv one at cost and have adjusted the carrying amount of the investment to recognize the share of the losses of tv one after the date of the initial investment 
accordingly  we are recognizing our ratable share of tv one s net loss 
we will review the realizability of the investment if conditions are present or events occur to suggest that an impairment of the investment may exist 
we have determined that  although tv one is a variable interest entity as defined by financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
 we are not the primary beneficiary of tv one 

table of contents impact of inflation we believe that inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations for each of our fiscal years in the three year period ended december  however  there can be no assurance that future inflation would not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition 
seasonality seasonal net broadcast revenue fluctuations are common in the radio broadcasting industry and are due primarily to fluctuations in advertising expenditures by local and national advertisers 
our first fiscal quarter generally produces the lowest net broadcast revenue for the year 
capital and commercial commitments long term debt we have raised funds from the following issuances of long term debt in may  we closed a private offering of million of our senior subordinated notes due realizing net proceeds of million 
the net proceeds of the offering were primarily used to repay amounts owed on our bank credit facility and previously outstanding senior subordinated notes 
in july  we established various credit facilities under an agreement with a group of financial institutions whereby we may borrow up to million 
this agreement was subsequently amended on march  the amended and restated credit agreement to provide a new facility under which we may borrow up to million 
the bank credit facility consists of term a loans the loan in an amount up to million  and a credit line the revolver in an amount up to million that may be borrowed on a revolving basis 
the interest rate on the bank credit facility is libor plus a spread based on the company s leverage ratio  as defined in the credit agreement 
the credit facility requires quarterly interest payments 
the credit facility also requires minimum quarterly principal payments  which commenced march  the loans mature in june as of december   we had million outstanding on the loan and million remained available subject to various covenant restrictions to be drawn down from the revolver 
lease obligations we have non cancelable operating leases for office space  studio space  broadcast towers and transmitter facilities and non cancelable capital leases for equipment that expire over the next twenty years 
contractual obligations schedule the following table represents our contractual obligations as of december payments due by period in thousands contractual obligations and beyond total senior subordinated notes bank credit facility capital lease obligations dividends on preferred stock other operating contracts agreements operating lease obligations total 
table of contents the above amounts do not include interest  which in some cases is variable in amount 
other operating contracts agreements include employment contracts  severance obligations  on air talent contracts and other programming agreements 
in addition to the obligations above  as of december   we had swap agreements in place for a total notional amount of million 
the periods remaining on the swap agreements range in duration from six to months 
if we terminate our interest swap agreements before they expire  we will be required to pay early termination fees 
our credit exposure under these agreements is limited to the cost of replacing an agreement in the event of non performance by our counter party  however  we do not anticipate non performance 
we anticipate that we will fund our obligations and commitments with cash flow from operations 
risk factors our future operating results could be adversely affected by a number of risks and uncertainties  certain of which are described below 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may impair our business operations 
if any of the risks described below actually occur  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
in the future  we may have difficulty integrating the operations  systems and management of the stations we acquire 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to integrate successfully any operations  systems or management of stations we acquire in the future 
our failure to integrate and manage newly acquired stations successfully could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
in addition  in the event that the operations of a new station do not meet our expectations  we may restructure or write off the value of some portion of the assets of the new station 
we face many unpredictable business risks  both general and specific to the radio broadcasting industry  which could have a material adverse effect on our future operations 
our future operations are subject to many business risks  including those risks that specifically influence the radio broadcasting industry  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  including 
economic conditions  both generally and relative to the radio broadcasting industry  shifts in population  demographics or audience tastes  the level of competition for advertising revenues with other radio stations  satellite radio  television stations and other entertainment and communications media  technological changes and innovations  and changes in governmental regulations and policies and actions of federal regulatory bodies  including the department of justice  the federal trade commission and the federal communications commission 
given the inherent unpredictability of these variables  we cannot guarantee with any degree of certainty or predict what effect  if any  these variables will have on our future operations 
generally  advertising tends to decline during economic recession or downturn 
consequentially  our advertising revenue is likely to be adversely affected by a recession or downturn in the united states economy  the economy of an individual geographic market in which we own or operate radio stations  or other events or circumstances that adversely affect advertising activity 

table of contents the loss of key personnel  including on air talent  could disrupt the management and operations of our business 
our business depends upon the continued efforts  abilities and expertise of our executive officers  including our chief executive officer  chief financial officer  chief operating officer and general counsel  and other key employees  including on air personalities 
we believe that the unique combination of skills and experience possessed by our executive officers would be difficult to replace  and that the loss of any one of them could have a material adverse effect on us  including the impairment of our ability to execute our business strategy 
additionally  our radio stations employ or independently contract with several on air personalities and hosts of syndicated radio programs with significant loyal audiences in their respective broadcast areas 
these on air personalities are sometimes significantly responsible for the ranking of a station  and thus  the ability of the station to sell advertising 
we cannot be assured that these individuals will remain with our radio stations or will retain their current audiences 
two common stockholders have a majority voting interest in radio one and have the power to control matters on which radio one s common stockholders may vote  and their interests may conflict with yours 
as of march   our chairperson and her son  our chief executive officer ceo  collectively held approximately of the outstanding voting power of radio one s common stock 
as a result  our chairperson and the ceo will control most decisions involving radio one  including transactions involving a change of control of radio one  such as a sale or merger 
in addition  certain covenants in radio one s debt instruments and in the tv one operating agreement require that our chairperson and the ceo maintain specified ownership and voting interest in radio one  and prohibit other parties voting interests from exceeding specified amounts 
our chairperson and the ceo have agreed to vote their shares together in elections of members of the board of directors 
we must respond to the rapid changes in technology  services and standards which characterize our industry in order to remain competitive 
the radio broadcasting industry is subject to rapid technological change  evolving industry standards and the emergence of new media technologies  which may impact our business 
we cannot assure you that we will have the resources to acquire new technologies or to introduce new services that could compete with these new technologies 
several new media technologies are being developed  including the following audio programming by cable television systems  direct broadcast satellite systems  internet content providers and other digital audio broadcast formats  satellite delivered digital audio radio service  which has resulted in the introduction of several new satellite radio services with sound quality equivalent to that of compact discs  and in band on channel digital radio  which could provide multi channel  multi format digital radio services in the same bandwidth currently occupied by traditional am and fm radio services 
we program five channels on a satellite digital audio radio service  and also have invested in a developer of digital audio broadcast technology 
however  we cannot assure you that these arrangements will be successful or enable us to adapt effectively to these new media technologies 
we compete for advertising revenue against radio stations and other media  many of which have greater resources than we do  and if we are unable to maintain or grow our advertising revenue share  our business and operating results may be adversely affected 
in the competitive broadcasting industry  the success of each of our radio stations is primarily dependent upon its share of the overall advertising revenue within its market 
although we believe that each of our stations can compete effectively in its broadcast area  we cannot be sure that any of our stations can maintain or increase its current audience ratings or market share  or that advertisers will not decrease the amount they spend on advertising 

table of contents our advertising revenue may suffer if any of our stations cannot maintain its audience ratings or market share 
shifts in population  demographics  audience tastes and other factors beyond our control could cause us to lose market share 
our stations also compete for audiences and advertising revenues directly with other radio stations  and some of the owners of those competing stations have greater resources than we do 
if a competing station converts to a format similar to that of one of our stations  or if one of our competitors strengthens its operations  our stations could suffer a reduction in ratings and advertising revenue 
other radio companies  which are larger and have more resources may also enter markets in which we operate 
in addition  our stations also compete with other media such as broadcast and cable television  newspapers  magazines  direct mail  music videos  the internet and outdoor advertising  some of which may be controlled by horizontally integrated companies 
we also anticipate that our stations will compete with satellite based radio services  including sirius satellite radio and xm satellite radio 
we currently program five channels for xm satellite radio 
the terms of our debt restrict us from engaging in many activities and require us to satisfy various financial tests  and these restrictions may make it more difficult to pursue our acquisition strategy 
our bank credit facility and the agreements governing our other outstanding debt  including our senior subordinated notes  contain covenants that restrict  among other things  our ability to incur additional debt  pay cash dividends  purchase our capital stock  make capital expenditures  make investments or other restricted payments  swap or sell assets  engage in transactions with related parties  secure non senior debt with our assets  or merge  consolidate or sell all or substantially all of our assets 
our bank credit facility requires that we obtain our banks consent for acquisitions that do not meet specific criteria 
these restrictions may make it more difficult to pursue our acquisition strategy 
our bank credit facility also requires that we maintain specific financial ratios  which could be affected by events beyond our control 
the loans under our bank credit facility will be due in august and our senior subordinated notes will be due in july a breach of any of the covenants contained in our bank credit facility could allow our lenders to declare all amounts outstanding under our bank credit facility to be immediately due and payable and a breach of any of the covenants contained in the indenture covering our senior subordinated notes could allow the holders of those notes to declare the notes immediately due and payable 
in addition  our banks could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness 
if the amounts outstanding under our bank credit facility or payment of our senior subordinated notes are accelerated  our assets might not be sufficient to repay in full the money owed to the banks or to our other debt holders 
our substantial level of debt could limit our ability to grow and compete 
we have a substantial amount of debt  a portion of which bears interest at variable rates 
our substantial level of indebtedness could adversely affect us for various reasons  including limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  debt payments or other corporate purposes  have sufficient funds available for operations  future business opportunities or other purposes  compete with competitors that have less debt than we do  and react to changing market conditions  changes in our industry and economic downturns 
our business depends on maintaining our licenses with the fcc 
we could be prevented from operating a radio station if we fail to maintain its license 
radio broadcasters depend upon maintaining radio broadcasting licenses issued by the fcc 
these licenses are ordinarily issued for a maximum term of eight years and may be renewed 
our radio broadcasting licenses 
table of contents expire at various times from april  to february  see radio one s licenses above 
although we may apply to renew our fcc licenses  interested third parties may challenge our renewal applications 
in addition  if radio one or any of our stockholders  officers  or directors violates the fcc s rules and regulations or the communications act of  as amended  or is convicted of a felony  the fcc may commence a proceeding to impose sanctions upon us 
examples of possible sanctions include the imposition of fines  the renewal of one or more of our broadcasting licenses for a term of fewer than eight years or the revocation of our broadcast licenses 
if the fcc were to issue an order denying a license renewal application or revoking a license  we would be required to cease operating the radio station covered by the license only after we had exhausted administrative and judicial review without success 
the radio broadcasting industry is subject to extensive and changing federal regulation 
among other things  the communications act and fcc rules and policies limit the number of broadcasting properties that any person or entity may own directly or by attribution in any market and require fcc approval for transfers of control and assignments of licenses 
if the revised media ownership rules adopted by the fcc in june become effective  our ability to purchase or sell station groups could be restricted 
outside media interests of radio one officers and directors could also limit radio one s ability to acquire stations 
the filing of petitions or complaints against radio one or any fcc licensee from which we are acquiring a station could result in the fcc delaying the grant of  or refusing to grant or imposing conditions on its consent to the assignment or transfer of control of licenses 
the communications act and fcc rules and policies also impose limitations on non us ownership and voting of the capital stock of radio one 
demand for tv one s service may be insufficient for tv one to become profitable and we may lose our investment in tv one 
because tv one offers a new service  we cannot estimate with any certainty the potential consumer demand for such a service or the degree to which it will meet that demand 
among other things  consumer acceptance of tv one s service will depend upon whether tv one obtains  produces and markets high quality programming consistent with consumers taste  the willingness of cable networks to market and broadcast tv one programming  the willingness of consumers  on a mass market basis  to pay cable network fees to obtain tv one s service  and the marketing and broadcasting strategies that tv one employs and that are employed by its competitors 
if demand for tv one s service does not develop as expected  tv one may not be able to generate enough revenue to generate positive cash flow or become profitable  potentially resulting in a loss of our investment 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk both the revolving commitment and term loan borrowings under our credit facility bear interest  at our option  at a rate equal to either libor plus a spread that ranges from to or the prime rate plus a spread of up to  depending on our leverage ratio 
under the bank credit facility  we may be required from time to time to protect ourselves from interest rate fluctuations using interest rate hedge agreements 
we have entered into various fixed rate swap agreements designed to mitigate our exposure to higher floating interest rates 
these swap agreements require that we pay a fixed rate of interest on the notional amount to a bank and that bank pay to us a variable rate equal to three month libor 
as of december   we had swap agreements in place for a total notional amount of million 
the periods remaining on the swap agreements range in duration from six to months 
our credit exposure under these agreements is limited to the cost of replacing an agreement in the event of non performance by our counter party  however  we do not anticipate non performance 
all of the swap agreements are tied to the three month libor interest rate  which may fluctuate significantly on a daily basis 

table of contents the valuation of each of these swap agreements is affected by the change in the three month libor rates and the remaining term of the agreement 
any increase in the three month libor rate results in a more favorable valuation  while a decrease in the three month libor rate results in a less favorable valuation
