item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations following is management s discussion and analysis of significant factors that have affected the company s financial position and its results of operations for the periods presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
fiscal   and results all include weeks 
critical accounting policies the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in part iv  item of this form k 
the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to its revenue recognition policy  the carrying value of its merchandise inventories  the adequacy of its store closure reserves  and the valuation of its long lived assets and deferred tax assets 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
in the past  actual results have not been materially different from the company s estimates 
some of the company s significant accounting policies involve a higher degree of judgment or complexity than its other accounting policies 
the policies described below have been identified as critical to the company s business operations and the understanding of its results of operations 
the impact and associated risks related to these policies on the company s business operations are discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition policy net retail sales are recognized at the point of sale  net of estimated sales returns and allowances and exclusive of sales tax 
net retail sales also include all amounts billed to a customer in a sale transaction for shipping and handling  including customer delivery charges 
revenues on special order sales are recognized when the merchandise is delivered to the customer and the merchandise has been paid for in its entirety 
the company records an allowance for estimated sales returns in the period in which the related sale occurs 
these estimates are based primarily on historical sales returns 
if the historical data used to calculate these estimates does not properly reflect future returns  and adjustments to the allowance for estimated sales returns may be necessary 
inventory valuation merchandise inventory  which consists of merchandise held for resale  is valued at the lower of lifo last in  first out cost or market using the retail inventory method rim of accounting 
inherent in the rim calculation are various judgments and estimates including  among others  merchandise markon  markups  markdowns and shrinkage  which significantly impact the ending inventory valuation at cost  as well as resulting gross margins 
the company applies various methodologies to ensure that the application of the rim is consistent for all periods presented 
such methodologies include the development of consistent cost to retail ratios and the grouping of homogenous classes of merchandise 
estimated inventory shrinkage between physical inventory dates is based on historical experience 
should actual inventory shrinkage results differ from the company s estimate  year end revisions to inventory shrinkage expense recognized on an interim basis may be required 
estimating the market value of the company s merchandise inventory requires assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
such estimates are based on actual and forecasted sales trends  current inventory levels and aging information by merchandise categories 
the company records markdowns to value merchandise inventories at net realizable value 
if forecasted sales are not achieved  or if other indicators of impairment are present  additional markdowns may be needed in future periods to clear excess or slow moving merchandise  which may result in lower gross margins 
reserve for store closure costs in the event a store is closed before its lease has expired  the remaining lease obligation after the closing date less anticipated sublease rental income or proceeds from lease settlements  if any is expensed at the date the store ceases operations 
asset impairment charges related to furniture  fixtures and equipment  leasehold improvements  goodwill and leasehold interests are expensed in the period in which management adopts a plan to close the store if impairment is considered likely as a result of such planned closure  or at such other time as impairment becomes likely 
severance and other incremental costs associated with a store closure are expensed as incurred 
as of january   the company had a reserve for store closure costs totaling  which consisted primarily of estimated future lease obligations for one of the store locations closed in fiscal and one of the store locations closed in fiscal in the event the company is not successful in selling or subleasing the locations closed in fiscal as soon as management expects  additional reserves for store closure costs may be recorded 
in addition  in the event the company decides to close additional store locations in fiscal or beyond  additional reserves for store closure costs  which may be material  may be incurred 
impairment of long lived assets the company s long lived assets consist primarily of property and equipment  goodwill  leasehold interests and other long term assets 
long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
with respect to store locations  the company performs an evaluation of whether an impairment charge should be recorded whenever a store experiences unfavorable operating performance 
a store s assets are evaluated for impairment by comparing its estimated undiscounted cash flows over its estimated remaining lease term to its carrying value 
if the cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying value  a loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair value of the asset is recognized 
estimates of future cash flows are based on a variety of factors  including historical experience in similar locations  changes in merchandising  promotional or operating strategy that may affect the profitability of a particular location  knowledge of the market area and in some cases  expected sale proceeds or sublease income  and independent appraisals 
in addition  the analysis assumes that new store locations typically take three years to achieve their full profit potential 
various uncertainties  including but not limited to changes in consumer preferences  increased competition or a general deterioration in economic conditions could adversely impact the expected cash flows to be generated by an asset or group of assets 
in fiscal  the company recorded asset impairment charges in connection with store closures  and such charges are included in loss on store closures in the accompanying consolidated income statement 
in addition  asset impairment charges were recorded for certain underperforming store locations which continue to be operated 
if actual performance or fair value estimates for other locations are less favorable than management s projections  future asset impairment charges may be necessary 
similar procedures are used when analyzing other corporate assets for impairment 
effective the beginning of fiscal  the provisions of sfas no 
were implemented 
as a result  the company no longer amortizes previously recorded goodwill 
the company performs an annual impairment review of goodwill as required by the statement  unless more frequent reviews are warranted by specific events or circumstances 
there can be no assurance that at the time these reviews are completed that material impairment charges will not be recorded 
income taxes the carrying value of the company s net deferred tax assets assumes that the company will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the value of these assets 
in determining the appropriate valuation allowance  management considers all available evidence for certain tax credit  net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards that would likely expire prior to their utilization 
management believes it is more likely than not that the company will generate sufficient future taxable income in the appropriate carryforward periods to realize the benefit of its remaining net deferred tax assets 
however  if the available evidence were to change in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance may be required  resulting in additional income tax expense 
accounting for the securitization and sale of receivables prior to the sale of its customer credit card accounts and accounts receivable to household on january   the company conveyed all of the receivables generated under its private label customer credit cards to a wholly owned subsidiary  gcrc  on a daily basis 
those receivables that met certain eligibility requirements of the program were simultaneously conveyed to the gottschalks credit card master trust gcc trust to be used as collateral for securities issued to investors 
gcc trust was a qualified special purpose entity and was not consolidated in the company s financial statements 
the transfers of such receivables were accounted for as sales for financial reporting purposes pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for the transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  and as such  the transferred receivables were removed from the company s balance sheet at the time of the transfer 
the company retained a beneficial ownership interest in certain of the receivables transferred under the program and also retained an uncertificated ownership interest in the retained interest to future interest income interest only strip and other receivables that did not meet certain eligibility requirements of the program 
the retained interests and the interest only strips were carried at their estimated fair values  which were estimated based upon the present value of the expected future cash flows  calculated using management s best estimates of key assumptions about anticipated credit losses  account prepayment speeds  discount rates and other factors necessary to derive an estimate of fair values 
the gain or loss on the sale of the receivables was calculated by comparing the carrying amount of the financial assets involved in the transfer to their relative fair values at the date of transfer 
the certificated portion of the retained interests were considered readily marketable and were classified as available for sale and carried at their estimated fair values in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated certain items from the company s consolidated statements of operations  expressed as a percent of net sales fiscal years net sales net credit revenues net leased department revenues total revenues costs and expenses cost of sales selling  general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization asset impairment charges store closure costs receivables sale costs total costs and expenses operating income other income expense interest expense losses on early extinguishment of debt miscellaneous income income loss before income taxes income tax expense benefit income loss from continuing operations discontinued operations income loss from operation of closed stores loss on store closures income tax benefit loss on discontinued operations net income loss fiscal compared to fiscal net sales net sales from continuing operations decreased by approximately million  or  to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal the fiscal sales decrease is primarily attributable to continued downturn in the general economic environment in much of the company s market areas resulting in lower consumer spending during the first half of the fiscal period 
comparable store sales for fiscal  which includes sales for stores open for the full period in both years  decreased by as compared to the same week period of the prior year 
the company operated department stores and specialty stores as of the end of fiscal as compared to department stores and specialty stores as of the end of fiscal as described more fully in note to the accompanying financial statements  during fiscal the company closed six department stores 
two such stores were closed in february  and one store was closed in each of march  april  july and january during fiscal the company closed two stores in each of june and january net credit revenues as described more fully in note to the accompanying financial statements  in january  pursuant to the terms of a purchase and sale agreement between the company and household bank sb na household  the company sold its private label credit card accounts and accounts receivable to household 
in connection with the sale  the company entered into two additional agreements with household an interim servicing agreement the isa and a credit card program agreement the cca 
under the terms of the isa  the company continued to service the credit card receivables until household assumed their servicing on may   as planned 
household compensated the company for providing the services during the interim servicing period 
the cca provides that the company will be paid a percentage of net cardholder charges and a percentage of other revenue each as defined in the cca 
all amounts received under the cca  including amortization of prepaid program revenue  are reflected in the table below as service charge revenues 
in connection with the sale  the company also terminated its receivables securitization program 
as a result  net credit revenues related to the company s credit card receivables portfolio decreased by approximately million or  to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal as a percent of net sales  net credit revenues were of net sales in fiscal as compared to in fiscal net credit revenues consist of the following in thousands service charge revenues   interim servicing compensation net  amortization of interest only strip interest expense on securitized receivables  charge offs on receivables sold and provision for credit losses on receivables ineligible for sale  gain on sale of receivables the interim servicing compensation amount represents servicing fees under the isa attributable to general corporate activities that were not offset by direct costs of servicing the portfolio during the interim period 
these revenues ceased at the end of the interim servicing period on may  in connection with the sale of the receivables  on january   the company recorded a  interest only strip that was amortized over the estimated life of the underlying assets sold approximately five months 
the interest only strip represented the portion of the initial revenues under the cca that is considered a residual interest in the assets sold 
the interest only strip has been fully amortized 
as expected  the company experienced a substantial decrease in net credit revenues in fiscal as a result of the receivables sale to household  as well as a reduction in selling  general and administrative expenses as a result of outsourcing the credit card servicing to household and a reduction in interest expense arising from reduced line of credit borrowings resulting from the application of the proceeds from the household transaction 
as a result  the net credit revenues the company receives under the cca approximately equals the net revenues from its former in house credit card operations  net of operating expenses and interest expense 
net leased department revenues net rental income generated by the company s various leased departments decreased by approximately million  or  to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal this decrease is primarily due a continued downturn in the general economic environment in much of the company s market areas resulting in lower consumer spending during the first three quarters of the fiscal year 
leased department sales are presented net of the related costs for financial reporting purposes 
sales generated in the company s leased departments  consisting primarily of fine jewelry departments and beauty salons  totaled million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal cost of sales cost of sales from continuing operations  which includes costs associated with the buying  handling and distribution of merchandise  decreased by approximately million to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal  a decrease of 
the dollar decrease is primarily due to the decrease in sales volume 
the company s gross margin percentage increased to in fiscal as compared to in fiscal the increase in the gross margin percentage was primarily due to a change in accounting for certain allowances received from vendors as a result of the company s adoption of emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
accounting by a customer including a reseller for cash consideration received from a vendor that previously would have been reported as reductions in advertising expense  in addition to lower markdowns as a percentage of sales as compared to the prior year 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses from continuing operations decreased by approximately million  or  to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to in fiscal as compared to in fiscal the dollar decrease is primarily attributable to the elimination of the in house credit card operations in connection with the sale of receivables to household and cost reduction efforts initiated throughout all areas of the company  particularly in the areas of payroll and related fringe benefits  reduced advertising expenditures resulting from an increased reliance on more effective targeted marketing efforts partially offset by the change in accounting for certain allowances previously mentioned  and reduced communications costs 
such cost savings were partially offset by increased professional fees and insurance costs 
the company is continuing to implement programs aimed at reducing operating costs throughout all areas of the company 
although the company anticipates it will be successful in achieving its cost reduction initiatives  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to fully offset the impact of increases in certain of these costs in the future 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense  which includes the amortization accretion of intangible assets other than goodwill decreased by approximately million or  to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal as a percent of net sales  depreciation and amortization expense was in fiscal and fiscal the dollar decrease is primarily the result of impairment charges taken during fiscal related to certain underperforming stores  partially offset by additional depreciation related to information systems placed in service during and capital expenditures for the renovation and expansion of certain existing stores 
asset impairment charges no asset impairment charges related to continuing operations were recorded during fiscal during fiscal  the company recorded non cash asset impairment charges of million to write down long lived assets related to certain underperforming stores that the company continues to operate  primarily former lamonts locations 
these charges consisted of million of property and equipment  million of leasehold interests and million of goodwill 
the charges were determined by comparing projected net operating cash flows  including estimated proceeds from the sale of certain assets  to the carrying value of the stores long lived assets 
receivables sale costs in connection with the sale of accounts receivable to household in fiscal  the company recorded receivable sale transaction costs of million including consulting  legal  and other fees  and the net non cash write off of the remaining accounts of gcrc 
these charges are partially offset by a million retained interest only strip that was amortized over the estimated life of the underlying assets sold estimated to be approximately five months 
the interest only strip represents the portion of the initial program fees to be paid that is considered a residual interest in the assets sold 
interest expense interest expense  which includes the amortization of deferred financing costs  decreased by approximately million to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal  a decrease of 
as a percent of net sales  interest expense decreased to in fiscal as compared to in fiscal these decreases are primarily due to lower outstanding borrowings on the company s revolving credit facility as a result of the sale of the receivables to household 
the weighted average interest rate applicable to the facility was in fiscal as compared to in fiscal interest expense related to securitized receivables is reflected as a reduction of net credit revenues and is not included in interest expense for financial reporting purposes 
losses on early extinguishment of debt in fiscal  in connection with the termination of its receivables securitization program  the company recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of million representing prepayment penalties and the write off of unamortized deferred loan fees related to the program 
miscellaneous income miscellaneous income  which includes the amortization of deferred income and other miscellaneous income and expense amounts  increased by approximately million to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal as a percent of net sales  miscellaneous income was in fiscal and fiscal this increase was primarily due to an increase in the net income of the partnership which owns the company s corporate headquarters building 
the company has a interest in the partnership and accounts for its investment using the equity method of accounting

income from continuing operations as a result of the foregoing  the company reported income from continuing operations of million  or per diluted share  in fiscal as compared to a net loss of million  or per diluted share  in fiscal discontinued operations as described more fully in note to the accompanying financial statements  during fiscal the company closed six store locations 
during fiscal the company closed four store locations 
these stores were determined to be either underperforming or inconsistent with the company s long term operating strategy 
the net loss from operating these stores was million in fiscal and million in fiscal the loss from operation of discontinued stores consists of the following in thousands net sales from closed stores   cost of sales   selling  general and administrative expenses   depreciation and amortization total costs and expenses   loss from operations of closed stores  net costs associated with the closure of stores totaled million in fiscal primarily consisting of lease termination costs  severance  and other incremental costs associated with the store closings 
net costs associated with the closure of stores totaled million in fiscal consisting of lease termination costs  severance and other incremental costs associated with the store closings of approximately million and non cash asset impairment charges related to stores closed in fiscal and fiscal of million  partially offset by a gain of million from the sale of lease rights and fixtures and equipment related to two of the closed locations 
certain of the company s remaining stores have continued to perform below expectations 
in the event the company is unable to improve the operating performance of such underperforming stores  the company may consider the sale  sublease or closure of those stores in the future 
in the past  the company has successfully improved the operating results and cash flows of underperforming stores through a variety of strategies  including revising the merchandise mix  changing store management  revising marketing strategies  renegotiating lease agreements and reducing operating costs 
however  there can be no assurance that these strategies will improve the operating results and cash flows of the remaining underperforming stores  or that the company will be able to sell  sublease or close those stores in the event their performance does not improve 
in addition  the company may incur certain costs and expenses in connection with the sale or closure of those locations that may not be fully offset by sale proceeds  sublease income or favorable lease terminations 
net income as a result of the foregoing  the company reported net income of million in fiscal as compared to a net loss of million in fiscal on a per diluted share basis the net income was per share as compared to net loss of per share in fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal net sales net sales from continuing operations decreased by approximately million  or  to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal the fiscal sales decrease is primarily attributable to the closure of six stores in fiscal and to a continued downturn in the general economic environment in many of the company s market areas resulting in lower consumer spending 
results of operations of the fiscal store closures are included in continuing operations in the accompanying statement of operations 
sales related to those stores were million in fiscal comparable store sales for fiscal  which includes sales for stores open for the full period in both years  decreased by as compared to the same week period of the prior year

the dollar decrease is primarily due to the decrease in sales volume 
the company s gross margin percentage increased to in fiscal as compared to in fiscal the increase in the gross margin percentage was primarily due to lower markdowns as a percentage of sales as compared to the prior year 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses from continuing operations decreased by approximately million  or  to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to in fiscal as compared to in fiscal the dollar decrease is primarily attributable to realized benefits from cost reduction efforts and store closures  partially offset by increases in health care  workers compensation and property and casualty insurance costs

these increases were partially offset by the discontinuance of goodwill amortization as a result of the implementation of sfas no 
effective the beginning of fiscal  the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 
as a result  goodwill is no longer amortized and instead is evaluated for impairment annually  or at any time certain indicators of impairment arise 
the amortization of goodwill totaled million in fiscal the company will continue to amortize leasehold interests over their estimated lease terms 
asset impairment charges during  the company recorded non cash asset impairment charges of million to write down long lived assets related to certain underperforming stores  primarily former lamonts locations 
these charges consisted of million of property and equipment  million of leasehold interests and million of goodwill

interest expense interest expense  which includes the amortization of deferred financing costs  increased by approximately million to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal  an increase of 
as a percent of net sales  interest expense increased to in fiscal as compared to in fiscal these increases are primarily due to amortization of higher deferred financing costs relating to long term financings entered into in the fourth quarter of fiscal and the first three quarters of fiscal  and to an amendment fee relating to the company s revolving credit facility 
these increases were partially offset by lower average outstanding borrowings on the company s working capital facility

miscellaneous income miscellaneous income  which includes the amortization of deferred income and other miscellaneous income and expense amounts  increased by approximately million to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal as a percent of net sales  miscellaneous income increased to in fiscal as compared to in fiscal the dollar increase primarily relates to recoveries of prior interest charges arising from the partial settlement of certain net operating loss carryback claims  partially offset by charges to the company s partnership investment in its corporate offices related to the partnership s implementation of sfas no 
income taxes the company s effective tax rate for continuing operations is a benefit of in fiscal as compared to an expense of in fiscal including the tax benefit reported in discontinued operations  the company s effective tax rate is a benefit of in fiscal as compared to an expense of in fiscal the fiscal tax benefit includes million arising from the realization of net operating loss carryback claims 
income from continuing operations as a result of the foregoing  the company reported a net loss from continuing operations of million  or per diluted share  in fiscal as compared to net income from continuing operations of million  or per diluted share  in fiscal discontinued operations as described more fully in note to the accompanying financial statements  during fiscal the company closed six store locations 
during fiscal the company closed four store locations 
these stores were determined to be either underperforming or inconsistent with the company s long term operating strategy 
the net loss from operating these stores was million in fiscal and million in fiscal the loss from operation of discontinued stores consists of the following in thousands net sales from closed stores   net lease department revenues total revenues   cost of sales   selling  general and administrative expenses   depreciation and amortization total costs and expenses   loss from operations of closed stores   net costs associated with the closure of stores totaled million in fiscal consisting of lease termination costs  severance and other incremental costs associated with the store closings of approximately million and non cash asset impairment charges related to stores closed in fiscal and fiscal of million  partially offset by a gain of million from the sale of lease rights and fixtures and equipment related to two of the closed locations 
as previously noted  results of operations of the fiscal store closures are included in continuing operations in the accompanying statement of operations 
store closure costs related to fiscal store closures are reported separately in continuing operations in the accompanying statement of operations 
certain of the company s remaining stores have continued to perform below expectations 
in the event the company is unable to improve the operating performance of such underperforming stores  the company may consider the sale  sublease or closure of those stores in the future 
in the past  the company has successfully improved the operating results and cash flows of underperforming stores through a variety of strategies  including revising the merchandise mix  changing store management  revising marketing strategies  renegotiating lease agreements and reducing operating costs 
however  there can be no assurance that these strategies will improve the operating results and cash flows of the remaining underperforming stores  or that the company will be able to sell  sublease or close those stores in the event their performance does not improve 
in addition  the company may incur certain costs and expenses in connection with the sale or closure of those locations that may not be fully offset by sale proceeds  sublease income or favorable lease terminations 
net income as a result of the foregoing  the company reported a loss of million in fiscal as compared to net income of million in fiscal on a per share basis basic and diluted  the net loss was per share as compared to net income of per share in fiscal liquidity and capital resources the company s working capital requirements are currently met through a combination of cash provided by operations  borrowings under its senior revolving credit facility  short term trade and factor credit and by proceeds from external financings and sale transactions 
as described more fully below and in note to the consolidated financial statements  on january  the company sold its credit card accounts and accounts receivable to household 
proceeds from the sale were used to reduce the company s debt  including off balance sheet securitization obligations  by over million 
at the closing date  the company s availability under its revolving credit facility increased by approximately million and the company experienced increases in availability from million to million during fiscal as compared to fiscal availability was million as of january  as of march   the company re negotiated its senior revolving credit facility 
the ge facility provides for borrowings of up to million and has been extended through february   from the previous expiration of january  the ge facility provides for lower rates of interest than the previous credit facility and refinanced an existing real estate loan  which also has resulted in lower interest costs to the company 
in addition  the ge facility reduced the number of financial covenants to one fixed charge covenant 
as a result  the company expects improvements in availability to continue and believes its liquidity position after the sale of the receivables and the re negotiation of the revolving credit facility is substantially improved in comparison to prior years 
in fiscal  the company generated a total of million from operations as compared to million positive cash flow from operations in fiscal the increase is primarily due to a further reduction in inventory levels in fiscal related to store closures and adjustments in stock to more optimal levels 
the positive effects of these inventory reductions on cash flows from operations were partially offset by reductions in certain accrued expenses  primarily related to amounts due household during the company s interim servicing of the accounts receivable  and payments for certain worker s compensation reserves 
as described more fully below  recent efforts to improve the company s liquidity position have included the following the sale of receivables to household  ii refinancing the company s revolving credit facility  which was successfully completed on february  and subsequently amended to more favorable terms on march   iii restoring trade and factor credit  iv selling  subleasing or closing underperforming stores  v completing other financing and sale transactions  and vi reducing operating costs 
sources of liquidity sale of receivables on january   pursuant to the terms of a purchase and sale agreement between the company and household  the company sold substantially all of its private label credit card accounts and the related accounts receivable to household 
the million purchase price was paid in cash at closing  million of which was allocated to the purchase of such credit card accounts and receivables and million of which comprised prepaid program revenue 
proceeds from the sale were used to pay in full million principal and accrued interest due to the series and series certificateholders under the company s accounts receivable securitization program plus million in prepayment penalties 
the remaining proceeds of million and million of cash remaining on deposit in certain bank accounts relating to the securitization was released to the company at closing 
all of the million released to the company was applied as a reduction of outstanding borrowings under the company s revolving credit facility 
as a result  the company s availability under the credit line increased by million at the closing date and the company experienced increases in availability from million to million during fiscal as compared to fiscal availability was million as of january  in connection with the sale  on january  the company entered into two additional agreements with household an interim servicing agreement the isa and a credit card program agreement the cca 
under the terms of the isa  the company continued to service the credit card receivables until household assumed the servicing on may  household compensated the company for providing the services during the interim servicing period 
the cca sets forth the terms and conditions under which household will issue credit cards to the company s customers and pay the company for sales made on the cards 
under the terms of the cca  the company is required to perform certain duties  including the duties to receive in store customer payments on behalf of household and remit such payments to household 
the cca has a term of five years and is cancelable earlier by either party under certain circumstances  as described in the cca 
the cca further provides that the company will be paid a percentage of net cardholder charges and a percentage of other revenue each as defined in the cca 
as expected  the company experienced a substantial decrease in net credit revenues in fiscal as a result of the receivables sale to household  as well as a reduction in selling  general and administrative expenses as a result of outsourcing the credit card servicing to household and a reduction in interest expense arising from reduced line of credit borrowings resulting from the application of the proceeds from the household transaction 
as a result  the net credit revenues the company receives under the cca approximately equals the net credit revenues from its former in house credit card operations  net of operating expenses and interest expense  although no assurances can be given that the amounts received under the cca will continue at these levels or at all 
senior secured credit facility on february   the company entered into a three year senior revolving credit facility with general electric capital corporation ge capital as agent  and the cit group business credit as syndication agent the original ge facility 
on march   subsequent to the company s fiscal year end  the company finalized an amendment and restatement of the original ge facility the ge facility 
as of january   outstanding borrowings under the original ge facility totaled million  and excess borrowing availability under the facility  after the deduction of the minimum availability requirement and other reserves  totaled million 
the company classified a total of million and million as of january  and february   respectively  as long term in the accompanying financial statements  representing that portion of outstanding borrowings under the facility which are not expected to be repaid within one year of the respective balance sheet dates 
substantially all of the company s assets  including its merchandise inventories  were pledged to ge capital under this facility 
as of january   interest charged on amounts borrowed under the tranche a portion of the original ge facility were at the prime rate plus per annum at january   or at the company s option  at the applicable libor rate plus per annum at january  
in addition  the company paid an unused commitment fee equal to per annum on the average unused daily balance of the tranche a facility 
amounts borrowed under the tranche b portion of the original ge facility bore interest at prime plus  or at the company s option  at libor plus 
beginning in fiscal  the interest rate applicable to the tranche a portion was adjusted upwards or downwards on a quarterly basis based on a pricing matrix which was tied to the company s leverage ratio as defined in the agreement 
under the pricing matrix  the applicable interest rate could range from a rate as low as prime  or libor plus  to as high as prime plus  or libor plus 
the original ge facility contained restrictive financial and operating covenants  including the requirement to maintain a minimum twelve month trailing ebitda and a minimum accounts payable to inventory ratio 
in addition  the original ge facility also did not permit the repayment of the subordinated note on its scheduled maturity date of august   which resulted in the maturity of that note automatically being extended to august  as of january   management believes the company was in compliance with all restrictive financial covenants applicable to the original ge facility 
as previously noted  subsequent to the company s fiscal year end on march   the company finalized an amendment and restatement of the original ge facility 
the ge facility provides up to million of working capital financing and is extended through february   with an option to extend the facility through february   for a limited time and under certain conditions 
the ge facility consists of a revolving credit facility of up to million including a million letter of credit sub facility and a fully funded fixed term loan of million 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility are limited to the sum of a specified percentages of eligible credit card receivables  which are considered cash equivalents  and b the lesser of specified percentages of i the cost of eligible inventory and ii the net recovery value of the inventory  as determined by periodic valuation performed by an independent appraiser 
such borrowings are further limited by a requirement to maintain a minimum of million of excess availability at all times  and other reserves that are in effect 
substantially all of the company s assets  including its merchandise inventories  continue to be pledged to ge capital under the ge facility 
as of march   interest charged on amounts borrowed under the ge facility for revolving loans were at the prime rate plus per annum at march   or at the company s option  at the applicable libor rate plus per annum at march  
in addition  the company pays an unused commitment fee equal to per annum on the average unused daily balance of the tranche a facility 
amounts borrowed under the term loan portion of the ge facility bear interest at per annum 
the interest rate applicable to the revolving loans under the ge facility may be adjusted upwards or downwards on a quarterly basis based on a pricing matrix which is tied to the company s borrowing availability 
under the pricing matrix  the applicable interest rate could range from a rate as low as prime  or libor plus  to as high as prime plus  or libor plus 
on march   the company had entered into a million financing with kimco capital corp 
the kimco facility at a fixed interest rate of per annum 
the kimco facility was secured by first priority liens on three of the company s owned stores and with subordinate liens on substantially all other assets of the company securing the original ge facility 
proceeds from the kimco facility were used to repay previously existing mortgage loans on two of those properties and one term loan and to pay certain fees and costs associated with the transaction 
the remaining million of proceeds was used to reduce outstanding borrowings under the original ge facility 
the kimco facility was co terminus with the original ge facility  with monthly principal payments of  plus interest at a fixed rate of per annum  and a balloon payment upon maturity on january  of million 
in march  the company prepaid the remaining million balance of the kimco facility including a prepayment penalty  and other transaction fees and costs with borrowings under the ge facility 
the term loan under the ge facility is collateralized by two of the three owned stores previously securing the kimco facility 
the ge facility contains restrictive financial and operating covenants  including the requirement to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of as defined in the agreement 
the ge facility also does not permit the repayment of the subordinated note  and accordingly the scheduled maturity date of the subordinated note has been extended to may  trade credit and transactions with affiliate the success of the company s business is highly dependent upon the adequacy of trade credit offered by key factors and vendors  the vendors ability and willingness to sell it products at favorable prices and terms  and the willingness of vendors to ship merchandise on a timely basis 
restrictions to the amount of trade credit granted by key factors and vendors can adversely impact the volume of merchandise the company is able to purchase 
any significant reduction in the volume of merchandise the company is able to purchase  or a prolonged disruption in the timing of when merchandise is received  would have a material adverse affect on the company s business  liquidity position  and results of operations 
the company began to experience a significant reduction in the level of unsecured credit offered by many of its factors and vendors in late fiscal on february   the level of unsecured credit offered by vendors increased  but unsecured credit granted by key factors  which can represent over of total trade credit granted to the company  remained restricted 
management negotiated the restoration of partially secured credit lines with certain key factors by issuing standby letters of credit 
certain of those letters of credit were collateralized by the harris letter of credit  which is described below 
the issuance of those letters of credit reduced the company s borrowing availability under its revolving line of credit 
in order to offset the majority of this availability reduction  harris  an affiliate of the company  agreed to provide a short term credit enhancement to the revolving line of credit under the terms of the cfa entered into with the company on february  during  the cfa was amended three times to provide for extensions of the expiration date of the harris letter of credit 
under the terms of the third amendment to the cfa  the harris letter of credit was cancelled and the cfa was terminated as a result of the closing of the sale of receivables to household 
nevertheless  the company has been able to purchase an adequate level of merchandise to support its operations to date 
upon the completion of the receivables sale to household  the company s largest factor significantly increased its unsecured credit line and substantially all of the company s major unfactored suppliers increased their credit lines to historical levels 
as a result of continued improvements in the company s operations and liquidity position  including the march  renegotiation of the ge facility  all of the letters of credit issued for the benefit of certain key factors have been allowed to expire and credit lines continue to increase with all of the company s key factors and many of the company s unfactored suppliers 
nonetheless  there can be no assurance the company will continue to receive an adequate level of key factor and vendor trade credit to support its operations 
any significant reductions of trade and factor support may impair the company s ability to purchase an adequate level of merchandise to support its operations 
the inability to purchase an adequate level of merchandise would have a material adverse affect on the company s business  liquidity position and results of operations 
other financings on february   the company completed a million  seven year term loan financing of its corporate aircraft 
on may   the company completed the financing of its ownership interest in the partnership that owns the company s corporate headquarters building 
proceeds from this transaction  totaling million  were used to reduce outstanding borrowings under the original ge facility 
the related note payable bears interest at a variable rate of prime plus per annum  which is payable monthly 
the million principal portion of the note payable is due in full upon maturity on may  the company may consider various other sources of liquidity in the future  including but not limited to the issuance of additional securities that might have a dilutive effect on existing shareholders or incurring additional indebtedness which would increase the company s leverage 
uses of liquidity the company s primary uses of liquidity are for working capital  debt service requirements and capital expenditures 
capital expenditures in fiscal  totaling million  were primarily related to information system enhancements and the renovation  refixturing  and expansion of certain existing locations 
the company presently has no commitments to open or remodel any stores in fiscal as of january   the company had issued a total of million of standby letters of credit and documentary letters of credit totaling million 
the standby letters of credit were issued to secure credit lines with key factors and to provide collateral for a workers compensation insurance policy 
as previously mentioned subsequent to january  the factor letters of credit have all been allowed to expire on their respective expiration dates 
management believes that the likelihood of any draws under the remaining workers compensation standby letters of credit is remote 
documentary letters of credit are issued in the ordinary course of business to facilitate the purchase of merchandise from overseas suppliers 
the supplier draws against the documentary letter of credit upon delivery of the merchandise 
contractual obligations the following tables set forth certain information concerning the company s debt obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts  such as debt and lease agreements  and under contingent commitments

million of contractual obligations originally due in fiscal were early terminated on march  in connection with the amendment of the company s revolving credit facility  the term of the subordinated note was extended to may purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
agreements that are cancelable without penalty have been excluded 
purchase obligations relate primarily to service and maintenance agreements and information technology contracts 
represents outstanding borrowings under the company s senior revolving credit facility as of january  such commitment was extended from its original date of january   on march  
the table presents that amount as due at february   the end of the commitment period for the facility 
cash generated by operations  together with liquidity provided by the ge facility  the cca and other financial resources  including without limitation the factors described below  are expected to adequately finance the company s planned cash requirements for fiscal however  the company s actual results may differ from the expectations set forth in the preceding sentence 
the company s liquidity and capital resources may be affected by a number of factors and risks many of which are beyond the control of the company  including but not limited to the availability of adequate borrowing capacity and the ability to maintain compliance with restrictive debt covenants contained in the company s senior revolving credit facility and its other debt obligations  adequate cash flows generated by operations  and the adequacy of factor and trade credit 
because the company is already highly leveraged  the ability to obtain additional or alternative sources of financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  new store openings  acquisitions and other general corporate purposes is limited 
if the estimates or assumptions relative to any one of these sources of liquidity are not realized  or if those sources of liquidity become significantly reduced  the company s liquidity position  financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 
recently issued accounting standards in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
this statement requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset 
the company adopted sfas no 
effective the beginning of fiscal and its adoption did not have a significant effect on the company s financial position or its results of operations 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
sfas no 
 among other things  eliminates the prior requirement that all gains and losses from the early extinguishment of debt were to be classified as an extraordinary item 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 gains and losses from the early extinguishment of debt are now classified as an extraordinary item only if they meet the unusual and infrequent criteria contained in accounting principles board opinion apbo no 
in addition  upon adoption of sfas no 
 all gains and losses from the early extinguishment of debt that had previously been classified as an extraordinary item are to be reassessed to determine if they would have met the unusual and infrequent criteria of apbo no 
any such gain or loss that would not have met the apbo no 
criteria is retroactively reclassified and reported as a component of income before extraordinary item 
the company has determined that its previously recognized loss from the early extinguishment of debt that occurred in fiscal would not have met the apbo no 
criteria for classification as an extraordinary item  and accordingly such previously reported loss from the early extinguishment of debt has been retroactively reclassified and is now reported as a component of income before income taxes 
the company has also determined that the fiscal loss from the early extinguishment of debt does not meet the apbo no 
criteria for extraordinary item classification  and accordingly such loss is reported as a component of income before income taxes 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which addresses accounting for restructuring and similar costs 
sfas no 
supersedes previous accounting guidance  principally emerging issues task force issue no 
sfas no 
requires that the liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
under issue  a liability for an exit cost was recognized at the date of the company s commitment to an exit plan 
sfas no 
also establishes that the liability should initially be measured and recorded at fair value 
accordingly  sfas no 
may affect the timing of recognizing future restructuring costs as well as the amounts recognized 
adoption of the provisions of sfas no 
for restructuring activities initiated after december  did not have a material impact on the company s financial position or its results of operations 
during  the emerging issues task force reached a consensus on issue no 
 accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor 
under the new guidance  if the consideration received represents a payment for assets delivered to the vendor  it should be classified as revenue 
if the consideration is a reimbursement of a specific  incremental  identifiable cost incurred in selling the vendor s product  the cost should be characterized as a reduction of that incurred cost 
generally  all other cash consideration received from a vendor should be classified as a reduction of cost of sales 
as required  the company adopted this guidance during fiscal and its adoption had no material impact on the company s sales  results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
inflation although inflation has not been a material factor in the company s operations during the past several years  the company has experienced increases in the costs of certain merchandise  salaries  employee benefits and other general and administrative costs  including utilities  health care and workers compensation and property and casualty insurance costs 
the company is generally able to offset these increases by adjusting its selling prices or by modifying its operations 
the company s ability to adjust selling prices is limited by competitive pressures in its market areas 
the company values its merchandise inventories at the lower of lifo cost or market using the retail inventory method of accounting 
under the lifo method  which is determined by using the department store price indices published by the bureau of labor statistics  the cost of products sold reported in the financial statements approximates current costs and thus reduces the impact of inflation due to increasing costs on reported income 
the valuation of the company s merchandise inventories under the lifo method is currently equal to that as determined by the first in  first out fifo method of accounting 
seasonality the company s business  like that of most retailers  is subject to seasonal influences  with the major portion of net sales  gross profit and operating income realized during the christmas selling months of november and december of each year  and  to a lesser extent  during the easter and back to school selling seasons 
the company s results may also vary from quarter to quarter as a result of  among other things  the timing and level of the company s sales promotions  weather  fashion trends and the overall health of the economy  both nationally and in the company s market areas 
working capital requirements also fluctuate during the year  increasing substantially prior to the christmas selling season when the company must carry significantly higher inventory levels 
the following table sets forth unaudited quarterly results of operations for fiscal and in thousands  except per share data

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risks in the normal course of business due to changes in interest rates on short term borrowings under its senior revolving credit facility 
as of january   the company also had one term loan bearing variable interest rates 
the company does not engage in financial transactions for speculative or trading purposes  nor does the company purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments 
as of january   borrowings subject to a variable interest rate  represented of the company s total outstanding borrowings 
the interest payable on the company s senior revolving credit facility is based on variable interest rates and is therefore affected by changes in market interest rates 
an increase of basis points on existing floating rate borrowings a change from the company s weighted average interest rate as of january  would reduce the company s pre tax net income and cash flow by approximately million 
this basis point increase in interest rates would not materially affect the fair value of the company s fixed rate financial instruments
