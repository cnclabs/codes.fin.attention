overview we are the global leader in providing an enterprise operating system and related systems management services based on open source technology for the information technology infrastructure requirements of large enterprises 
open source software is an alternative to proprietary software 
there are no licensing fees associated with open source software 
therefore  we do not recognize any separate distinguishable value from the sale of the code itself 
we derive the value from the sale of our open source solutions by the value we add through the integration and testing of red hat enterprise linux  guarantee of the levels of performance of red hat enterprise linux and rapid innovation of red hat enterprise linux in a method that allows this innovation to be consumed by our customers 
in addition  we provide certain managed services for each of our technologies through red hat network  a standard component of our subscriptions 
we sell our technology through subscriptions to red hat enterprise linux rhel and we recognize our technology based revenue over the period of the technology subscription agreements with our customers 
our products and services are offered primarily to large enterprises  government organizations  and small and medium size businesses 
during the fiscal year ended february   we restructured our organization to sharpen our focus on linux migration opportunities and to increase the amount of revenue that we generate from our enterprise technologies 
the restructuring included significant charges and the discontinuing of our network consulting business that was completed in february we have focused on introducing and gaining acceptance for our enterprise technologies  red hat enterprise linux as  es and ws and red hat network for the past two fiscal years 
in may  we introduced our initial red hat enterprise linux offering  red hat enterprise linux as  formerly called advanced server 
since its initial introduction  red hat enterprise linux has gained widespread isv and ihv support 
we have continued to focus on our enterprise line of technologies by expanding our enterprise operating platform offerings and introducing new systems management services 
as discussed in our critical accounting policies below  these new offerings typically have twelve month revenue recognition periods which match the subscription periods 
for the fiscal year ended february   we sold approximately  subscriptions to our rhel products compared to  in the previous year 
this increase resulted from the increasing level of adoption of red hat enterprise linux as as a primary operating system by larger enterprise customers and the introduction of two additional red hat enterprise linux offerings in march  red hat enterprise linux es and red hat enterprise linux ws 
these two additional products are targeted at the lower end of the server market and the technical developer workstation market and have less features and more limited service level agreements 
we believe that our ability to continue to increase adoption rates of all three of our red hat enterprise linux products and maintain competitive pricing are critical to our success 
we derive our revenues and generate cash from customers from two sources i subscription revenue  which includes retail  enterprise subscriptions  and embedded subscription revenue  and ii services revenue which includes enterprise services and embedded services described under critical accounting policies below 
for fiscal and  our total revenues were million and million  respectively 
the arrangements with our customers that create enterprise subscription revenues are explained in detail under critical accounting policies below and in note summary of significant accounting policies 
these agreements typically involve the sale of subscriptions to red hat enterprise linux and in certain cases will include the sales of subscriptions to other red hat subscription offerings or red hat services 
our revenues are also affected by corporate  government and consumer spending levels 
in evaluating the performance of our business  we consider a number of factors 
these factors include total revenues  operating income and cash flows on a geographic basis 
in addition  we also consider the following factors in our evaluation process subscription volumes 
our rhel products  as  es and ws  are sold under subscription agreements 
these agreements typically have a one year subscription period 
the base subscription entitles the end user to one year of maintenance  which entitles the end user to configuration support and updates and upgrades to the technology  when and if available  during the term of the subscription 
our customers have the ability to purchase higher levels of subscriptions that increase the level of support the customer is entitled to receive 
subscription volumes increased each quarter during fiscal and are being driven primarily by the market acceptance of using the linux operating system in enterprise data centers and our expansion of sales channels during the year 
sales by geography 
we operate our business in three geographic regions  north america us and canada  emea europe  middle east and africa  and asia pacific japan  australia  korea and china 
in fiscal  million or of our revenue was generated outside north america compared to million or in fiscal the percentage of our revenues generated from our international operations is expected to increase as our international sales force and channels become more mature and as we enter new locations or expand our presence in existing locations 
the increase in our international revenues reflects the increasing adoption of the linux operating system in both europe and japan 
as noted in the segment reporting section of note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  our revenue in both emea and asia pacific increased at higher percentages than in north america 
in the past months  we have entered new markets such as china  belgium  netherlands  and eastern europe and we expect our expansion to continue to be greater in these markets 
deferred revenue balances 
our deferred revenue balance at february  was million 
because of our subscription model and revenue recognition policies  deferred revenues improve predictability of future revenues 
deferred revenues at february   have increased by more than as compared to february  cash  cash equivalents and investments in debt securities 
cash  cash equivalents and investments in debt securities balances at february  totaled million 
during fiscal  we generated million in cash flow from operations primarily related to the increase in sales of subscriptions to red hat enterprise linux during the fiscal year 
we also had positive cash flow provided by financing activities during the fiscal year of million 
this primarily relates to the issuance of senior convertible debt in january which resulted in net proceeds of million to us 
our significant cash balance gives us the ability to take advantage of acquisition opportunities and increase investment in international opportunities 
in fiscal  we are focused  on among other things  i continuing to build on the global market momentum behind the adoption of linux as an operating system by enterprise customers  ii continue our market penetration through channel partners  iii drive high renewal rates of subscriptions sold in prior periods and iv increase the contribution to our subscription sales by intel hardware vendors 
critical accounting policies our critical accounting policies include the following revenue recognition  and impairment of long lived assets revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition sop  as amended by sop and sop  emerging issues task force no 
eitf and staff accounting bulletin no 
sab depending upon the nature of the arrangement 
revenue recognition in accordance with these pronouncements can be complex due to the nature and variability of our sales transactions 
subscription revenue subscription revenue is comprised of enterprise and embedded revenues 
enterprise subscription revenue is comprised primarily of revenue from sales of red hat enterprise linux software solutions  however we also generate enterprise subscription revenue from sales of red hat linux  software development tools  technical support and maintenance fees 
during fiscal  we released the first versions of our red hat enterprise linux offerings  red hat enterprise linux as  es and ws 
these technologies are sold under a subscription agreement with specified renewal rates 
our red hat enterprise linux rhel products have one and three year base subscription periods 
the base subscription entitles the end user to the technology itself and post customer support services pcs consisting of  security errata  updates to the technology  upgrades to new versions of rhel on a when and if available basis during the term of the subscription  and various levels of red hat support 
we recognize the revenue from the sale of our red hat enterprise linux offerings ratably over the period of the subscription 
we do not sell the rhel technology or the components of the pcs that are included in the subscription on a stand alone basis 
we sell red hat enterprise linux through four channels distribution  direct sales  original equipment manufacturers oems and the web 
in the majority of our transactions  subscriptions to red hat enterprise linux are sold on a stand alone basis 
our standard subscription term is one year 
the revenue associated with the sale of subscription to red hat enterprise linux is recognized ratably over the period of the end users subscription 
our subscription agreements with our large enterprise customers sometimes include multiple subscription and or service elements 
these arrangements typically include a subscription to red hat enterprise linux  red hat network  training services and or professional consulting 
for these contracts  we separate the various elements and recognize revenue attributable to each element in the manner that best matches the delivery of value to our customer 
red hat enterprise linux and red hat network subscription revenues are recognized ratably over the subscription term  training services revenue is recognized when students attend class  and professional services revenue is recognized on a time and materials basis as the services are delivered 
when possible  we allocate revenue to each component of the contract based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of its fair value 
vsoe for our red hat enterprise linux subscription agreements is created by the fact that we regularly sell rhel subscriptions on a stand alone basis with renewal rates for year two equal to the amount paid in year one or there is a stated renewal rate in the contract 
in contracts where vsoe exists for training or consulting services  such vsoe is demonstrated by either  the ability to purchase additional training or consulting services at specified rates and on a stand alone basis upon expiration of the original term of the multiple element arrangement or regularly selling the training or consulting services on a stand alone basis at substantially the same rates as those charged in the multiple element arrangement 
in certain multiple element arrangements where vsoe cannot be established  the entire value of the contract is recognized ratably over the term of the agreement 
our training and consulting services are not essential to the functionality of red hat enterprise linux 
the majority of our customers purchase subscriptions to red hat enterprise linux without purchasing any training or consulting services 
in addition  our enterprise subscription revenue is partially derived from sales of our red hat network service offerings 
red hat network is an internet based set of services to assure the security  availability and reliability of all of our red hat software solutions 
red hat network is sold in the form of an annual subscription and revenues related to these are recognized ratably over the term of the subscription 
embedded subscription revenue consists of revenue for technical support and maintenance services provided pursuant to software compiling  debugging and optimization agreements 
revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the agreement  which is typically months 
services revenue services revenue is comprised of embedded development and enterprise services 
enterprise services are comprised of revenue for consulting services  engineering services  and customer training and education 
consulting services are provided under agreements where customers are paying us on an hourly basis to assist in the deployment of our open source technologies 
revenue from customer training and education is recognized at the date the services are performed 
embedded development services are contracts for compiling  debugging and optimization of various open source software technologies 
revenue is recognized on the percentage of completion method  provided that we have the ability to make reliable estimates of progress towards completion  the fee for such services is fixed and determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate the recoverability of our property and equipment and other assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
sfas requires that one accounting model be used for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  whether previously held and used or newly acquired  and by broadening the presentation of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions 
an impairment loss is recognized when the net book value of such assets exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets or the business to which the assets relate 
impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the assets

subscription revenue increased to million for the year ended february  from million for the year ended february  enterprise technologies subscription enterprise technologies subscription revenue primarily relates to both direct and indirect sales of red hat enterprise linux and other related software subscriptions such as red hat clustering suite and systems management services provided by red hat network 
enterprise technologies subscription revenue increased to million for the year ended february  from million for the year ended february  for the fiscal year ended february   we sold approximately  subscriptions to our red hat enterprise linux offerings compared to  subscriptions in the previous fiscal year 
the average number of units that were deployed during the year ended february  approximated  compared to approximately  in the same period in the prior year 
our rhel products  as  es and ws  are sold under subscription agreements 
these arrangements typically have a one year subscription period 
the base subscription generally entitles the end user to one year of maintenance  which entitles the end user to configuration support  and updates and upgrades to the technology  when and if available  during the term of the subscription 
subscription volumes increased each quarter during fiscal the increase in sales volume is being driven by the market acceptance of using the linux operating system in mission critical areas of computing by the large enterprise  as well as our expansion of sales channels during the year 
retail technologies retail revenue  which consists of sales of red hat linux and professional workstation to consumers through either value added resellers or distributors  decreased to million for the year ending february  from million for the year ended february  this decrease is due to our focus on the sale of subscriptions to our enterprise technologies to large enterprises rather than on the consumer market 
this market is no longer a strategic source of revenue for us  therefore we expect our retail revenues to continue to decline in fiscal as we will not aggressively promote new products through this channel 
we expect that our retail revenues will be less than million in fiscal unless we later decide to put new products into the retail channel 
we do not believe that retail revenues are currently a significant component of our revenues 
embedded subscription embedded subscription revenue decreased to million for the year ended february  from million for the year ended february  the decrease in embedded subscription revenue is related to the expiration of support arrangements for semiconductor and telecommunication customers due to the weak performance of these industries in previous years that affected research and development spending 
we are beginning to see additional interest in the use of red hat enterprise linux as an operating system for large devices such as network routing equipment and we believe there may be an opportunity to increase our participation in the embedded market 
services revenue enterprise technologies services enterprise technologies services revenues include fees received from enterprise customers for deployment of red hat enterprise technologies  customer training and education fees and fees received for adding certain functionality to red hat enterprise linux for our major hardware oem partners 
enterprise technology services revenue decreased to million in the year ended february  from million in the year ended february  the decrease in enterprise technologies services revenue is primarily due to a decrease in the revenues earned from agreements with our oem partners of approximately million and a million decrease in consulting services related to services performed for large enterprise customers for the deployment of red hat enterprise linux 
these decreases were primarily offset by customer training and education services revenue which increased to million in year ended february  from million in the year ended february  the increase is the direct result of the continued migration of larger enterprises to our red hat enterprise linux platform from a proprietary unix platform  increasing the need to train system administrators and developers 
embedded services embedded services revenue increased to million for the year ended february  from million for the year ended february  the increase in embedded markets is due to the improvement in the semiconductor and telecommunications industries which has positively impacted research and development spending 
we have maintained a small core team that maintains a strategic presence in this marketplace 
cost of revenue cost of subscription revenue the cost of enterprise technologies and retail subscription revenue primarily consists of expenses we incur to manufacture  package  distribute and support our solutions 
these costs include expenses for physical media  literature and packaging  fulfillment and shipping  labor related costs to provide technical support and maintenance of which the largest component is labor cost 
cost of subscription revenue increased to million in the year ended february  from million in the year ended february  this increase was entirely related to an increase in the cost of providing technical support and maintenance of our enterprise products which is primarily email or telephone support to end users 
the increase in support costs was due to the increased number of subscriptions to red hat enterprise linux that we sold during fiscal  approximately  compared to  in the prior fiscal year 
as the number of subscriptions for red hat enterprise linux continues to increase  our cost of subscription revenues will also increase 
cost of services revenue cost of services revenue is primarily comprised of salaries and related costs including non cash  stock based compensation charges incurred for our personnel to deliver custom development  open source consulting engineering  training and education  and hardware certification services 
cost of services revenue increased to million in the year ended february  from million in the year ended february  the increase is directly related to the increase in our enterprise technologies services revenue 
the cost of our customer training and education services increased million which is consistent with the increase in revenue 
this increase was partially offset by a million decrease in our professional consulting costs related to headcount reductions to our consulting staff during fiscal as we have revised our consulting strategy to focus on strategic consulting and entered into agreements to provide people intensive development consulting 
gross profit gross profit increased to million in the year ended february  from million in the year ended february  this increase was entirely due to the increase in revenue and profitability related to our high gross margin red hat enterprise linux offerings 
the growth and profitability of our enterprise business was offset by a slight decline in the embedded segment which had gross profit of million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal operating expenses sales and marketing sales and marketing expense consists primarily of salaries and other related costs including non cash  stock based compensation charges for sales and marketing personnel  sales commissions  travel  public relations and marketing materials and tradeshows 
sales and marketing expense increased to million in the year ended february  from million in the year ended february  this increase was primarily due to a million increase in north america and million increase related to our international operations 
we have increased our sales force in all geographies in the past twelve months 
these increases were partially offset by lower spending on marketing 
research and development research and development expense consists primarily of personnel and related costs including non cash  stock based compensation charges for development of software technologies and systems management offerings 
research and development expense increased to million in the year ended february  from million in the year ended february  the increase in research and development expense resulted from increased spending related to adding enterprise engineers to support the development and integration of our red hat enterprise linux operating systems and red hat network and costs of research and development personnel from the acquisition of sistina  inc in late december general and administrative general and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel and related costs including non cash  stock based compensation charges for general corporate functions  including finance  accounting  legal  human resources  facilities and information systems expenses 
general and administrative expense increased to million in the year ended february  from million in the year ended february  this increase relates primarily to increased administrative costs of approximately  as a result of international expansion activities and increased legal costs related to our various legal proceedings of approximately  we expect our general and administrative expenses across all functional areas  including legal  finance and human capital  to continue to increase in future periods as our business continues to expand 
amortization of intangibles amortization of goodwill and intangibles expense decreased to million in the year ended february  from million in the year ended february  costs incurred for acquiring trademarks  copyrights and patents are capitalized as intangibles and amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives  which range from three to five years 
the decrease in amortization of intangibles expense was due to previously capitalized costs being fully amortized in fiscal years ended february  and february  total revenue total revenue increased to million for the year ended february  from million in the year ended february  the increase was driven by significant growth in our enterprise subscription and services revenues of our business partially offset by a decline in the embedded segment of our business 
subscription revenue subscription revenue increased to million for the year ended february  from million for the year ended february  enterprise technologies subscription enterprise technologies revenue increased to million for the year ended february  from million for the year ended february  for the fiscal year ended february   we sold approximately  subscriptions to our red hat enterprise linux as operating system 
this significantly exceeded management s expectations of the number of subscriptions to be sold in the initial year of the release of our red hat enterprise linux technologies 
in addition  red hat network  our systems management services offering  increased revenue by million for the year ended february  our enterprise offerings are sold with annual renewable subscriptions and all have month revenue recognition periods to match the subscription period 
therefore  we will continue to recognize revenue on these subscriptions through fiscal and expect to increase the number of subscriptions sold to red hat enterprise technologies sequentially quarter over quarter during the next months 
we are focused on building the first layer of renewable enterprise subscriptions which will begin to renew in the third quarter of our fiscal retail technologies retail technologies revenue decreased to million for the year ended february  from million for the year ended february  this decrease is due to our focus during fiscal on the sale of subscriptions to our enterprise technologies to large enterprise customers rather than on the consumer market 
retail technologies revenue has been separately stated on the accompanying consolidated statement of operations as this market is no longer a strategic source of revenue for us but instead represents a channel for providing leading edge technology to sophisticated users 
we are focused on the sale of subscriptions to our enterprise technologies to large enterprises rather than the consumer market 
embedded subscription embedded subscription revenue decreased to million for the year ended february  from million for the year ended february  the decrease in embedded markets is primarily due to the weak performance of the semiconductor and telecommunications industries that has affected research and development spending during this period 
services revenue enterprise technologies service enterprise technologies services revenue increased to million in the year ended february  from million in the year ended february  the increase in enterprise technology services revenue is primarily due to an increase in the revenue earned from our relationships with oem vendors of approximately million and a million increase in consulting services related to services performed for large enterprise customers for the deployment of red hat enterprise linux 
customer training and education services revenue also increased to million in year ended february  from million in the year ended february  the increase in all components of our services revenues is the direct result of the continued migration of larger enterprises to our red hat enterprise linux platform from a proprietary unix operating system and the momentum behind the acceptance of red hat enterprise linux as a mission critical operating system for the large enterprise 
embedded embedded services revenue decreased to million for the year ended february  from million for the year ended february  the decrease in embedded services revenues is due to the continued weak performance of the semiconductor and telecommunications industries that has negatively affected research and development spending and due to our reduction in focus and decrease in the number of personnel dedicated to this business to a small core team that maintains a strategic presence in this marketplace 
cost of revenue cost of subscription revenue cost of subscription revenue decreased to million in the year ended february  from million in the year ended february  this decrease was related to a million reduction in expenses incurred for physical media  literature  packaging and fulfillment related to our retail product  which is consistent with the decline in retail revenues  partially offset by an increase in the cost of providing technical support and maintenance for our enterprise products 
cost of services revenue cost of services revenue increased million or to million in the year ended february  from million in the year ended february  the increase is directly related to the increase in our enterprise technologies services revenue 
the cost of our customer training and education services increased million and our enterprise consulting services increased by million related to headcount additions to our consulting staff 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease of million in embedded development services costs as a result of the restructuring of this segment which was completed in february gross profit gross profit increased to million in the year ended february  from million in the year ended february  this increase was entirely due to the increase in revenue and profitability related to our red hat enterprise linux offerings which were introduced during the fiscal year ended february  and carry significantly higher gross margins than our retail and embedded product offerings 
the strength in growth and profitability of our enterprise business was offset by the significant decline in the embedded segment which had gross profit of million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal operating expenses sales and marketing sales and marketing expense decreased to million in the year ended february  from million in the year ended february  this decrease was primarily due to a reduction in our spend on marketing activities of million partially offset by an increase in enterprise sales costs as we increased the size of our direct outside sales force 
research and development research and development expense increased to million in the year ended february  from million in the year ended february  the increase in research and development expense resulted from increased spending of million related to the addition of approximately enterprise engineers during late fiscal and throughout fiscal to support the development and integration of our red hat enterprise linux operating system and red hat network  and was partially offset by a decrease of million in non cash stock based compensation expenses as certain deferred compensation balances were fully amortized during fiscal general and administrative general and administrative expense decreased to million in the year ended february  from million in the year ended february  this decrease resulted from a significant decrease in the number of companies acquired during fiscal resulting in  a decrease in merger and acquisition expenses to  for the year ended february  from million for the year ended february  and a decrease in stock based compensation expense of million  and was partially offset by increased health and directors and officers insurance costs and bad debt expenses 
amortization of goodwill and intangibles amortization of goodwill and intangibles expense decreased to million in the year ended february  from million in the year ended february  the decrease in amortization of goodwill and intangibles is primarily due to the fact that for the year ended february   no amortization of goodwill was recorded as prescribed by new accounting principles 
costs incurred for acquiring trademarks  copyrights and patents as well as capitalized software are capitalized as intangibles and amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives  which range from three to five years 
amortization of intangibles expense was not materially different from year to year 
restructuring charges restructuring charges for the year ended february   which totaled million  consist of an impairment of million in the carrying value of goodwill and intangibles related to acquisitions made in prior periods  various facility closings  and million in severance and related expenses 
these restructuring charges were primarily due to a sharpening of our focus on providing an enterprise class operating system  red hat enterprise linux  to significant enterprises 
as a result  we terminated certain employees of planning technologies  inc  pti and all employees of hell s kitchen systems  inc  hks and akopia  inc 
akopia during fiscal as these technologies were aimed at the small and medium business market 
in total  we terminated employees 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we completed the re allocation of our resources to focus on the global market which resulted in discontinuing our network consulting business 
the additional restructuring charge in fiscal of million related to some additional severance for employees affected by the restructuring who were not notified of their termination until after february  other income expense  net interest income expense  net  decreased to million in the year ended february  from million in the year ended february  these amounts are net of interest expense of  in the year ended february  and  in the year ended february  the decrease in interest income expense  net  from an average return on our investments of in fiscal to a return of in fiscal  resulted from reinvestment of proceeds from the sales and maturities of fixed income investments in a declining interest rate environment that existed throughout fiscal in addition  we incurred foreign currency losses of  in our fourth quarter of fiscal as a result of the weakening us dollar against the euro and the japanese yen which reduced our other income in fiscal discontinued operations during january  we adopted a formal plan to discontinue our network consulting operations because these operations were not strategic to our decision to focus on developing an enterprise class operating system for large enterprise customers 
accordingly  the network consulting operations were accounted for as a discontinued operation beginning with the fiscal year consolidated financial statements 
we completed the disposal of the network consulting operations in february through termination of associated employees 
the terminations resulted in approximately million in annual payroll and payroll related cost to us in future periods 
loss on disposal of discontinued operations of million in fiscal year included the write off of goodwill recorded in pti s acquisition of enterprise network systems  inc  ens of million  severance and related costs of million  and a provision against accounts receivable of million 
acquisitions sistina software  inc in december  we completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding common stock of sistina software  inc sistina in exchange for the issuance of  shares of our common stock and the assumption of all of the outstanding sistina stock options valued  in the aggregate  at million 
the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired in the transaction were million and million  respectively 
we engaged an independent valuation expert to determine the fair market value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
the excess of purchase price over the fair values of the net assets acquired of million has been recorded as goodwill 
in addition  the transaction includes million of contingent consideration based on an earn out structured in three tranches 
the earn out is based on the achievement of certain bookings targets for the technologies and services previously sold by sistina over the period beginning on december  and ending march  the number of shares issued under the earn out will be determined based on the average closing price of our common stock during the trading days prior to issuance of each tranche of such earn out shares 
no contingent consideration was earned during the initial earn out period  which ended on march  one of the keys to our business strategy is to receive increasing annual subscription revenues on a per server basis by providing additional value to our customers in the form of layers of technology that will be provided on top of our red hat enterprise linux operating system and through providing additional systems management services 
sistina provides us with a global file system solution which is our initial entry into the storage management marketplace 
we completed this acquisition in december and it is too early to assess the results of this acquisition 
liquidity and capital resources we have historically derived a significant portion of our liquidity and operating capital from the sale of equity securities  including private sales of preferred stock and the sale of common stock in our initial and secondary public offerings  and from cash flows from operations 
at february   we had total cash and investments of million  which is comprised of million in cash and cash equivalents  million of short term  fixed income investments and million of long term  fixed income investments 
at february  we had total cash and investments of approximately million 
this significant increase in cash and investments during fiscal year is due to million in net proceeds raised from the issuance of convertible debentures in january and over million in cash generated from our operations during fiscal at february   cash and cash equivalents totaled million  an increase of million as compared to february  the increase in cash and cash equivalents during fiscal resulted primarily from the issuance of the convertible debentures in january  net of issuance of costs  of million  cash provided by operations of million  a total of million in cash received from the exercise of common stock options and sale of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan  net cash acquired in the acquisition of sistina of million  and million in employee income taxes withheld from the exercise of common stock options in february which were disbursed in march these sources of cash were offset by the purchase of investments in debt securities  net of sales of debt securities  of million  purchases of property and equipment of million  primarily related to the re implemenation of our oracle instance  million of cash  net  used to pay down our line of credit and million of cash used to pay down capital lease obligations 
cash provided by operations of million in the year ended february   represented the net income of million  an increase in deferred revenue of million  an increase in accounts payable of million  an increase in accrued expenses of million and net non cash charges of million 
these sources of cash were partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of million and an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets  including inventory  of million 
the increase in accounts receivable and deferred revenue primarily resulted from an increase in the number of subscriptions sold to red hat enterprise linux to  subscriptions in the fourth quarter of fiscal as compared to the sale of  subscriptions to red hat enterprise linux in the fourth quarter of fiscal in the fiscal year ended february   cash used in operations was  the significant improvement in our cash flow from operations in fiscal is a result of increased sales of annual subscriptions to red hat enterprise linux  which resulted in the million increase in deferred revenues  as well as management s continued focus on improved operating profits and preserving our cash balance 
we do not believe that there are any collectibility or billing problems with our customers that have not been appropriately reserved at each balance sheet date 
cash used in investing activities of million was comprised of the purchase of investments in debt securities  net of maturities  of million  purchases of property and equipment mainly computer software  hardware and computer networking equipment totaling million  offset by million  net  of cash acquired in the acquisition of sistina in late december the significant majority of the purchases of investments occurred as a result of the investment of a portion of the approximately million in net proceeds received from the completion of the convertible debt offering in january cash provided by financing activities of million for the year ended february  was comprised of million in net proceeds from the issuance of convertible senior debentures in january  million in employee income taxes withheld from the exercise of common stock options in february which were remitted to taxing authorities in march and million  combined  in proceeds received from the exercise of common stock options by employees and the sale of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
these sources of cash were partially offset by million of repayments  net of borrowings  made against our line of credit and million in payments under capital lease obligations 
in january  we issued million in convertible senior debentures 
the debentures mature on january  and bear interest at a rate of per annum  payable semiannually on january and july of each year 
the debentures are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of our other existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated debt 
the debentures are convertible into shares of our common stock under certain circumstances prior to maturity at a conversion rate of shares per  principal amount of debentures which represents a conversion price of approximately per share subject to adjustment under certain conditions 
we may redeem the debentures  in whole or in part  in cash at any time on or after january  holders of the debentures may require us to redeem the debentures  in whole or in part  in cash on january of  and as of february   no debentures were redeemed 
accrued interest to the redemption date will be paid by us in any such redemption 
no interest payments were made during the year ended february  accrued interest at february  was million 
at february   cash and cash equivalents totaled million  a decrease of million as compared to february  the decrease in cash and cash equivalents during fiscal resulted primarily from the following sources the purchase of investments in debt securities  net of sales of debt securities  of million  cash used by operations of  purchases of property and equipment of million  cash used in the acquisition of a business of million  and  used to fund stock repurchases 
these uses of cash were offset by million of cash raised from borrowings  net of repayments  and million in cash received from the exercise of common stock options and sale of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
cash used in operations of  in the year ended february   represented the net loss of million  an increase in accounts receivable of million  an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of million  a decrease in accounts payable of million and a decrease in accrued expenses of million 
these uses of cash were partially offset by an increase in deferred revenue of million  an increase in deferred lease credits of million and net non cash charges of million 
cash used in operations during fiscal includes million for payments of restructuring costs which contributed to the million reduction in accrued expenses 
in the fiscal year ended february   cash used in operations was million 
the significant improvement in our cash flow used in operations in fiscal is a result of management s increased focus on improved operating results and preserving our cash balance  as well as a result of sales of annual subscriptions to red hat enterprise linux  which resulted in the million increase in our deferred revenues and the increase in our accounts receivable of million 
cash used in investing activities of million was comprised of the purchase of investments in debt securities  net of maturities  of million  purchases of property and equipment mainly computer software  hardware and computer networking equipment totaling million  and million in cash used to acquire a business 
as market interest rates declined throughout the fiscal year ended february   we used cash and cash equivalents to purchase fixed income debt securities to improve the yield on our investments 
the million used to acquire a business relates to cash paid in october as part of the acquisition cost of nocpulse  inc cash provided by financing activities of million for the year ended february  was comprised of million in net proceeds from borrowings from our line of credit and million in proceeds received from the sale of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan and from the exercise of common stock options 
this was partially offset by  used to purchase  shares of treasury stock during fiscal  and million in payments under capital lease obligations 
we have experienced a substantial increase in our operating expenses since our inception in connection with the growth of our operations  the development of our red hat enterprise linux technologies  the expansion of our services operations and our acquisition activity 
our capital requirements during the year ending february  will depend on numerous factors including the amount of resources we devote to funding the development of our red hat enterprise linux products  such as red hat enterprise linux as  es and ws  accelerating the development of our systems management services  improving and extending our services and the technologies used to deliver these services to our customers  pursuing strategic acquisitions and alliances  and making possible investments in businesses  products and technologies 
we have made substantial progress in improving cash flow from operations 
in fiscal  and  we used 
million  million and million  respectively  to fund our operations 
in fiscal  we generated million in cash from our operations  more so than in any other fiscal period of our operating history 
our cash flow provided by operations for fiscal  exceeded the expectations we had at the beginning of the fiscal year and is due to both the greatly increased demand for our products and services  which also affords us leverage in negotiating up front payments for annual subscriptions from customers  and the increase in the number of subscriptions sold for red hat enterprise linux in fiscal as compared to fiscal given the significant improvement we have made from using cash to fund our operations and the million of cash and investments held at february   we do not anticipate the need to raise cash to fund our operations either through the sale of additional equity or through the issuance of debt for the foreseeable future 
however  we may take advantage of favorable capital market situations that may arise from time to time to raise additional capital 
we believe that cash flow from operations will continue to improve  however  there can be no assurances that we will improve our cash flow from operations from the current rate or that such cash flows will be adequate to fund other investments or acquisitions that we may choose to make 
we may choose to accelerate the expansion of our business from our current plans  which may require us to raise additional funds through the sale of equity or debt securities or through other financing means 
there can be no assurances that any such financing would occur in amounts or on terms favorable to us  if at all 
we have no off balance sheet financing arrangements and do not utilize any structured debt  special purpose or similar unconsolidated entities for liquidity or financing purposes 
as of february   our principal commitments consisted of obligations outstanding under capital and operating leases 
the following table summarizes our principal contractual obligations at february  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in thousands total less than year years years more than years capital lease obligations operating lease obligations senior convertible debentures total recent accounting pronouncements see discussion in note to the consolidated financial statements 
risk factors risks related to our business we may not be able to timely release major product releases and upgrades to our products because we depend on the support of linux developers not employed by us for improvements and advancement of our red hat enterprise linux technologies 
we may not be able to release major product releases and upgrades of red hat enterprise linux on a timely basis because the heart of red hat enterprise linux  the linux kernel  is maintained by third parties 
linus torvalds  the original developer of the linux kernel  and a small group of engineers  many of whom are not employed by us  are primarily responsible for the development and evolution of the linux kernel 
if this group of developers fails to further develop the linux kernel or if mr 
torvalds or prominent linux developers who are members of this group and are currently employed by us were to join one of our competitors  no longer be employed by us or no longer work on the linux kernel  we would have to either rely on another party to further develop the kernel or develop it ourselves 
we cannot predict whether enhancements to the kernel would be available from reliable alternative sources 
we could be forced to rely to a greater extent on our own development efforts  which would increase our development expenses and may delay our product release and upgrade schedules 
in addition  any failure on the part of the kernel developers to further develop and enhance the kernel could stifle the development of additional linux based applications 
if we fail to continue to establish and maintain strategic distribution and other collaborative relationships with industry leading companies  we may not be able to attract and retain a larger customer base 
our success depends in part on our ability to continue to establish and maintain strategic distribution and other collaborative relationships with industry leading hardware manufacturers such as hewlett packard  dell  ibm  fujitsu and others  distributors  software vendors such as oracle and enterprise solutions providers 
these relationships allow us to offer our products and services to a much larger customer base than we would otherwise be able to through our direct sales and marketing efforts 
we may not be able to maintain these relationships or replace them on attractive terms 
in addition  our existing strategic relationships do not  and any future strategic relationships may not  afford us any exclusive marketing or distribution rights 
as a result  many of the companies with which we have strategic alliances pursue alternative technologies and develop alternative products and services in addition to or in lieu of our products and services  either on their own or in collaboration with others  including our competitors 
moreover  we cannot guarantee that the companies with which we have strategic relationships will market our products effectively or continue to devote the resources necessary to provide us with effective sales  marketing  and technical support 
if third party enterprise software application providers do not continue to make their new applications compatible with our linux based operating systems  our software will cease to be competitive 
our products will not be competitive unless new enterprise software applications continue to be compatible with our linux based operating systems 
we intend to encourage the development of additional applications that operate on linux based operating systems by attracting third party developers to the linux platform  providing open source tools to create these applications and maintaining our existing developer relationships through marketing and technical support for third party developers 
if we are not successful in achieving these goals  however  our products will not be competitive and our sales growth will be adversely affected 
we may be unable to predict the future course of open source technology development  which could reduce the market appeal of our products and damage our reputation 
we do not exercise control over many aspects of the development of open source technology 
different groups of open source software programmers compete with one another to develop new technology 
typically  the technology developed by one group will become more widely used than that developed by others 
if we adopt new technology and incorporate it into our products and competing technology becomes more widely used or accepted  the market appeal of our products may be reduced and that could harm our reputation  diminish the red hat brand and result in decreased revenue 
because of characteristics of open source software  there are few technology barriers to entry in the open source market by new competitors  which could make it easier for companies with greater resources than us to compete with us 
one of the characteristics of open source software is that anyone can modify the existing software or develop new software that competes with existing open source software 
such competition can develop without the degree of overhead and lead time required by traditional proprietary software companies 
it is possible for a competitor with greater resources than ours to develop its own open source operating system solution  potentially reducing the demand for our solutions 
we have entered into and may continue to enter into or seek to enter into business combinations and acquisitions  which may be difficult to integrate  disrupt our business  dilute stockholder value or divert management attention 
we have acquired several businesses  including  most recently  sistina software  inc on december  as part of our business strategy  we may enter into additional business combinations and acquisitions in the future 
we have limited experience in making acquisitions 
in addition  acquisitions are typically accompanied by a number of risks  including the difficulty of integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired companies  the maintenance of acceptable standards  controls  procedures and policies  the potential disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management  the impairment of relationships with employees and customers as a result of any integration of new management and other personnel  the inability to maintain a relationship with customers of the acquired business  the difficulty of incorporating acquired technology and rights into our products and services  the potential failure to achieve the expected benefits of the combination or acquisition  expenses related to the acquisition  potential unknown liabilities associated with acquired businesses  and unanticipated expenses related to acquired technology and its integration into existing technology 
if we are not successful in completing acquisitions that we may pursue in the future  we would be required to reevaluate our growth strategy and we may have incurred substantial expenses and devoted significant management time and resources in seeking to complete the acquisitions 
in addition  with future acquisitions  we could use substantial portions of our available cash as all or a portion of the purchase price 
we could also issue additional securities as consideration for these acquisitions  which could cause our stockholders to suffer significant dilution  or incur substantial debt 
any future acquisitions may not generate additional revenue for us 
if we fail to effectively manage our growth  our operations and financial results could be adversely affected 
we have expanded our operations rapidly in recent years 
for example  our aggregate revenues increased from approximately million for the year ended february  to approximately million for the year ended february  as of march   we had employees  up from as of march  in addition  we continue to explore ways to extend our product and service offerings  and geographic reach 
our growth has placed and may continue to place a strain on our management systems  information systems  resources and internal controls 
our ability to successfully offer products and services and implement our business plan requires adequate information systems and resources and oversight from our senior management 
we have  with our audit committee  undertaken to review and improve our financial and managerial controls  reporting systems and procedures 
we will need to continue to modify and improve these controls  systems and procedures and other internal controls and compliance procedures as we continue to grow and expand our business 
as we grow  we must also continue to hire  train  supervise and manage new employees 
we may not be able to hire  train  supervise and manage sufficient personnel or develop management and operating systems to manage our expansion effectively 
if we are unable to manage our growth and improve our controls  systems and procedures  our operations and financial results could be adversely affected 
risks related to legal uncertainty we could be prevented from selling or developing our software if the gnu general public license and similar licenses under which our products are developed and licensed are not enforceable 
the linux kernel and the red hat linux operating system have been developed and licensed under the gnu general public license and similar open source licenses 
these licenses state that any program licensed under them may be liberally copied  modified and distributed 
the gnu general public license is a subject of litigation in the case of the sco group  inc v 
international business machines corp  pending in the united states district court for the district of utah 
it is possible that a court would hold these licenses to be unenforceable in that litigation or that someone could assert a claim for proprietary rights in a program developed and distributed under them 
any ruling by a court that these licenses are not enforceable  or that linux based operating systems  or significant portions of them  may not be liberally copied  modified or distributed  would have the effect of preventing us from selling or developing our products 
our subscription based contract model may encounter customer resistance 
the subscription agreement for red hat enterprise linux requires customers to agree to a subscription for our systems management services for each machine on which they deploy red hat enterprise linux 
at the same time  the subscription agreement places no restriction on the customer s right to redistribute red hat enterprise linux 
while we believe this practice fully complies with the requirements of the gnu general public license  and while we have reviewed this practice with the free software foundation  the organization that maintains and provides interpretations of the gnu general public license  we may still encounter customer resistance to this distribution model 
to the extent we are unsuccessful in promoting or defending this distribution model  our business and operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
if our products are found to infringe third party intellectual property rights  we could be required to redesign our products  replace components of our products or enter into license agreements with third parties 
we have committed to all of our customers with valid  registered red hat enterprise subscriptions that if any portion of our red hat enterprise linux product is found to infringe any third party intellectual property rights we will  at our expense and option i obtain the right for the customer to continue to use the product consistent with their subscription agreement with us  ii modify the product so that it is non infringing  or iii replace the infringing component with a non infringing component 
although we cannot predict whether we will need to satisfy this commitment  and although our subscription agreements typically state that our liability thereunder shall not exceed the amount a customer paid to us during the previous months  satisfying the commitment could be costly and time consuming and could materially and adversely affect our financial results 
in addition  our insurance policies may not adequately cover our exposure to this type of claim 
we are vulnerable to claims that our products infringe third party intellectual property rights because our products are comprised of distinct software components  many of which are developed by numerous independent parties  and an adverse legal decision affecting our intellectual property could materially harm our business 
we are vulnerable to claims that our products infringe third party intellectual property rights because our products are comprised of distinct software components  many of which are developed by numerous independent parties 
claims for infringement of intellectual property rights may be filed and may seek damages and injunctive relief 
in particular  third parties may assert claims for infringement or claims based on trade secret theories 
the risk of infringement claims is exacerbated by the fact that much of the code in our products is developed by numerous independent parties over whom we exercise no supervision or control 
it is further exacerbated by our lack of access to unpublished software patent applications 
claims of infringement could require us to seek to obtain licenses from third parties in order to continue offering our products  reengineer our products  or discontinue the sale of our products in the event reengineering could not be accomplished on a timely basis 
sco group  inc  or sco  has publicly alleged that certain linux kernels contain unauthorized unix code or derivative works 
on august   we filed a complaint against sco in the united states district court for the district of delaware seeking  among other things  a declaratory judgment that we are not infringing any of sco s intellectual property rights 
sco  to date  has not asserted a claim of infringement against us 
uncertainty concerning sco s allegations  regardless of their merit  could adversely affect sales of our products 
if sco were to prevail in this or other actions related to their claims regarding linux  our business could be materially and adversely affected 
defending patent infringement  copyright infringement and or trade secret claims  even claims without significant merit  can be expensive 
an adverse legal decision affecting our intellectual property could materially harm our business 
defending patent infringement  copyright infringement and or trade secret claims  even claims without significant merit  can be expensive 
an adverse legal decision affecting our intellectual property could materially harm our business 
our products may contain defects that may be costly to correct  delay market acceptance of our products and expose us to litigation 
despite testing by ourselves and our customers  errors have been and may continue to be found in our products after commencement of commercial shipments 
this risk is exacerbated by the fact that much of the code in our products is developed by independent parties over whom we exercise no supervision or control 
if errors are discovered  we may have to make significant expenditures of capital to eliminate them and may not be able to successfully correct them in a timely manner or at all 
errors and failures in our products could result in a loss of  or delay in  market acceptance of our products and could damage our reputation and our ability to convince commercial users of the benefits of linux based operating systems and other open source software products 
in addition  failures in our products could cause system failures for our customers who may assert warranty and other claims for substantial damages against us 
although our license agreements with our customers typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential product liability claims  it is possible that these provisions may not be effective or enforceable under the laws of some jurisdictions 
in addition  our insurance policies may not adequately limit our exposure to this type of claim 
these claims  even if unsuccessful  could be costly and time consuming to defend 
our efforts to protect our trademarks may not be adequate to prevent third parties from misappropriating our intellectual property rights 
our most valuable intellectual property is our collection of trademarks 
the protective steps we have taken in the past have been  and may in the future continue to be  inadequate to deter misappropriation of our trademark rights 
although we do not believe that we have suffered any material harm from misappropriation to date  we may be unable to detect the unauthorized use of  or take appropriate steps to enforce  our trademark rights in a timely manner 
we have registered some of our trademarks in the americas  europe  asia and australia and have other trademark applications pending in each of those regions 
effective trademark protection may not be available in every country in which we offer or intend to offer our products and services 
failure to adequately protect our trademark rights could damage or even destroy the red hat brand and impair our ability to compete effectively 
furthermore  defending or enforcing our trademark rights could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources 
risks related to our financial results and condition we have incurred substantial net losses on a gaap basis in the past and may not be able to maintain profitability 
we have incurred net losses in seven of our previous nine fiscal years 
as of february   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
while we have achieved profitability in fiscal of million  we cannot be certain that we will be able to sustain profitability 
failure to remain profitable may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and our ability to raise capital and continue operations 
you should not rely on our quarterly results of operations as an indication of our future results 
due to the unpredictability of the technology spending environment  our revenue and operating results have fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
we base our current and projected future expense levels in part on our estimates of future revenue 
our expenses are  to a large extent  fixed in the short term 
we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough to protect our projected operating results for a quarter if our revenue in that quarter falls short of our expectations 
if our future operating results fall below expectations of securities analysts or investors  the market price of our common stock may decline 
we may not be able to effectively attract additional enterprise customers and preserve relationships with current enterprise customers  which could adversely affect revenue 
historically  we focused our sales and marketing efforts on product sales to individuals 
in late fiscal  we began to focus the predominant portion of our sales and marketing efforts on expanding our enterprise customer base 
to this end  we have invested extensively to attract enterprise customers 
while we have been successful to date in acquiring large enterprise customers  if we are unsuccessful in gaining additional large enterprise customers in the future or in securing subscription renewals from existing enterprise customers  it will adversely affect our future revenue 
in addition  while our subscription agreements generally provide for renewals at prices that are the same as those in effect during the initial term or at then current list prices  there can be no assurance that customers will renew their subscription agreements at the end of the initial or any renewal term or that customers will not seek to condition any renewal on reduced prices 
any failure to obtain customer renewals  or reduction in prices upon renewal  could reduce future revenues 
we may not be able to continue to attract capable management personnel 
over the past three years we have built our management team during a time of significant unemployment and downturn in the technology sector 
this has given us the opportunity to attract highly capable management personnel 
however  our ability to retain key management personnel or hire capable new management personnel as we grow may be challenged if the technology sector rebounds and or if companies with more generous compensation packages or greater perceived growth opportunities compete for the same personnel 
we depend on our key personnel 
our future success depends on the continued services of a number of key officers  including our chief executive officer and president  matthew j 
szulik  our executive vice president engineering  paul cormier  our executive vice president chief financial officer  kevin b 
thompson and our executive vice president worldwide sales  alex pinchev 
the loss of the technical knowledge and industry expertise of any of these individuals could seriously impede our success 
moreover  the loss of one or a group of our key employees  particularly to a competitor  and any resulting loss of customers could reduce our market share and diminish the red hat brand 
we may lack the financial and operational resources needed to increase our market share and compete effectively with unix operating systems providers  microsoft  other established operating systems developers  software development tools developers  and certain infrastructure service providers 
in the market for operating systems  we face significant competition from larger companies with greater financial resources and name recognition than we have 
these competitors  which offer hardware independent multi user operating systems for intel platforms and or unix based operating systems  include microsoft  novell  ibm  sun microsystems  hewlett packard and unisys 
in the future  these competitors may develop and market a competing open source operating system 
as we increase our services offerings  we may face competition from larger companies that currently provide service and training related to the linux operating system as well as other operating systems  particularly unix based operating systems  due to the fact that linux and unix based operating systems share many common features 
these companies  including ibm and hewlett packard  may be able to leverage their existing service organizations and provide higher levels of consulting and training on a more cost effective basis than we can 
we may not be able to compete successfully with current or potential competitors 
we may not be able to meet the operational and financial challenges that we will encounter as our international operations  which represented approximately of our total revenue for the year ended february   continue to expand 
our international operations accounted for of total revenue for the year ended february  as we expand our international operations  we will face a number of additional challenges associated with the conduct of business overseas 
for example we may have difficulty managing and administering a globally dispersed business  fluctuations in exchange rates may negatively affect our operating results  we have to comply with a wide variety of foreign laws  we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights overseas due to the uncertainty of laws and enforcement in certain countries relating to the protection of intellectual property rights  export controls and times of crisis could prevent us from shipping our products into and out of certain markets  changes in import export duties and quotas could affect the competitive pricing of our products and services and reduce our market share in some countries  and economic or political instability in some international markets could result in the forfeiture of some foreign assets and the loss of sums spent developing and marketing those assets 
any failure by us to effectively manage the challenges associated with the international expansion of our operations could adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the primary objective of red hat s investment activities is to preserve principal and liquidity while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents  short term and long term investments in a variety of highly rated fixed income securities  including both government and corporate obligations and money market funds 
the following table presents the fair value balances of our cash equivalents and short term and long term investments that are subject to interest rate risk by year of expected maturity and average interest rates as of february  in thousands year ending february  february  february  february  february  total cash equivalents average interest rate investments average interest rates red hat did not hold derivative financial instruments as of february   and has never held such investments 
foreign currency risk approximately of our fiscal revenues were generated by sales outside the united states 
we are exposed to significant risks of foreign currency fluctuation primarily from receivables denominated in foreign currency and are subject to transaction gains and losses  which are recorded as a component in determining net income 
additionally  the assets and liabilities of our non us operations are translated into non us dollars at exchange rates in effect as of the applicable balance sheet dates  and the revenues and expenses of these operations are translated at average exchange rates during the month the transactions occur
