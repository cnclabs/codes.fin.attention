item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company builds satellite ground systems for command and control  integration and test  data processing  and simulation 
since its inception in  the company has provided ground systems for over different satellite missions for communications  science  meteorology  and earth resource applications 
the company has an established domestic and international customer base that includes government and commercial satellite operators  spacecraft and payload manufacturers  and aerospace systems integrators 
the company has developed innovative software products that reduce the cost and minimize the development risk associated with traditional custom built systems 
the company believes that it was the first to offer a comprehensive cots software product line for command and control 
as a systems integrator  the company leverages these products to provide turnkey satellite control facilities that can operate multiple satellites from most manufacturers 
these systems offer significant cost savings for customers that have traditionally purchased a separate custom control center for each of their satellites 
through its wholly owned subsidiary  sat  acquired in august  the company also offers turnkey systems and software for satellite and terrestrial communications signal monitoring 

table of contents in march  the company formed a wholly owned subsidiary  isi europe  with headquarters in toulouse  france 
isi europe serves as the focal point for the support of all of integral s european business 
on january   the company acquired newpoint 
newpoint provides equipment monitoring and control software to satellite operators and the telecommunications industry 
in october  the company acquired rt logic 
rt logic manufactures satellite communications equipment and systems  principally for military applications 
this equipment is used in satellite tracking stations  control centers  spacecraft factories  and range facilities 
in july  the company acquired the intellectual property rights  inventory and certain other assets of the former jackson tull satellite ground systems division 
the acquisition was an extension of the satellite ground systems business segment and enabled the company to be a turnkey provider of full motion antennas and rf systems used for tracking low earth orbiting satellites and launch vehicles as well as aeronautical telemetry range operations 
effective november   the company disposed of the intellectual property rights  inventory and certain other assets of antenna systems division to ljt associates  inc of montgomery  alabama ljt 
the disposition is effective november  as consideration  ljt agreed to pay the company  and executed a promissory note requiring payment of that sum in eight equal installments of  due on july and january beginning on july  as additional consideration  ljt agreed to make future contingent payments to the company for the period beginning november  through december  the contingent payments are calculated every december beginning december  based on pretax income as defined in the acquisition agreement 
under the asset sale agreement  the company will continue to fulfill its obligations under existing customer contracts but will look to ljt as a subcontractor to perform the actual work 
the company does not expect to record a material gain or a loss as a result of this transaction 
contract revenue the company generates revenue under three types of contracts fixed price  cost plus  and time and material t m contracts 
under a fixed price contract  the company is paid a stipulated price for services or products and bears the risk of increased or unexpected costs 
revenue under a fixed price contract is recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting based on costs incurred in relation to total estimated costs 
under a cost plus contract  the company is reimbursed for allowable costs within the contractual terms and conditions and is paid a negotiated fee 
the fee may be fixed or based on performance incentives 
revenue recognition under a cost plus contract is based upon actual costs incurred and a pro rata amount of the negotiated fee 
under a t m contract  the company receives fixed hourly rates intended to cover salary costs attributable to work performed on the contract and related overhead expenses  reimbursement for other direct costs and a profit 
revenue is recognized under a t m contract at the contractual rates as labor hours and direct expenses are incurred 
to date  the vast majority of contracts for the purchase of the company s cots software products have been fixed priced in nature  either firm fixed price contracts  or t m contracts with fixed labor rates 
the company earns revenues from sales of its products and services through contracts that are funded by the us government as well as commercial and international organizations 
the company may be either a prime contractor directly to the end user of its products and services or it may act as a subcontractor under a contract with another contractor 

table of contents the percentages of revenues received by the company from prime contracts and subcontracts for fiscal years  and are as follows fiscal year contract source prime contract subcontract for a given contract  the revenue mix may include the company s cots software products  pass through of third party hardware and software and services provided by the company or its subcontractors 
the following table summarizes the percentage of revenues attributable to each contract type for the period indicated fiscal year contract type cost plus fixed price time and materials sale of software products most of the company s contracts include the sale of proprietary software products 
sales of the company s software products take many forms 
the company sells software only a software only sale  software and services together or software  services and hardware together 
in addition  depending on a customer s requirements  the company may or may not provide post contract customer support pcs 
the company s recognition of revenue for sales of software products depends on customer requirements and the nature of the contracts involved 
in accordance with sop  software revenue recognition  for a software only sale  the company recognizes revenue when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the vendor s fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
in situations where software is sold together with services and or hardware  the company recognizes software license revenue on a percentage of completion basis 
the company recognizes pcs revenue on a percentage of completion basis when pcs is part of a broader fixed price contract that includes software and services 
alternatively  when pcs services ie  software maintenance and support are awarded to the company under a separate maintenance contract  the company recognizes pcs revenue on a straight line basis pro rata over the term of the maintenance contract 
during fiscal year  the company incurred approximately million in research and development r d costs in connection with software products 
backlog the company s estimated backlog is as follows in thousands sept 
 sept 
 sept 
 outstanding commitments general commitments total represents orders that are firm and funded 
represents orders that are firm but not yet funded and contracts awarded but not yet signed 

table of contents the increase in backlog between fiscal and fiscal relates to increased bookings at both rt logic and the commercial division in the ground systems segment 
the increase in backlog between fiscal and fiscal relates primarily to backlog at rt logic 
under outstanding commitments  the company agrees to provide specific services  frequently over an extended period of time  with continued performance of those services contingent upon the customer s year to year decision to fund the contract 
general commitments consist of contract options and sole source business that management believes likely to be exercised or awarded in connection with existing contracts 
contract options are the company s contractual agreement to perform specifically defined services only in the event the customer thereafter requests the company to do so 
sole source business refers to contract work which the company reasonably expects to be awarded based on its unique expertise in a specific area or because it has previously done all such work in that area for the customer or prime contractor who will award the contract 
the company estimates that of backlog as of september  will be completed during fiscal year estimated backlog includes contract options through june  including general commitments 
many of the company s contracts are multi year contracts and contracts with option years  and portions of these contracts are carried forward from one year to the next as part of the company s contract backlog 
the company s total contract backlog represents management s estimate of the aggregate unearned revenues expected to be earned by the company over the life of all of its contracts  including option periods 
because many factors affect the scheduling of projects  there can be no assurance as to when revenues will be realized on projects included in the company s backlog 
in addition  although contract backlog represents only business which is considered to be firm  there can be no assurance that cancellations or scope adjustments will not occur 
the majority of backlog represents contracts under the terms of which cancellation by the customer would entitle the company to all or a portion of its costs incurred and potential fees to the date of cancellation 
however  the company also believes that backlog is not necessarily indicative of future revenues 
the company s backlog typically is subject to large variations from quarter to quarter as existing contracts are renewed or new contracts are awarded 
additionally  all us government contracts included in backlog may be terminated at the convenience of the government 
critical accounting policies the company believes the following accounting policies are critical to the understanding of the company s financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition the company provides services under fixed price contracts for which revenue is generally recognized using the percentage of completion method based on the relationship of actual costs incurred to total costs estimated over the duration of the contract 
these estimates regarding costs underlie the company s determinations as to overall contract profitability and the timing of revenue recognition 
if the company does not accurately estimate the resources required or the scope of the work to be performed  or does not manage its projects properly within the planned periods of time or satisfy its obligations under the contracts  then actual results may differ from projected results and losses on contracts may need to be recognized 
revenue results are difficult to predict  and any shortfall in revenue or delay in recognizing revenue could cause the company s operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the ultimate realization of individual accounts receivable balances  including the credit worthiness of each customer and the period in which customers financial condition deteriorate and they are no longer able to pay the balances owed to the company 
to the extent the company does not recognize deterioration in its customers financial condition in the period it occurs  or to the extent the company overestimates its customers ability to pay  the amount of bad debt expense recognized in a given reporting period will be impacted 
goodwill and other intangible assets the company s acquisitions of other companies have resulted in the acquisition of certain intangible assets and goodwill 
goodwill is subject to impairment to the extent the company s operations experience significant negative results 
these negative results can be the result of the company s individual operations or negative trends in the company s industry or in the general economy  which impact the company 
to the extent the company s goodwill is determined to be impaired  then these balances are written down to their estimated fair value on the date of the impairment 
the company conducts an annual review for impairment and determining when and if an impairment has occurred involves a significant amount of judgment 
management bases its judgment on a number of factors including viability of the businesses acquired  their integration into the company s operations  the market in which those businesses operate and their projected future results  cash flow projections  and numerous other factors 
the results reported in any given period could be impacted by management s determination as to when an impairment has occurred 
recent accounting pronouncements in november  the emerging issues task force reached consensus on eitf issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
eitf provides a model for how to account for arrangements that may involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services and or rights to use assets 
the model requires that revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting if the arrangements meet certain criteria 
eitf is effective for fiscal periods beginning after june  the company s implementation of the guidance contained in eitf did not have a material effect on its financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity

monitoring control newpoint space communication systems rt logic intersegment total revenue revenue increased on a year to year basis for all of the company s operating segments 
revenue increases in the company s satellite ground systems segment pertain to increased sales volume as a result of the company s contract awards with the us air force specifically the ccs c and scnc programs that were made in the spring of revenue from this segment s air force customer increased approximately million  more than offsetting revenue decreases of million from noaa and revenue decreases of million in revenue from the segment s i t integration test division 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company disbanded the i t division and merged its operations with the segment s government and commercial divisions 
the remaining revenue increase from the segment approximately million is primarily attributable to increased revenue from the segment s antenna division that earned revenue for a full twelve month period in fiscal year as compared to only five months in fiscal year revenue levels for sat and newpoint were up and respectively in fiscal year compared to fiscal year and generally relate to increased bookings and increased shipments of new orders 
both sat and newpoint sell primarily to commercial satellite operators and commercial satellite users where market conditions have been depressed during the past few years 
the company believes that these markets are beginning to economically improve  as evidenced by the revenue increases in fiscal year  and if this improvement continues  the company believes that both sat and newpoint should be able to post continued revenue gains in future fiscal periods 
the company is also currently proposing both sat and newpoint products on several outstanding government bids 
the revenue generated by rt logic for fiscal year was the highest annual revenue in that subsidiary s history and is greater than the revenue posted in fiscal year cost of revenue gross margin the company computes gross margin by subtracting cost of revenue from revenue 
included in cost of revenue are direct labor expenses  overhead charges associated with the company s direct labor base and other costs that can be directly related to specific contract cost objectives  such as travel  consultants  equipment  subcontracts and other direct costs 
gross margins on contract revenues vary depending on the type of product or service provided 
generally  license revenues related to the sale of the company s cots products have the greatest gross margins because of the minimal associated marginal costs to produce the product 
by contrast  gross margins on equipment and subcontract pass throughs seldom exceed 
engineering service gross margins typically range between and 
these definitions and ratios generally apply across all segments

however  cost of revenue increases for the company s satellite ground systems segment were disproportionately greater than the revenue increases during the periods compared  resulting in a lower gross margin percentage for this segment for the current fiscal year compared to last fiscal year compared to 
the lower gross margin percentage for the segment is primarily attributable to contract overruns in the segment s newly established antenna division 
specifically  several antenna division contracts were under priced and under bid  primarily with respect to direct material and equipment costs 
during fiscal year  this division recorded million of direct material and equipment costs compared to revenue of only million leaving virtually no funding to cover direct labor and associated indirect costs 
during fiscal year in its entirety  the antenna division posted a gross margin deficit of million compared to a gross profit of approximately  during fiscal year this segment s product division also experienced a decline in gross margin of  between fiscal year and fiscal year as a result of decreased license revenues and increased product expenses 
the segment s i t division posted a million decrease in gross margin during the periods being compared as result of decreased revenues 
this division was disbanded during the fourth quarter of fiscal year the segment s government division more than offset the negative performance of the segment s antenna  product and i t divisions  recording increased gross margins from its air force customer in fiscal year of million on increased revenues of million 
these increases principally resulted from increased equipment and software deliveries on the fixed price portion of the company s ccs c contract with the air force 
the company typically experiences higher margins on its fixed price work than it does on its cost reimbursable contracts
