we currently maintain insurance to cover environmental conditions and business interruption if and when they occur 
this policy covers both governmental and third party claims associated with the covered environmental conditions 
our real property insurance policies exclude earthquake coverage for properties located within california 
as a result  we maintain a separate million blanket earthquake policy on the properties we own in northern and southern california 
our real property insurance policies exclude terrorism coverage 
however  we maintain a separate million blanket stand alone terrorism policy on the properties we own 
certain types of losses  however  generally of a catastrophic nature  such as acts of war  are either uninsurable or the cost of obtaining insurance is so high that it is more prudent to accept the risk of loss 
if more terrorists incidents occur  however  future insurance policies purchased by us may expressly exclude hostile acts  and it may then become economically unfeasible to obtain insurance covering terrorist attacks 
in the event of such terrorist acts or other catastrophic losses  we would expect our insurance premiums to increase thereafter  which may have an adverse impact on our cash flow 
we believe that our properties as of the date of this filing are adequately insured in accordance with industry standards

funds from operations is a widely recognized measure of reit operating performance 
funds from operations is a non gaap financial measure and  as defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts  means net income  computed in accordance with gaap excluding extraordinary items  as defined by gaap  and gains or losses from sales of property  plus depreciation and amortization on real estate assets  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships  joint ventures and subsidiaries 
we believe that funds from operations is helpful to investors and our management as a measure of our operating performance because it excludes depreciation and amortization  gains and losses from property dispositions  and extraordinary items  and  as a result  when compared year over year  reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates  rental rates  operating costs  development activities  general and administrative expenses  and interest costs  providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income 
in addition  our management believes that funds from operations provides useful information to the investment community about our financial performance when compared to other reits since funds from operations is generally recognized as the industry standard for reporting the operating performance of reits 
however  our funds from operations may not be comparable to funds from operations reported by other reits that do not define funds from operations exactly as we do 
we believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our operating results  funds from operations should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented in our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this form k 
we believe that net income is the most directly comparable gaap financial measure to funds from operations 
funds from operations does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity or our ability to make distributions 
funds from operations does not reflect either depreciation and amortization costs or the level of capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties  which are significant economic costs that could materially impact our results of operations

overview we are a self administered and self managed maryland reit

table of contents 
index to financial statements number of buildings net rentable square feet in millions office properties industrial properties total as an owner of real estate  the majority of our income and cash flow is derived from rental income received pursuant to tenant leases for space at our properties  and thus  our earnings would be negatively impacted by a deterioration of our rental income 
one or more factors could result in a deterioration of rental income including our failure to renew or execute new leases as current leases expire  our failure to renew or execute new leases with rental terms at or above the terms of in place leases  and tenant defaults 
our failure to renew or execute new leases as current leases expire or to execute new leases with rental terms at or above the terms of in place leases is dependent on factors such as the local economic climate  which may be adversely impacted by business layoffs or downsizing  industry slowdowns  changing demographics and other factors and local real estate conditions  such as oversupply of office and industrial space or competition within the market 
our industry s performance is generally predicated on a sustained pattern of job growth 
in  while the overall united states economy began to demonstrate economic growth  there were few indications that the economy was creating jobs at a pace sufficient to generate increased demand for our office space 
we continued to operate in a period of weak fundamentals  evidenced by relatively high vacancy and correspondingly lower rental rates 
as a result of the recent weak economic climate  the office real estate markets have been materially affected 
the contraction of office workforces has reduced demand for office space and overall vacancy rates for office properties increased in all of our markets through and our operations were adversely impacted 
in  vacancy rates appeared to peak in many of our markets and some positive net absorption of space started to occur 
of our four largest markets  the northern virginia metropolitan washington  dc  dallas fort worth  chicago and austin only northern virginia metropolitan washington  dcexperienced positive net absorption for the year ended december  however  during the fourth quarter of  the northern virginia  suburban chicago and austin markets experienced positive net absorption  while dallas fort worth and dowtown chicago experienced negative net absorption 
because vacancy rates remain high in most markets  we do not expect any material improvement in leasing conditions prior to the occupancy in our portfolio of operating properties decreased to at december  compared to at december  and at december  market rental rates have declined in most markets from peak levels and there may be additional declines in some markets in rental rates on our office space that was re leased in and decreased an average of and  respectively  in comparison to rates that were in effect under expiring leases

critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements 
our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of prentiss properties trust  our operating partnership and our other consolidated subsidiaries 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the reporting period 
actual results could differ from our estimates 
the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are fully described in note to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   included elsewhere in this form k 
however  certain of our significant accounting estimates are considered critical accounting estimates because the estimate requires our management to make assumptions about matters that 
table of contents 
index to financial statements are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and different estimates that reasonably could have been used in the current period  or changes in the estimates that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  would have a material impact on our financial condition  changes in financial condition or results of operations 
the audit committee of our board of trustees has discussed our critical accounting policies with management and with our independent auditors 
we consider our critical accounting policies and estimates to be those used in the determination of the reported amounts and disclosure related to the following impairment of long lived assets and the long lived assets to be disposed of  allowance for doubtful accounts  depreciable lives applied to real estate assets and improvements to real estate assets  initial recognition  measurement and allocation of the cost of real estate acquired  and fair value of derivative instruments 
impairment of long lived assets and long lived assets to be disposed of real estate  leasehold improvements and land holdings are classified as long lived assets held for sale or long lived assets to be held and used 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we record assets held for sale at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value  less cost to sell 
with respect to assets classified as held and used  we periodically review these assets to determine whether our carrying amount will be recovered 
all of our long lived assets were classified as held and used at december  our operating real estate  which comprises the majority of our long lived assets  had a carrying amount of billion at december  a long lived asset is considered impaired if its carrying amount exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
upon impairment  we recognize an impairment loss to reduce the carrying value of the long lived asset to our estimate of fair value 
our estimate of fair value and cash flows to be generated from our properties requires us to make assumptions related to future occupancy of our properties  future rental rates  tenant concessions  operating expenditures  property taxes  capital improvements  the ability of our tenants to perform pursuant to their lease obligations  the holding period of our properties and the proceeds to be generated from the eventual sale of our properties 
if one or more of our assumptions proves incorrect or if our assumptions change  the recognition of an impairment loss on one or more properties may be necessary in the future 
the recognition of an impairment loss would negatively impact earnings 
the table below details impairment losses recognized during the three years ended december  year ended december  in thousands impairment loss recognized included in the line item income from discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that we estimate to be uncollectible 
our receivable balance is comprised primarily of accrued rental rate increases to be received over the life of in place leases as well as rents and operating cost recoveries due from tenants 
we regularly evaluate the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts considering such factors as credit quality of our tenants  delinquency of payment  historical trends and current economic conditions 
at december   we had total receivables of million and an allowance for doubtful accounts of million  resulting in a net receivable balance of million 
of the million in total receivables  million represents accrued rental rate increases to be received over the life of in place leases 
it is our policy to reserve all outstanding receivables that are days past due along with a portion of the remaining receivable balance that we feel is uncollectible based on our evaluation of the outstanding receivable balance 
in addition  we increase our allowance for doubtful accounts for accrued rental rate increases  if we determine such future rent is uncollectible 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
if our assumptions  regarding the collectibility of accounts receivable  prove incorrect  we may experience write offs in excess of our allowance for doubtful accounts which would negatively impact earnings 
the table below presents bad debt expense recognized during the three years ended december   which includes increases or decreases to our allowance for doubtful accounts 
the table also presents our allowance for doubtful accounts at each period end

significant betterments made to our real estate assets are capitalized and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the betterment 
if our estimate of useful lives proves to be materially incorrect  the depreciation and amortization expense that we currently recognize would also prove to be materially incorrect 
a change in our estimate of useful lives would therefore  result in either an increase or decrease in depreciation and amortization expense and thus  a decrease or increase in earnings 
the table below presents real estate related depreciation and amortization expense included in both income from continuing operations and discontinued operations during the three years ended december  year ended december  in thousands depreciation and amortization expense initial recognition  measurement and allocation of the cost of real estate acquired we allocate the purchase price of properties acquired to tangible and identified intangible assets acquired based on their fair values in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations 
these fair values are derived as follows we record above market and below market in place lease values for acquired properties based on the present value using a market interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired of the difference between the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in place leases and management s estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in place leases  measured over a period equal to the remaining non cancellable term of the lease for above market leases and the initial term plus the term of the fixed rate renewal option  if any for below market leases 
we perform this analysis on a lease tenant by lease tenant basis 
the capitalized above market lease values are amortized as a reduction to rental income over the remaining non cancellable terms of the respective leases 
the capitalized below market lease values are amortized as an increase to rental income over the initial term plus the term of the fixed rate renewal option  if any  of the respective leases 
the aggregate value of other intangible assets in place leases acquired is determined by applying a fair value model 
our estimates of fair value for other intangibles in place leases includes an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease up periods for the respective spaces considering current market conditions  and the costs to execute similar leases 
in estimating the carrying costs that would have otherwise been incurred had the leases not been in place we include such items as real estate taxes  insurance and other operating expenses as well as lost rental revenue during the expected lease up period based on current market conditions 
costs to execute similar leases include leasing commissions  legal and other related costs 
the value of in place leases is amortized to expense over the remaining non cancelable term of the respective leases 
should a tenant terminate its lease  the unamortized portion of the in place lease value would be charged to expense 
amounts allocated to land are derived from comparable sales of raw land  floor area ratio far specifics of the land as compared to other developed properties average land cost per far and our other local market knowledge

index to financial statements amounts allocated to buildings and improvements are calculated and recorded as if the building was vacant upon purchase as the value associated with any in place or above or below market leases are allocated to such as discussed above

 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended and interpreted  beginning january   we record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation 
derivatives used to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset  liability  or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk  such as interest rate risk  are considered fair value hedges 
derivatives used to hedge the exposure to variability of expected future cash flows  or other types of forecasted transactions  are considered cash flow hedges 
for derivatives designated as fair value hedges  changes in the fair value of the derivative and the hedged item related to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings 
for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges  the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is initially reported in other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified to earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings  and the ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognized currently in earnings 
we assess the effectiveness of each hedging relationship by comparing the changes in fair value or cash flows of the derivative hedging instrument with the changes in fair value or cash flows of the designated hedged item or transaction 
for derivatives not designated as hedges  changes in fair value are recognized in earnings 
our objective in using derivatives is to add stability to interest expense and to manage our exposure to interest rate movements 
to accomplish this objective  we use interest rate swaps as part of our cash flow hedging strategy 
interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable rate amounts in exchange for fixed rate payments over the life of the agreements without the exchange of the underlying principal amount 
during  such derivatives were used to hedge the variable cash flows associated with a portion of our variable rate debt 
as of december   we did not have any derivatives designated as fair value hedges 
additionally  we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes and currently  we do not have any derivatives that are not designated as hedges 
to determine the fair value of our derivative instruments  we use a variety of methods and assumptions that are based on market conditions and risks existing at each balance sheet date 
for the majority of financial instruments including most derivatives  standard market conventions and techniques such as discounted cash flow analysis  option pricing models  replacement cost  and termination cost are used to determine fair value 
all methods of assessing fair value result in a general approximation of value  and such value may never actually be realized 
future cash inflows or outflows from our derivative instruments depend upon future borrowing rates 
if assumptions about future borrowing rates prove to be materially incorrect  the recorded value of these agreements could also prove to be materially incorrect 
because we use the derivative instruments to hedge our exposure to variable interest rates  thus effectively fixing a portion of our variable interest rates  changes in future borrowing rates could result in our interest expense being either higher or lower than might otherwise have been incurred on our variable rate borrowings had the rates not been fixed

index to financial statements liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents were million and million at december  and december   respectively 
the increase in cash and cash equivalents is a result of net cash flows provided by operating and financing activities exceeding net cash used in investing activities 
cash flows provided by operating activities totaled million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  net cash used in investing activities totaled million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in net cash used in investing activities of million is due primarily to an increase in cash generated from the sale of real estate of million  a decrease of million in cash used in the development and redevelopment of real estate  a decrease of million of cash used for the purchase of a mortgage loan in  partially offset by an increase of million in cash used to purchase real estate and an increase of million used for capital expenditures related to in service properties 
net cash provided by financing activities totaled million for the year ended december  compared to net cash used of  for the year ended december  the increase in net cash provided by financing activities of million is due primarily to a decrease of million of cash used related to the repurchase of preferred units in  an increase in cash generated from the sale of common shares of million  partially offset by a decrease in net borrowings of million and an increase of million in net cash used for distributions 
net cash flow from operations represents the primary source of liquidity to fund distributions  debt service  capital improvements and non revenue enhancing tenant improvements 
we expect that our revolving credit facility will provide for funding of working capital and revenue enhancing tenant improvements  unanticipated cash needs as well as acquisitions and development costs 
our principal short term liquidity needs are to fund normal recurring expenses  debt service requirements and the minimum distributions required to maintain our reit qualification under the internal revenue code 
our net cash flow from operations is generally derived from rental revenues and operating expense reimbursements from tenants and  to a limited extent  from fees generated by our office and industrial real estate management service business 
our net cash flow from operations is therefore dependent upon the occupancy level of our properties  the collectibility of rent from our tenants  the level of operating and other expenses  and other factors 
material changes in these factors may adversely affect our net cash flow from operations 
such changes  in turn  would adversely affect our ability to fund distributions  debt service  capital improvements and non revenue enhancing tenant improvements 
in addition  a material adverse change in our net cash flow from operations may affect the financial performance covenants under our revolving credit facility 
if we fail to meet any of our financial performance covenants  our revolving credit facility may become unavailable to us  or the interest charged on the revolving credit facility may increase 
either of these circumstances could adversely affect our ability to fund working capital and revenue enhancing tenant improvements  unanticipated cash needs  acquisitions and development costs 
in order to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes  we must distribute at least of our taxable income  excluding capital gains 
we expect to make distributions to our shareholders primarily based on our cash flow from operations distributed by our operating partnership 
we anticipate that our short term liquidity needs will be fully funded from cash flows provided by operating activities and  when necessary to fund shortfalls resulting from the timing of collections of accounts receivable in the ordinary course of business  from our revolving credit facility 
in the event that our cash flow needs exceed cash flows provided by operating activities  we may be forced to incur additional debt or sell real estate properties to fund such cash flow needs 
we expect to meet our long term liquidity requirements for the funding of activities  such as development  real estate acquisitions  scheduled debt maturities  major renovations  expansions and other revenue enhancing capital improvements through long term secured and unsecured indebtedness and through the issuance of additional debt and equity securities 
we also intend to use proceeds from our revolving credit facility to fund real estate acquisitions  development  redevelopment  expansions and capital improvements on an interim basis

index to financial statements debt financing as of december   we had outstanding total indebtedness  including our pro rata share of joint venture debt  of approximately billion  or approximately of total market capitalization based on a common share price of per common share

at the time of the modification  the in place loan had an outstanding balance of approximately million  an interest rate of and a maturity of august  per the modification  we received an additional million of cash borrowings resulting in a modified principal balance of million 
the loan as modified has an interest rate of per annum and a maturity date of january  the additional proceeds were used to repay a portion of the outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
on may   we completed a million  year unsecured term loan with a group of lenders headed by eurohypo ag  as administrative agent 
the loan requires interest only payments until maturity 
currently  interest is computed using a rate equal to day libor plus basis points 
based on overall leverage  the spread over day libor can fluctuate between basis point and basis points

the loans totaling million and million had fixed interest rates of and per annum and were scheduled to mature on december  and february   respectively 
on november   we negotiated an interest rate reduction on the million mortgage collateralized by our burnett plaza property in fort worth  texas 
the interest rate was reduced from day libor plus basis points to day libor plus basis points 
in exchange for the pricing reduction  we agreed to pay the principal balance of the loan down by million to million and agreed to a one year prepayment lockout from the date of the amendment 
the paydown was funded with proceeds from our revolving credit facility 
the other terms of the loan which included interest only payments until maturity and a maturity date of july  remain unchanged

the majority of our fixed rate secured debt contains prepayment provisions based on the greater of a yield maintenance penalty or of the outstanding loan amount 
the yield maintenance penalty essentially compensates the lender for the difference between the fixed rate under the loan and the yield that the lender would receive if the lender reinvested the prepaid loan balance in us treasury securities with a similar maturity as the loan

we were in compliance with these covenants at december  hedging activities to manage interest rate risk  we may employ options  forwards  interest rate swaps  caps and floors or a combination thereof depending on the underlying interest rate exposure 
we undertake a variety of borrowings from revolving credit facilities  to medium and long term financings 
to manage overall interest rate exposure  we use interest rate instruments  typically interest rate swaps  to convert a portion of our variable rate debt to fixed rate debt 
interest rate differentials that arise under these swap contracts are recognized as interest expense over the life of the contracts 
we may employ forwards or purchased options to hedge qualifying anticipated transactions

index to financial statements in connection with the disposition of a real estate property in may  we entered into a financial guarantee with a maximum future potential payment of million 
the financial guarantee  provided to the third party purchaser  guaranteed payment of an amount not to exceed the million potential maximum if certain tenants  as defined in the purchase and sale agreement  fail to extend either their leases beyond the maturities of their current in place leases or to perform according to their in place leases 
an amount totaling million was considered probable at the date of disposition and therefore  accrued during the year ended december  pursuant to the financial guarantee  during the year ended december   we paid an amount totaling million to the third party purchaser 
as a condition of the purchase and sale and as security for our guarantee  we provided to the title company at closing  two irrevocable letters of credit  totaling million  drawn on a financial institution and identifying the purchaser as beneficiary

funds from operations is a non gaap financial measure and  as defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts  means net income  computed in accordance with gaap excluding extraordinary items  as defined by gaap  and gains or losses from sales of property  plus depreciation and amortization on real estate assets  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships  joint ventures and subsidiaries 
we believe that funds from operations is helpful to investors and our management as a measure of our operating performance because it excludes depreciation and amortization  gains and losses from property dispositions  and extraordinary items  and  as a result  when compared year over year  reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates  rental rates  operating costs  development activities  general and administrative expenses  and interest costs  providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income 
in addition  our management believes that funds from operations provides useful information to the investment community about our financial performance when compared to other reits since funds from operations is generally recognized as the industry standard for reporting the operating performance of reits 
however  our funds from operations may not be comparable to funds from operations reported by other reits that do not define funds from operations exactly as we do 
we believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our operating results  funds from operations should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented in our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this form k 
we believe that net income is the most directly comparable gaap financial measure to funds from operations 
funds from operations does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity or our ability to make distributions 
funds from operations does not reflect either depreciation and amortization costs or the level of capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties  which are significant economic costs that could materially impact our results of operations 
the following is a reconciliation of net income to funds from operations

represents the minority interests applicable to the common unit holders of the operating partnership 
although the fee is not considered an extraordinary item in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  it is our opinion that it is appropriate to exclude the fee from funds from operations 
impairment losses on real estate are not added back in our reconciliation of net income to funds from operations  therefore  for periods in which impairment losses are recognized  funds from operations is negatively impacted 
we recognized impairment losses of million  million  and million during the years ended december   and  respectively 
therefore  funds from operations were negatively impacted for the years ended december    and by million  million  and million  respectively 
the impairment losses totaling million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively are included in the line item income from discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of income 
funds from operations decreased by million for the year ended december  from the year ended december  and increased by million for the year ended december  from the year ended december  as a result of the factors discussed in the analysis of operating results 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
in december  the financial standards board issued a revision to fasb interpretation no 
 fasb interpretation no 
r 
the interpretation  as revised  requires consolidation of an entity by an enterprise if that enterprise will absorb a majority of the entity s expected losses if they occur  receive a majority of the entity s expected residual returns if they occur  or both 
an entity subject to this interpretation is called a variable interest entity 
the disclosure provisions of this interpretation  as revised  are effective for financial statements issued after december  per this interpretation  as revised  a public entity  that is not a small business issuer  with a variable interest entity to which the provisions of the interpretation have not been applied as of december   shall apply this interpretation no later than the end of the first reporting period that ends after march  however  prior to the required application of this interpretation  a public entity  that is not a small business issuer  shall apply this interpretation to those entities that are considered to be special purpose entities no later than as of the end of the first reporting period that ends after december  at december   our operating partnership held a non voting interest in prentiss properties resources  inc which we accounted for using the equity method of accounting 
prentiss properties resources  inc was incorporated in march to serve as a taxable reit subsidiary and provide management and other services to our operating partnership and third party clients 
the management services business serves a broad base of clients  including major financial institutions and pension funds  large corporate users  real estate advisory firms and real estate investment groups 
through prentiss properties resources  inc we offer a full range of fee based services  including property management  leasing  tenant construction  insurance  accounting  tax  acquisition  disposition  facilities management  and corporate and asset management services

index to financial statements effective january   we acquired the remaining outstanding interest in prentiss properties resources  inc for consideration of approximately  as a result of this transaction  effective january   the accounts of prentiss properties resources  inc are consolidated with and into the accounts of our operating partnership 
had this transaction not occurred  prentiss properties resources  inc would have been subject to consolidation as prescribed in the revised interpretation 
we are currently evaluating whether our equity investments in broadmoor austin associates and tysons international partners qualify as variable interest entities and if so  determining whether we are the primary beneficiary  thus requiring consolidation 
in addition  we are evaluating whether the provisions of this interpretation will have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
in may  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
the statement established standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability or an asset in some circumstances 
it is to be implemented by reporting the cumulative effect of a change in an accounting principle for financial instruments created before the issuance date of the statement and still existing at the beginning of the interim period of adoption 
certain provisions of the statement that were to be initially effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  were deferred indefinitely by the financial accounting standards board 
as a result of the deferred provisions  which are discussed in fasb staff position  companies are not required to recognize non controlling interests of a limited life subsidiary as a liability in the consolidated financial statements 
in evaluating the provisions of the statement that were not deferred  due to the redemption provisions of our series e preferred units  we determined that our series e preferred units qualify as a mandatorily redeemable financial instrument and  thus  should be classified as a liability and measured at fair value in our consolidated balance sheet at december  we determined that the fair value of the series e preferred units equaled the million carrying amount at december  and as a result the reclassification had no impact on current period earnings 
application of and changes in law regarding ownership of subsidiaries and qualifications as a reit for federal income tax purposes  we were organized and have operated in conformity with the requirements for qualification as a reit under the internal revenue code of  as amended  beginning with our taxable year ending december  and through the date hereof 
the internal revenue code sets forth various income  asset  ownership  and distribution tests with respect to which a reit must comply in order to maintain its status as a reit 
although the internal revenue service  based upon its interpretation of the relevant judicial and administrative authorities  may take the position that a reit has failed a particular qualification test  the facts and circumstances upon which such a determination would be based are controlled by the reit 
to the extent that a reit does not comply with a particular test  the decision to take an action that would prevent compliance or to not take an action that would have allowed compliance will be directly within the control of the reit 
we are unaware of any instance in which a reit has lost its qualification as a reit due to the failure of one of the statutory qualification tests under the internal revenue code 
we believe that our current and proposed method of operation will enable us to continue to qualify as a reit 
the reit modernization act effective for and later years  contains several provisions affecting reits 
the reit modernization act allows a subsidiary to perform services for tenants without disqualifying the rents received as under prior law 
these subsidiaries  called taxable reit subsidiaries  are subject to taxation and are limited in the amount of debt and rental payments between the reit and the taxable reit subsidiaries 
the fair market value of all taxable reit subsidiaries securities cannot exceed of the reit s fair market value 
existing subsidiaries could be grandfathered in a one time tax free conversion 
they are not subject to these limitations  unless engaging in a new line of business or increasing assets 
if either of these events occurs  new restrictions on debt and rental payments will apply to these entities as well 
the reit modernization act also reduced the reit taxable income distribution requirement from to

index to financial statements inflation most of the leases on our properties require tenants to pay increases in operating expenses  including common area charges and real estate taxes  thereby reducing the impact on us of the adverse effects of inflation 
leases also vary in term from one month to years  further reducing the impact on us of the adverse effects of inflation 
risk factors an investment in us involves various risks 
the following describes factors that in some cases may have affected  and in the future could affect  our actual operating results and could cause such results to differ materially from those in any forward looking statements 
this list is not necessarily exhaustive  and new risk factors emerge from time to time 
we cannot assure you that the factors described below are all of the material risks to us at any specific point in time 
you should carefully consider the following factors which qualify in their entirety each forward looking statement 
risks related to general business operations the geographic concentration of our properties in markets which are in economic decline could have a material adverse effect on operating performance 
properties located in the mid atlantic  midwest  southwest  northern california and southern california provided approximately    and  respectively  of total rental income for the year ended december  like other real estate markets  these commercial real estate markets have experienced economic downturns in the past  and future declines in any of these economies or real estate markets could adversely affect our cash available for distribution 
our financial performance and ability to make distributions to our shareholders are  therefore  particularly sensitive to the economic conditions in these markets 
the local economic climate  which may be adversely impacted by business layoffs or downsizing  industry slowdowns  changing demographics and other factors  and local real estate conditions  such as oversupply of or reduced demand for office  industrial and other competing commercial properties  may affect our revenues and the value of our properties  including properties to be acquired or developed 
we cannot assure you that these local economies will grow in the future 
our acquisition of new properties which lack operating history with us give rise to difficulties in predicting revenue potential 
from time to time  we acquire office properties 
these acquisitions could fail to perform in accordance with expectations 
if we fail to accurately estimate occupancy levels  operating costs or costs of improvements to bring an acquired property up to the standards established for its intended market position  the operating performance of the property may be below our expectations 
acquired properties may have characteristics or deficiencies affecting their valuation or revenue potential that we have not yet discovered 
we cannot assure you that the operating performance of acquired properties will increase or be maintained under our management 
during  we acquired approximately million square feet of office property for gross consideration of approximately million 
some of these properties have had relatively short or no operating history under our management  therefore  we have had limited control over the operation of these buildings 
our ability to manage our growth effectively will require us to integrate successfully our new acquisitions into our existing management structure 
our redevelopment  development and construction activities may give rise to unexpected costs and can make it difficult to predict revenue potential 
we redevelop  develop and construct primarily office buildings 
the risks associated with these activities include abandonment of redevelopment or development opportunities resulting in a loss of invested capital  
table of contents 
index to financial statements construction costs of a property exceeding original estimates potentially resulting in yields on invested capital lower than expected  occupancy rates and rents at a newly renovated or completed property may not be sufficient to make the property profitable  financing may not be available on favorable terms for redevelopment or development of a property possibly increasing the projected cost of the project  permanent financing may not be available on favorable terms to replace short term construction loans and construction and lease up may not be completed on schedule  resulting in increased interest expense and construction costs  all necessary zoning  land use  building  occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations may not be obtained or may not be obtained on a timely basis resulting in possible delays  decreased profitability and increased management time and attention  and increased management time required for such activities may divert their attention from other aspects of our business 
these risks and potential costs may adversely affect our results of operations 
cost increases or revenue decreases can adversely affect property yields and values 
the yields available from equity investments in real estate depend in large part on the amount of income generated and expenses incurred 
if our properties do not generate revenues sufficient to meet operating expenses  including debt service  tenant improvements  leasing commissions and other capital expenditures  we may have to borrow additional amounts to cover fixed costs  and our cash flow and ability to make distributions to our shareholders will be adversely affected 
factors which may affect our revenues and the value of our properties include the national  state and local economic climate and real estate conditions  such as oversupply of or reduced demand for space and changes in market rental rates  the perceptions of prospective tenants of the safety  convenience and attractiveness of our properties  our ability to provide adequate management  maintenance and insurance  including coverages for earthquakes and terrorist acts  our ability to collect on a timely basis all rent from tenants  the expense of periodically renovating  repairing and reletting spaces  increasing operating costs  including real estate taxes and utilities  which may or may not be passed through to tenants  and our compliance with the laws  changes in the tax laws  fluctuations in interest rates and the availability of financing 
certain significant expenditures associated with our properties  such as mortgage payments  real estate taxes  insurance and maintenance costs  are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in rental revenues from our properties 
tenant defaults and bankruptcy could cause rent collection difficulties 
the risk that some of our tenants may declare bankruptcy is higher because of the recent decline in the economy 
a significant portion of our income is derived from rental income on our properties 
as of december   we had approximately  tenants  with the following tenants representing approximately of our aggregate annualized base rent and approximately of our total net rentable square footage international business machines  kaiser foundation health plan  northrop grumman corporation  general services administration  verizon communications  american management systems  computer associates  moore north america and at t 
currently  we derive approximately of our total annualized base rental revenue from tenants in the computer systems design  broadcasting  telecommunications  management  scientific  technical and insurance industries 
as a result  our distributable cash flow and ability to make expected distributions to our shareholders could be adversely affected if any of these industries is materially adversely affected by the economy 
table of contents 
index to financial statements or if a significant number of our tenants fail to pay their rent due to bankruptcy  weakened financial condition or otherwise 
our leases generally do not contain restrictions designed to ensure the creditworthiness of our tenants 
from time to time a tenant may experience a downturn in its business 
such a downturn may weaken its financial condition  and it may stop paying rent when due 
in addition  at any time  a tenant may seek the protection of the bankruptcy laws  which could result in delays in rental payments or in the rejection and termination of such tenant leases 
these events would cause a reduction in our cash flow and the amounts available for distributions to our shareholders 
we cannot assure you that tenants will not file for bankruptcy protection in the future or  if any tenants file  that they will affirm their leases and continue to make rental payments in a timely manner 
property maintenance costs may escalate beyond our ability to recover such costs through rents 
our properties are subject to increases in operating expenses  such as cleaning  electricity  heating  ventilation and air conditioning  elevator repair and maintenance  insurance and administrative costs  and other general costs associated with security  landscaping  and repairs and maintenance 
due to the terrorist acts of september   we have experienced increases in insurance premiums 
while our tenants generally are obligated to pay a portion of the escalating costs  there can be no assurance that our tenants will agree to pay such costs upon renewal or that new tenants will agree to pay such costs 
if operating expenses increase  the local rental market may limit the extent to which rents may be increased to meet increased expenses without decreasing occupancy rates 
our ability to make distributions to our shareholders could be adversely affected if operating expenses increase without a corresponding increase in revenues 
non renewal of leases and non reletting of space could adversely affect our rental revenues 
we are subject to several risks upon expiration of leases for space located at our properties 
the leases may not be renewed  the space may not be relet or the terms of renewal or reletting  including the costs of required renovations  may be less favorable than current lease terms 
leases on a total of approximately of the total net rentable square feet in our properties will expire during if we are unable to relet promptly or renew the leases for a particular property or properties or if the rental rates upon such renewal or reletting are significantly lower than expected rates or if our budgets for these purposes prove to be inadequate  then our cash flow and ability to make expected distributions to our shareholders may be adversely affected 
some of our competitors in markets in which we have properties may have newer  better located or better capitalized properties 
numerous office and industrial properties compete with our properties in attracting tenants to lease space 
in each market we compete on a number of factors including rental rates  tenant concession allowances  quality and location of buildings  quality of property management and other economic and non economic factors 
our competitors may have greater financial resources than are available to us and or they may be willing to rent space at lower rental rates or provide greater leasing concessions 
our major competitors in each market include the following companies

southern california arden realty  carramerica realty corp  equity office properties  kilroy realty corp  rreef this competition could have an adverse effect on our operating performance because some of these competing properties may be newer  better located or better capitalized than our properties 
properties with environmental problems could cause us to incur clean up costs or other liabilities 
various federal  state and local environmental laws  ordinances  and regulations impose liability upon a current or previous owner or operator of real property for the costs of removal or remediation of contamination caused by hazardous or toxic substances or other wastes at the property 
these laws often impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of  or was responsible for  the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances or other waste 
in addition  the presence of property contamination  or the failure to remediate contamination at a property properly  may adversely affect a party s ability to borrow using the real property as collateral 
persons who generate or arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances or other wastes may also be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of contamination at a disposal or treatment facility  whether or not such facility is or ever was owned or operated by them 
environmental laws and common law principles also impose liability upon a party for the release of and exposure to environmental contamination  including asbestos containing materials into the air  and third parties may use these laws to seek recovery from owners or operators of property for personal injury or property damage associated with environmental contamination  including asbestos containing materials 
as the owner of the properties  we may be liable for these types of costs 
we obtain environmental site assessments on all of our properties prior to their acquisition 
the purpose of environmental site assessments is to identify potential recognized environmental conditions that may be associated with a property 
for a number of our properties  the environmental site assessments also referenced prior phase ii environmental site assessments which involved subsurface sampling and analysis on such properties 
the previously mentioned environmental site assessments have not revealed any potential recognized environmental conditions that we believe could have a material adverse effect on our business  assets or results of operations 
however  it is possible that the previously mentioned environmental site assessments relating to any one of our properties do not reveal all adverse environmental conditions 
in addition  there could be environmental conditions that were created at a property after the applicable environmental site assessment was completed 
effective january   we renewed our insurance which covers environmental conditions and business interruption if and when they occur 
this policy covers both governmental and third party claims associated with the covered environmental conditions 
our limits for loss under the policy are million per occurrence and million in the aggregate 
we cannot assure you that these coverages will be sufficient to cover all costs of environmental issues that could arise

index to financial statements americans with disabilities act compliance could lead to unanticipated costs 
the americans with disabilities act of requires specified public accommodations to meet federal requirements governing accessibility for persons with disabilities related to access and use by disabled persons 
compliance with the americans with disabilities act could require modifications to our properties 
non compliance could result in  among other things  various penalties including injunctive relief and monetary damages 
although we have no basis for believing that our properties are not in compliance with the requirements of the americans with disabilities act  if we were required to make unanticipated expenditures to comply with the americans with disabilities act  our cash flow and the amounts available for distributions to our shareholders may be adversely affected 
some of our properties may be subject to uninsured losses such as from earthquakes or acts of terrorism 
we carry comprehensive liability  fire  flood and  where appropriate  extended coverage and rental loss insurance with respect to our properties  with policy specifications  exclusions  deductibles and insured limits customarily carried for similar properties 
there are  however  certain types of losses  such as from wars  that may be either uninsurable or the cost of obtaining insurance would be so high that it would be more prudent to accept the risk of loss 
we currently maintain a separate million blanket earthquake policy on the properties we own in northern and southern california and a separate million blanket terrorism policy on all our properties 
should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur  we could lose both capital invested in a property as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property but would continue to be obligated on any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the property 
any such loss would adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if another terrorist incident occurs  however  insurance policies purchased by us may expressly exclude hostile acts  and it may be impossible to obtain insurance covering terrorist attacks 
in the event of such terrorist acts or other catastrophic losses  we may not be able to purchase policies in the future with coverage limits and deductibles similar to those that are currently in place and if such event occurs  we would expect our insurance premiums to increase thereafter 
property ownership through partnerships and joint ventures could subject us to the contrary business objectives of our partners or co venturers 
through prentiss properties acquisition partners  lp  our operating partnership  we own non controlling interests in real estate  including a non controlling interest in the broadmoor austin associates and a non controlling interest in tysons international partners  which in the aggregate represented approximately million  or of our net income for the year ended december  our pro rata share of mortgage debt related to these unconsolidated interests is approximately million  or of our total debt outstanding  as of december  through these interests  we act as managing venture partner and have the authority to conduct business affairs of each joint venture  subject to approval and veto rights of the other venture partner 
we may also participate with other entities in property ownership or in providing property related services through joint ventures or partnerships 
partnership or joint venture investments may involve risks such as the following our partners or co venturers might become bankrupt  our partners or co venturers might at any time have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals  and our partners or co venturers may be in a position to take action contrary to our instructions or make requests contrary to our policies or objectives 
we will  however  seek to maintain sufficient control of such partnerships or joint ventures to achieve our business objectives 
although our organizational documents do not limit the amount of available funds that we may invest in partnerships or joint ventures  our revolving credit facility requires lender consent for certain investments in land  development projects and joint ventures

worth  northern california and san diego orange county 
the partnership was initially owned by the operating partnership and was seeded by the transfer of several recent acquisitions including  wood oak drive a single office building containing approximately  net rentable square feet located in herndon virginia  corporate lakes iii a single office building containing approximately  net rentable square feet located in chicago illinois  and seven office buildings containing approximately  net rentable square feet located in carlsbad california 
pursuant to a joint venture agreement  effective february   stichting pensioenfonds abp  a netherlands based pension fund  acquired a limited partnership interest in prentiss office investors  lp for proceeds totaling million 
the joint venture will be consolidated with and into the accounts of the operating partnership 
pursuant to its limited partnership agreement  prentiss office investors  lp will engage in a series of transactions pursuant to which it intends to acquire approximately to class a office properties over an to month period in the geographic regions within the united states in which we currently conduct business 
class a office properties will not be acquired after the initial month investment period unless our operating partnership  as general partner of prentiss office investors  lp  and stichting pensioenfonds abp  as limited partner of prentiss office investors  lp  mutually agree to amend the limited partnership agreement to provide for a longer investment period 
prentiss office investors  lp anticipates incurring indebtedness in an aggregate amount of up to of the undepreciated acquisition costs of all of the properties owned by prentiss office investors  lp as a result  pursuant to its limited partnership agreement  prentiss office investors  lp has the authority to invest up to million during its month investment period  which will include equity contributed to prentiss office investors  lp and the indebtedness in an aggregate amount up to of the undepreciated acquisition costs of all properties acquired by the partnership 
in the future  we may acquire limited partnership interests in property partnerships without partnership management responsibility or co venturer interests or co general partnership interests in property partnerships with shared responsibility for managing the affairs of the property partnership or joint venture 
in these instances  we will not be in a position to exercise sole decision making authority regarding the property partnership or joint venture 
our properties are illiquid assets 
our investments in properties are relatively illiquid 
this illiquidity will tend to limit our ability to vary our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions 
some of our properties are mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness 
if we were unable to meet our mortgage payments  the lender could foreclose on the properties and we could incur a loss 
in addition  if we wished to dispose of one or more of the mortgaged properties  we might not be able to obtain a release of the lien on the mortgaged property 
if a lender forecloses on a mortgaged property or if a mortgage lien prevents us from selling a property  our cash flow available for distribution to our security holders could decline 
our incurrence of debt could have a material adverse effect on operating performance 
if principal payments due at maturity cannot be refinanced  extended or paid with proceeds of other capital transactions  such as the issuance of new equity capital  we expect that our cash flow will not be sufficient in all years to pay distributions at expected levels and to repay all maturing debt 
furthermore  if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing result in higher interest rates upon refinancing  the interest expense relating to such refinanced indebtedness would increase 
this increase would adversely affect our cash flow and the amounts available for distributions to our shareholders 
if a property is mortgaged to collateralize payment of indebtedness and we are unable to meet mortgage payments  the property could be foreclosed upon by or otherwise transferred to the mortgagee with a consequent loss of income and asset value 

table of contents 
index to financial statements our use of variable rate debt and derivative financial instruments may cause an increase in debt service 
we have incurred and may incur in the future indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates 
variable rate debt creates higher debt service requirements if market interest rates increase  which would adversely affect our cash flow and the amounts available for distributions to our shareholders 
as of december   we had million of floating rate debt out of total debt  including our pro rata share of joint venture debt  of billion 
we enter into interest rate swap agreements in the ordinary course of our business to hedge or modify our exposures to interest rate fluctuations 
of the floating rate debt  million was swapped to fixed rate debt through various interest rate protection contracts with maturity dates ranging from september to september while our use of these derivatives is intended to allow us to better manage certain risks  it is possible that  over time  mis matches may arise with respect to the derivatives and the cash market instruments they are intended to hedge 
discrepancies can also arise between the derivative and cash markets 
derivatives also have risks that are similar in type to the risks of the cash market instrument on which their values are based 
for example  in times of market stress  sharp price movements or reductions in liquidity in the cash markets may be related to comparable or even greater price movements and reductions in liquidity in the derivative markets 
further  the risks associated with derivatives are potentially greater than those associated with the related cash market instruments because of the additional complexity and potential for leverage 
in addition  derivatives may create credit risks  as well as legal  operational and other risks beyond those associated with the underlying cash market instruments on which their values are based 
credit risk involves the risk that a counterparty on a derivative transaction will not fulfill its contractual obligations 
in an effort to limit credit risk  we have a policy that requires the counterparty to the transaction to have a credit rating no lower than a by a nationally recognized rating agency at the time we enter into a derivative transaction 
there can be no assurance  however  that our hedging strategy or techniques and policies for minimizing credit and other risks associated with our hedging activity will be effective  that our profitability will not be adversely affected during any period of changes in interest rates or that the costs of hedging will not exceed the benefits 
if we are unable to replace construction loans with permanent refinancing  we may have to sell the development properties at a loss 
if new developments are financed through construction loans or if acquisitions are financed with short term bridge loans in anticipation of later  permanent financing  there is a risk that upon completion of construction or the maturity of the bridge loans  permanent financing may not be available or may be available only on disadvantageous terms 
as of december   we were not a party to any construction loan commitments 
in the event that we enter into such financing arrangements and upon maturity are unable to obtain permanent financing for these properties on favorable terms  we could be forced to sell such properties at a loss or the properties could be foreclosed upon by the lender and result in loss of income and asset value 
we depend on our direct and indirect subsidiaries dividends and distributions  and these subsidiaries creditors and preferred security holders are entitled to payment of amounts payable to them by the subsidiaries before the subsidiaries may pay any dividends or distributions to us 
substantially all of our assets consist of our partnership interests in prentiss properties acquisition partners  lp  our operating partnership 
our operating partnership holds substantially all of its properties and assets through subsidiaries 
our operating partnership  therefore  depends for substantially all of its revenue on cash distributions to it by its subsidiaries 
the creditors of each subsidiary are entitled to payment of the subsidiary s obligations to them  when due and payable  before distributions may be made by the subsidiary to our operating partnership 
thus  our operating partnership s ability to make distributions to its unit holders depends on its subsidiaries ability to satisfy their obligations to their creditors and make distributions to our operating partnership 
in addition  the right of our operating partnership unit holders to participate in any distribution of the assets of any of our operating partnership s direct or indirect subsidiaries upon the liquidation  reorganization or insolvency of the subsidiary  and any consequent right of our operating partnership unit holders to participate in those assets  will be subject to the claims of the creditors and preferred security holders  if any  of the subsidiary 
furthermore  the holders of preferred units of our operating partnership are entitled to receive preferred distributions before payment of distributions to holders of operating partnership common units  including us 
thus  our ability to pay dividends to holders of our common shares depends on our operating partnership s ability first to satisfy its obligations to its creditors and make

these preferred units  the series b preferred units and series e preferred units  have preference over our common shares 
the series b preferred units have a total liquidation value of approximately million  and the series e preferred units have a total liquidation value of approximately million 
in addition  our shareholders will have the right to participate in any distribution of the assets of any of our direct or indirect subsidiaries upon the liquidation  reorganization or insolvency of the subsidiary  and consequently to participate in those assets  only after the claims of the creditors  including trade creditors  and preferred security holders  if any  of the subsidiary are satisfied 
subsequent to december   we redeemed both our series b preferred units and our series e preferred units at par value plus accrued and unpaid dividends 
risks related to our company our shareholders ability to effect a change of control may be limited 
we have a shareholder rights plan 
in february  we adopted a shareholder rights plan and declared a dividend of one purchase right for each common share of beneficial interest 
the purchase rights may have the effect of delaying  inhibiting or preventing a transaction or a change in control of us that might involve a premium price for the common shares or otherwise be in the best interest of our shareholders 
the purchase rights can cause substantial dilution to a person or group that acquires or more of our outstanding common shares unless the purchase rights have been redeemed by our board of trustees 
however  because the purchase rights are redeemable by our board of trustees  the purchase rights should not interfere with any merger or other business combination approved by our board of trustees 
we have an ownership limitation 
in order to maintain our qualification as a reit under the internal revenue code of  as amended  no more than in value of our outstanding shares of beneficial interest may be owned  directly or indirectly  by five or fewer individuals during the last half of our taxable year  other than our taxable year 
to ensure that we will not fail to qualify as a reit  our declaration of trust authorizes our board of trustees to take such actions as are necessary and desirable to preserve our qualification as a reit 
in addition  our declaration of trust has an ownership limitation which provides that no person may own  directly or indirectly  more than of the number of outstanding common shares  other than michael v 
prentiss  who currently may own up to of the number of outstanding common shares  or more than of the number of outstanding preferred shares of beneficial interest of any series 
the board of trustees  upon receipt of a ruling from the irs  an opinion of counsel or other evidence satisfactory to our board of trustees  may exempt a proposed transferee from the ownership limitation 
the board of trustees may not grant an exemption from the ownership limitation to any proposed transferee if such exemption would result in the termination of our status as a reit 
the ownership limitation may have the effect of delaying  inhibiting or preventing a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for the common shares or otherwise be in the best interests of our shareholders 
we have a staggered board 
our board of trustees is divided into three classes  each with a three year term  thus  only a portion of our board of trustees stand for election at each annual meeting 
the staggered terms of trustees may reduce the possibility of a tender offer or an attempt to change control of us  even though a tender offer or change in control might be in the best interest of our shareholders 

table of contents 
index to financial statements the board of trustees can issue additional shares 
our declaration of trust authorizes our board of trustees to amend our declaration of trust  without shareholder approval  to increase or decrease the aggregate number of shares of beneficial interest or the number of shares of beneficial interest of any class that we have the authority to issue  issue additional authorized but unissued preferred or common shares  and classify or reclassify any unissued common shares or preferred shares and to set the preferences  rights and other terms of such classified or unclassified shares 
these provisions may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for the common shares or otherwise be in the best interest of our shareholders 
our status as a reit is dependent on compliance with federal income tax requirements 
we have operated and intend to continue to operate as a reit for federal income tax purposes 
we have not requested  and do not expect to request  a ruling from the irs that the operating partnership and each of its non corporate subsidiaries have been and will be classified as partnerships for federal income tax purposes or that we qualify as a reit 
qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the internal revenue code  with limited judicial and administrative guidance available  to facts and circumstances that may be subject to differing interpretations for federal income tax purposes 
while we have operated and intend to continue to operate as a reit for federal income tax purposes  if the irs were to successfully challenge the tax status of the operating partnership or a non corporate subsidiary as a partnership  or if we fail to qualify as a reit for any taxable year  we would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates 
unless entitled to relief under the internal revenue code  we also would be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the disqualification year 
as a result  cash available for distribution would be reduced for each of the years involved 
although we intend to continue to operate as a reit  future economic  market  legal  tax or other considerations may cause our board of trustees  with the consent of our shareholders holding at least a majority of all the outstanding common shares  to revoke the reit election 
we have minimum distribution requirements that could require us to incur additional debt 
to qualify as a reit prior to  we were required to distribute at least of our net taxable income to our shareholders  excluding any net capital gain 
as a result of the reit modernization act  the distribution requirement was reduced to for and future years 
in addition  to avoid a non deductible excise tax  we must also distribute annually at least the sum of the following of our ordinary income for that year  of our capital gain net income for that year  and of our undistributed taxable income from prior years 
we have exceeded the distribution requirements in every year and we expect to comply with the distribution requirements 
if unfavorable market conditions exist  we may have to borrow funds on a short term basis to meet the reit distribution requirements 
if such unfavorable conditions occurred  we might not be able to fund all future capital needs with income from operations  and might have to rely on third party sources of capital  which may or may not be available on favorable terms 

table of contents 
index to financial statements changes in tax laws could affect our reit status 
at any time  future legislation or administrative or judicial decisions or actions could affect our tax treatment or qualification as a reit including tax liability  possibly with retroactive effect 
while we do not anticipate any such decisions or actions  the rules dealing with federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the irs and the us treasury department 
we cannot predict whether  when  in what forms  or with what effective dates  the tax laws applicable to us or an investment in us might be changed 
conflicts of interests in our business could result in decisions not in your best interest 
prentiss principals could have differing objectives from other shareholders upon the sale  refinancing or prepayment of indebtedness of properties 
messrs 
prentiss and august  our senior executive officers  and their affiliates may have unrealized taxable gain associated with their units of limited partnership interest in the operating partnership 
messrs 
prentiss and august may suffer different and more adverse tax consequences than our other shareholders upon the sale or refinancing of properties that were contributed to the operating partnership by messrs 
prentiss and august 
therefore  messrs 
prentiss and august and our other shareholders may have different objectives regarding the appropriate pricing and timing of any sale or refinancing of properties 
while we  through prentiss properties i  inc  the general partner of the operating partnership  have the exclusive authority as to whether and on what terms to sell or refinance an individual property  messrs 
prentiss and august may influence us not to sell  or refinance or prepay the indebtedness associated with properties even though such a transaction might otherwise be to our financial advantage  or may influence us to refinance properties with a high level of debt 
our policies with respect to conflicts of interests may not eliminate the influence of conflicts 
we have adopted policies intended to minimize conflicts of interest 
for example  our bylaws provide that all transactions in which executive officers or trustees have a conflicting interest with us may be subject to approval by a majority of our trustees that are not affiliated with any of our affiliates or by the holders of a majority of the common shares held by disinterested shareholders 
we have implemented a code of business conduct governing the conduct of all employees which further reduces the potential for conflicts of interest 
there can be no assurance that our policies will be successful in eliminating the influence of conflicts 
decisions could be made that might fail to reflect fully the interests of all our shareholders 
our declaration of trust includes a provision permitting each individual trustee to engage in the type of business activities conducted by us without first presenting any investment opportunities to us  even though such investment opportunities may be within the scope of our investment policies 
our board of trustees may change policies and incur debt without shareholder approval 
our board of trustees determines our investment  financing  borrowing and distribution policies  and our policies with respect to all other activities  including growth  capitalization and operations 
our board of trustees has adopted a policy limiting our total combined indebtedness plus our pro rata share of joint venture debt to or less of our total market capitalization  but our organizational documents do not contain any limitation on the amount of indebtedness we may incur 
although our board of trustees has no present intention to do so  these policies may be amended or revised at any time and from time to time at the discretion of our board of trustees  limited only by various restrictions in our credit agreements  without a vote of our shareholders 
our credit agreements limit total indebtedness to of total assets and require a debt service coverage ratio of at least to a change in our investment  financing  borrowing and distribution policies could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations or the market price of our common shares 
we are dependent on the services of michael v 
prentiss and thomas f

messrs 
prentiss and august have agreed in their employment agreements that for a period of two years after they are no longer employed by us they will not enter into employment with any company which is in a business that is competitive to our business 
if this provision  or if similar provisions in other employment agreements with our other employees  is determined to not be binding on messrs 
prentiss or august  or any other employee  those persons would be able to enter into employment with companies which compete with us immediately after those persons ceased to be employed by us 
our third party property management  leasing  development and construction business and related services involve relationships which may be subject to early termination or a lack of control 
through our operating partnership  prentiss properties resources  inc  and prentiss properties management  lp  we engage in the business of management  leasing  development and construction of properties owned by third parties 
risks associated with these activities include the following related contracts  which are typically cancelable upon days notice or upon specific events  including sale of the property  may be terminated by the property owner or may be lost in connection with a sale of such property  contracts may not be renewed upon expiration or may not be renewed on terms consistent with current terms  and rental revenues upon which management  leasing and development fees are based may decline as a result of general real estate market conditions or specific market factors affecting properties that we manage  lease or develop  resulting in decreased management  leasing or development fee income 
we have shares available for future sale that could adversely affect the price of our common shares 
under our declaration of trust  our board of trustees has the authority to do the following amend our declaration of trust  without shareholder approval  to increase or decrease the aggregate number of shares of beneficial interest or the number of shares of beneficial interest of any class  including common shares  that we have the authority to issue  and issue additional authorized but unissued common shares or preferred shares 
as of december   we have authorized  common shares  of which  common shares are either unissued or held in treasury for purposes other than the key employee share option plan 
in addition  we have granted options to purchase  common shares to executives officers  employees and trustees  of which options to purchase  common shares remain outstanding 
we have reserved a total of  common shares and  common shares for issuance upon conversion of the series d preferred shares and common units  respectively 
sales or issuances of a substantial number of common shares  or the perception that such sales could occur could adversely affect prevailing market prices of the common shares and dilute the percentage ownership held by our shareholders 
limited partners of our operating partnership have the right to receive  in our or the general partner s discretion  either cash or one common share  in exchange for each limited partnership unit they now hold  if and to the extent they tender such units for redemption 
as of december   there were  common units of our operating partnership outstanding and held by partners other than prentiss properties trust  and  if we or the general partner elect to redeem such units for common shares  these common units are exchangeable for  common shares 
we are party to registration rights agreements under which we are required to register the issuance of common shares which we may issue upon the redemption by the holders of units of limited partnership interest in our operating partnership 
we can make no prediction concerning the effect that such issuance or future sales of any such common shares will have on market prices 

table of contents 
index to financial statements changes in market conditions could hurt the market price of our shares 
the value of our common shares depends on various market conditions  which may change from time to time 
among the market conditions that may affect the value of our common shares are the extent of institutional investor interest in us  the reputation of reits generally and the attractiveness of their equity securities in comparison to other equity securities  including securities issued by other real estate companies  and fixed income securities  our financial condition and performance  and general financial market conditions 
in addition  the stock market in recent years has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies 
increased market rates may hurt the value of our shares 
we believe that investors consider the distribution rate on reit shares  expressed as a percentage of the price of the shares  relative to market interest rates as an important factor in deciding whether to buy or sell the shares 
if market interest rates go up  prospective purchasers of reit shares may expect a higher distribution rate 
higher interest rates would not  however  result in more funds for us to distribute and in fact  would likely increase our borrowing costs and might decrease our funds available for distribution 
thus  higher market interest rates could cause the market price of our common shares to decline 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risk exposure is to changes in interest rates as a result of our revolving credit facility and long term debt 
at december   we had outstanding total indebtedness  including our pro rata share of joint venture debt  of approximately billion  or approximately of total market capitalization based on a common share price of per common share 
our interest rate risk objective is to limit the impact of interest rate fluctuations on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs 
to achieve this objective  we manage our exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates for our borrowings through the use of fixed rate debt instruments to the extent that reasonably favorable rates are obtainable with such arrangement 
in addition  we may enter into derivative financial instruments such as options  forwards  interest rate swaps  caps and floors to mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument or to effectively lock the interest rate on a portion of our variable rate debt 
we do not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 
approximately of our outstanding debt was subject to fixed rates with a weighted average interest rate of at december  of the remaining million  or  representing our variable rate debt  million was effectively locked at an interest rate before the spread over libor  of through our interest rate swap agreements 
we regularly review interest rate exposure on our outstanding borrowings in an effort to minimize the risk of interest rate fluctuations 
the following table provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  including interest rate swaps and debt obligations 
for debt obligations outstanding at december   the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates for the debt outstanding during the periods 
the debt outstanding as presented in the table includes our pro rata share of joint venture debt 
for interest rate swaps  the table presents notional amounts that expire and weighted average interest rates for in place swaps during the period 
notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contract 
weighted average variable rates are based on day libor as of december  the fair value of our fixed rate debt indicates the estimated principal amount of debt having similar debt service requirements  which could have been borrowed by us at december  the rate assumed in the fair value calculation of fixed rate debt is equal to  representing our estimated borrowing rate for fixed rate debt instruments similar in term to those outstanding at december  the fair value of our variable to fixed interest rate swaps indicates the estimated amount that would have been paid by us had they been terminated at december

receive rate the table incorporates only those exposures that exist as of december  and does not consider exposures or positions which could arise after that date 
in addition  because firm commitments are not represented in the table above  the information presented therein has limited predictive value 
as a result  our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during future periods  prevailing interest rates  and our hedging strategies at that time 
there is inherent rollover risk for borrowings as they mature and are renewed at current market rates 
at december   our variable rate debt outstanding was approximately million with an average interest rate of approximately 
exclusive of our interest rate swap agreements  if day libor increased basis points  total interest expense would increase approximately million 
the total extent of market risk is not quantifiable or predictable because of the variability of future interest rates and our financing requirements
