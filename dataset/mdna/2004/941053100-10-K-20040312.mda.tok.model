item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected financial and operating data  our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere herein 
industry overview the solid waste industry is a very local and competitive business  requiring substantial labor and capital resources 
the participants compete for collection accounts primarily on the basis of price and the quality of service and compete for landfill business on the basis of tipping fees  geographic location and quality of operations 
the solid waste industry has been consolidating and continues to consolidate as a result of a number of factors  including the increasing costs and complexity associated with waste management operations and regulatory compliance 
many small independent operators and municipalities lack the capital resources  management  operating skills and technical expertise necessary to operate effectively in such an environment 
the consolidation trend has caused solid waste companies to operate larger landfills that have complementary collection routes that can use company owned disposal capacity 
controlling the point of transfer from haulers to landfills has become increasingly important as landfills continue to close and disposal capacity moves further from collection markets 
generally  the most profitable industry operators are those companies that are vertically integrated or enter into long term collection contracts 
a vertically integrated operator will benefit from the internalization of waste bringing waste to a company owned landfill  the ability to charge third party haulers tipping fees either at landfills or at transfer stations  and the efficiencies gained by being able to aggregate and process waste at a transfer station prior to landfilling 
the solid waste industry is experiencing continuing consolidation as companies seek to take advantage of economies of scale by increasing route densities and market share in hauling operations  and by reducing disposal expenses by owning landfill operations 
waste connections  inc is an integrated solid waste services company that provides solid waste collection  transfer  disposal and recycling services in mostly secondary markets in the western and southern us to meet the competitive and regulatory pressures within the solid waste services industry  we have developed a two pronged strategy 
in markets where we believe that owning landfills is a strategic element to a collection operation because of competitive and regulatory factors  we generally focus on providing integrated services  from collection through disposal of solid waste in landfills that we own or operate 
in markets where waste collection services are provided under exclusive arrangements  or where waste disposal is municipally funded or available at multiple municipal sources  we believe that controlling the waste stream by providing collection services under exclusive arrangements is often more important to our growth and profitability than owning or operating landfills 
executive overview in  we continued to execute our strategy of growth through acquisitions with tightly defined parameters for acquisition candidates 
despite a number of challenges  including a poor economy  negative internal volume growth in the first three quarters  and weather in certain markets that impacted operations  we maintained relatively consistent operating margins for the full year 
our revenue growth year over year was the result of acquisitions completed during  as well as the rollover effect from acquisitions closed in and price increases implemented in our base business 
the majority of acquisitions in occurred in the second half of the year  which resulted in approximately million of revenue growth in from acquisitions closed in we estimate that these acquisitions should contribute approximately million of rollover revenue growth in in general  acquired companies initially have lower operating margins than our consolidated average 
as such they tend to increase net income and earnings per share but initially reduce operating margins 
internal volume growth was negative in the first three quarters of primarily as a result of lower revenues from one time  event based projects relative to volume growth turned positive in the fourth quarter and is expected to be positive for full year in addition to the negative internal volume growth  some of our operations were adversely affected by weather in  which affected our ability to bring certain projects on line  further impacting volume growth and internalization efforts 
pricing is budgeted to be marginally stronger for the full year than experienced in throughout  we continued to increase internalization of waste we collected by disposing it at landfills we owned or operated 
we increased our internalization rate from in the first quarter to over in the fourth quarter 
higher levels of internalization tend to drive higher gross margins  higher levels of depletion expense and higher capital expenditures 
we expect our internalization rate to remain fairly constant at in  absent the influence of additional acquisitions completed in we invested million in capital expenditures in to upgrade and expand facilities  build more landfill capacity  automate routes in certain markets  and reduce the overall average life of our fleet 
despite the increased levels of capital expenditures  cash flow from operations exceeded capital expenditures and represented an increased portion of the consideration we paid for acquisitions 
we expect this trend to continue in we also expanded management infrastructure to help ensure commitments made by employees in budgets are implemented and to help improve under performing locations 
management infrastructure was also expanded in support of various regulatory and accounting oversight measures  in particular  the implementation of requirements under the sarbanes oxley act 
some of these additions occurred late in  which  combined with higher expected incentive compensation in  will result in higher overall sg a expenses in  though sg a as a percentage of revenue should remain about the same as in in addition  with safety incentives and management infrastructure put in place in and at the beginning of  we increased our focus on employee health and safety programs to reduce the frequency of incidents and contain risk management costs  which we effectively self insure 
two high rate interest rate swaps expired in early december  and we executed two lower rate interest rate swaps that began february the expiration of our high rate interest rate swaps should result in reduced interest expense in  absent a significant increase in overall interest rates this year or an acceleration of our acquisition program 
in addition  we refinanced our senior credit facility that was due in may and was scheduled to become current debt in may this refinancing also provided us with additional capacity to fund our growth strategy and the flexibility to call our million of convertible subordinated notes due april  which are first callable beginning april these notes are convertible into approximately million shares of common stock at a conversion price of and have an initial early call premium of 
these shares are included in our fully diluted share count used to calculate reported diluted earnings per share numbers 
our lenders have pre approved our ability to call the notes early 
on march   we announced that on april   we intend to redeem the notes in full 
if the holders elect to redeem their notes for cash  our diluted share count would decrease  which would increase our diluted earnings per share 
if the holders elect to convert the notes into common stock  our cash interest expense will decline by approximately million 
conversion would further strengthen our balance sheet and have no significant earnings impact as the conversion shares are already included in our diluted earnings per share calculation 
critical accounting estimates and assumptions the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements 
as described by the securities and exchange commission  critical accounting estimates and assumptions are those that may be material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change  and that have a material impact on the financial condition or operating performance of the company 
based on this definition  we believe the following are our critical accounting estimates 
self insurance liabilities 
during  we increased our scope of high deductible insurance  adding automobile liability  general liability and workers compensation claims 
previously  our high deductible insurance program covered only automobile collision and employee group health claims 
our insurance accruals are based on claims filed and estimates of claims incurred but not reported and are developed by our management with assistance from our third party actuary and our third party claims administrator 
the insurance accruals are influenced by our past claims experience factors  which have a limited history  and by published industry development factors 
if we experience insurance claims or costs above or below our historically evaluated levels  our estimates could be materially affected 
the frequency and amount of claims or incidents could vary significantly over time  which could materially affect our self insurance liabilities 
additionally  the actual costs to settle the self insurance liabilities could materially differ from the original estimates and cause us to revise our estimates of future costs 
accounting for landfills 
our adoption of sfas no 
on january  resulted in a significant change to our accounting policies for landfill closure and post closure obligations 
for additional information and analyses of the impact that adopting sfas no 
had on our balance sheet and our results of operations for the year ended december   see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
we recognize landfill depletion expense as airspace of the landfill is consumed 
our landfill depletion rates are based on the remaining disposal capacity at our landfills  considering both permitted and deemed permitted airspace 
landfill closure and post closure liabilities are calculated by estimating the total obligation in current dollars  inflating the obligation based upon the expected date of the expenditure and discounting the inflated total to its present value using a credit adjusted risk free rate 
the resulting closure and post closure obligation is recorded on the balance sheet as the landfill s total airspace is consumed 
the accounting methods discussed below require us to make certain estimates and assumptions 
changes to these estimates and assumptions could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations 
any changes to our estimates are applied prospectively 
landfill development costs 
landfill development costs include the costs of acquisition  construction associated with excavation  liners  site berms  groundwater monitoring wells and leachate collection systems 
we estimate the total costs associated with developing each landfill site to its final capacity 
total landfill costs include the development costs associated with deemed permitted airspace 
deemed permitted airspace is described below 
landfill development costs depend on future events and thus actual costs could vary significantly from our estimates 
material differences between estimated and actual development costs may affect our cash flows by increasing our capital expenditures and thus affect our results of operations by increasing our landfill depletion expense 
closure and post closure obligations 
we reserve for estimated closure and post closure maintenance obligations at the landfills we own and certain landfills that we operate  but do not own  under life of site operating contracts 
final capping costs are included in the calculation of closure and post closure liabilities 
we could have additional material financial obligations relating to closure and post closure costs at other disposal facilities that we currently own or operate or that we may own or operate in the future 
in  we calculated the net present value of our closure and post closure commitments assuming a inflation rate and an discount rate 
effective january   the inflation rate and discount rate that we will apply to changes in our estimated closure and post closure commitments are and  respectively 
the resulting closure and post closure obligation is recorded on the balance sheet as an addition to site costs and amortized as depletion expense as the landfill s total airspace is consumed 
significant reductions in our estimates of the remaining lives of our landfills  or significant increases in our estimates of the landfill closure and post closure maintenance costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  changes in regulatory or legislative requirements could increase our costs related to our landfills and result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
disposal capacity 
our internal and third party engineers perform surveys at least annually to estimate the remaining disposal capacity at our landfills 
our landfill depletion rates are based on the remaining disposal capacity  considering both permitted and deemed permitted airspace  at the landfills that we own and at the landfills that we operate  but do not own  under life of site operating contracts 
deemed permitted airspace consists of additional disposal capacity being pursued through means of an expansion 
deemed permitted airspace that meets certain internal criteria is included in our estimate of total landfill airspace 
the internal criteria we use to determine when deemed permitted airspace may be included as disposal capacity are as follows the land where the expansion is being sought is contiguous to the current disposal site  and we either own it or the property is under option  purchase  operating or other agreement  total development costs  final capping costs  and closure post closure costs have been determined  internal personnel have performed a financial analysis of the proposed expansion site and have determined that it has a positive financial and operational impact  internal or external personnel are actively working to obtain the necessary approvals to obtain the landfill expansion permit  we consider it probable that we will achieve the expansion 
for a pursued expansion to be considered probable  there must be no significant known technical  legal  community  business  or political restrictions or similar issues existing that could impair the success of the expansion  and the land where the expansion is being sought has the proper zoning or proper zoning can readily be obtained 
we may be unsuccessful in obtaining permits for deemed permitted disposal capacity at our landfills 
in such case  we will charge the previously capitalized development costs to expense 
this will adversely affect our operating results and cash flows and could result in greater landfill depletion expense being recognized on a prospective basis 
we periodically evaluate our landfill sites for potential impairment indicators 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on regulatory factors  market conditions and operational performance of our landfills 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that our landfill carrying costs are impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
impairment of intangible assets 
we periodically evaluate acquired assets for potential impairment indicators 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on regulatory factors  market conditions  anticipated cash flows and operational performance of our acquired assets 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill or other intangibles associated with our acquired businesses are impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could reduce our net worth and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  our credit agreement contains a covenant requiring us to maintain a minimum net worth 
a reduction in net worth  if substantial  could limit the amount that we can borrow under our credit agreement and any failure to comply with the agreement could result in an event of default under the credit agreement 
as of december   goodwill and intangible assets represented of our total assets 
allocation of acquisition purchase price 
we allocate acquisition purchase prices to identified intangible assets and tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition  with any residual amounts allocated to goodwill 
we deem the total remaining permitted and deemed permitted airspace of an acquired landfill to be a tangible asset 
therefore  for acquired landfills  we initially allocate the purchase price to identified intangible and tangible assets acquired  excluding landfill airspace  and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 
any residual amount is allocated to landfill airspace 
we often consummate single acquisitions that include a combination of collection operations and landfills 
for each separately identified collection operation and landfill acquired in a single acquisition  we perform an initial allocation of total purchase price to the identified collection operations and landfills based on their relative fair values 
following this initial allocation of total purchase price to the identified collection operations and landfills  we further allocate the identified intangible assets and tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed for each collection operation and landfill based on their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition  with any residual amounts allocated to either goodwill or landfill site costs  as discussed above 
general our revenues consist mainly of fees we charge customers for solid waste collection  transfer  disposal and recycling services 
our collection business also generates revenues from the sale of recyclable commodities  which have significant variability 
a large part of our collection revenues comes from providing commercial  industrial and residential services 
we frequently perform these services under service agreements  municipal contracts or franchise agreements with governmental entities 
our existing franchise agreements and all of our existing municipal contracts give us the exclusive right to provide specified waste services in the specified territory during the contract term 
these exclusive arrangements are awarded  at least initially  on a competitive bid basis and subsequently on a bid or negotiated basis 
we also provide residential collection services on a subscription basis with individual households 
more than of our revenues for the year ended december  were derived from market areas where services are provided predominantly under exclusive franchise agreements  long term municipal contracts and governmental certificates 
governmental certificates grant us perpetual and exclusive collection rights in the covered areas 
contracts with counties and municipalities and governmental certificates provide relatively consistent cash flow during the terms of the contracts 
because we bill most residential customers quarterly  subscription agreements also provide a stable source of revenues for us 
the table below shows for the periods indicated the percentage of our total reported revenues attributable to services provided  prior to intercompany eliminations 
year ended december  collection disposal and transfer recycling other we charge transfer station and landfill customers a tipping fee on a per ton and or per yard basis for disposing of their solid waste at the transfer stations and landfill facilities 
many of our transfer and landfill customers have entered into one to ten year disposal contracts with us  most of which provide for annual indexed price increases 
we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from services provided under exclusive municipal contracts and franchise agreements 
no single contract or customer accounted for more than of our revenues for the years ended december   and we typically determine the prices of our solid waste services by the collection frequency and level of service  route density  volume  weight and type of waste collected  type of equipment and containers furnished  the distance to the disposal or processing facility  the cost of disposal or processing  and prices charged by competitors for similar services 
the terms of our contracts sometimes limit our ability to pass on price increases 
long term solid waste collection contracts often contain a formula  generally based on a published price index  that automatically adjusts fees to cover increases in some  but not all  operating costs  or that limit increases to less than of the increase in the applicable price index 
cost of operations include labor and benefits  tipping fees paid to third party disposal facilities  equipment maintenance  workers compensation  vehicle insurance  claims expense  third party transportation expense  fuel  the cost of materials we purchase for recycling  district and state taxes and host community fees and royalties 
our single largest cost is labor  followed by third party disposal  cost of vehicle maintenance  taxes and fees and fuel 
we use a number of programs to reduce overall cost of operations  including increasing the use of automated routes to reduce labor and workman s compensation exposure  comprehensive maintenance and health and safety programs  and increasing the use of transfer stations to further enhance internalization rates 
during  we increased our scope of high deductible insurance  adding automobile liability  general liability and workers compensation claims 
previously  our high deductible insurance program covered only automobile collision and employee group health claims 
if we experience insurance claims or costs above or below our historically evaluated levels  our estimates could be materially affected 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses include management  sales force  clerical and administrative employee compensation and benefits  legal  accounting and other professional services  bad debt expense  and rent expense for our corporate headquarters 
depreciation expense includes depreciation of fixed assets over their estimated useful lives using the straight line method 
depletion expense includes depletion of landfill site costs and total future development costs as remaining airspace of the landfill is consumed 
remaining airspace at our landfills includes both permitted and deemed permitted airspace 
amortization expense includes the amortization of definite lived intangible assets  consisting primarily of long term franchise agreements and contracts and non competition agreements  over their estimated useful lives using the straight line method 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  consisting primarily of certain perpetual rights to provide solid waste collection and transportation services in specified territories  are not amortized 
we capitalize some third party expenditures related to pending acquisitions or development projects  such as legal  engineering and interest expenses 
we expense indirect acquisition costs  such as executive and corporate overhead  public relations and other corporate services  as we incur them 
we charge against net income any unamortized capitalized expenditures and advances net of any portion that we believe we may recover  through sale or otherwise that may become impaired  such as those that relate to any operation that is permanently shut down and any pending acquisition or landfill development project that we believe will not be completed 
we routinely evaluate all capitalized costs  and expense those related to projects that we believe are not likely to succeed 
at december   we had million in capitalized expenditures relating to pending acquisitions 
we own undeveloped property in harper county  kansas where we are seeking permits to construct and operate a municipal solid waste landfill 
in  we received a special use permit from harper county for zoning the landfill and in we received a draft permit from the kansas department of health and environment to construct and operate the landfill 
in july  the district court of harper county invalidated the previously issued zoning permit 
we have appealed the district court s decision to invalidate the zoning permit 
the kansas department of health and environment has notified us that it will not issue a final permit to construct and operate the landfill until the zoning matter is resolved 
at december   we had million of capitalized expenditures related to this landfill development project 
based on the advice of counsel  we believe that we will prevail in this matter and do not believe that an impairment of the capitalized expenditures exists 
if we do not prevail on appeal  however  we will be required to expense in a future period the million of capitalized expenditures  less the recoverable value of the undeveloped property and other amounts recovered  which would likely have a material adverse effect on our reported income for that period 
we continually evaluate the value and future benefits of our intangible assets  including goodwill 
we assess the recoverability from future operations using cash flows and income from operations of the related acquired businesses as measures 
under this approach  the carrying value is reduced if it becomes probable that our best estimate for expected future cash flows of the related business would be less than the carrying amount of the intangible assets 
as of december   there have been no adjustments to the carrying amounts of intangibles  including goodwill  resulting from these evaluations 
as of december   goodwill and other intangible assets represented of total assets and of stockholders equity 
results of operations the following table sets forth items in our consolidated statement of operations in thousands and as a percentage of revenues for the periods indicated year ended december  as a as a as a of of of revenues revenues revenues revenues    cost of operations    selling  general and administrative    depreciation and amortization    loss on disposal of operations  income from operations    interest expense  net    other income expense  net  minority interests    income tax provision    cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  net of tax net income    years ended december  and revenues 
total revenues for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  revenues in the year ended december  from acquisitions closed in as well as the inclusion in of months of revenues from businesses acquired in totaled approximately million  or of the increase 
of the remaining increase in revenues  million was attributable to selected price increases and million was due to improved recyclable commodity prices offset by a decline in volumes in our existing business of million 
the volume reductions were primarily the result of the inclusion of one time projects in that were not repeated in and decreased volume at our transfer station in wichita  kansas 
revenue resulting from one time projects varies from year to year and generally is influenced by clean ups from weather and other natural phenomena and the volume of construction activity in our markets 
the decreased volume at our transfer station in wichita  kansas was a permanent reduction in revenues resulting from a loss of volumes from a competitor who had temporarily used our transfer station in the prior year 
cost of operations 
total cost of operations increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was almost entirely attributable to acquisitions closed in and the inclusion in of months of operating costs from businesses acquired in exclusive of the impact of acquisitions  total cost of operations increased million due to increases in vehicle maintenance and insurance  offset by lower disposal expense driven by higher levels of internalization and lower labor costs 
the decline in labor costs in the base business was primarily attributable to the incurrence in of million of non recurring costs resulting from an employee labor strike at our facilities in pierce county  washington 
total cost of operations as a percentage of revenues for the year ended december  decreased percentage points to from for the year ended december  the decrease as a percentage of revenues was primarily attributable to the incurrence in of million of non recurring costs resulting from an employee labor strike at our facilities in pierce county  washington and greater integration in of collection volumes into landfills we own or operate  partially offset by increased insurance costs 
sg a 
total sg a increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to additional personnel from acquisitions closed in and the inclusion in of months of sg a costs from businesses acquired in exclusive of the impact of acquisitions  sg a expenses were almost unchanged 
during  sg a expenses included million of nonrecurring employment related expenses associated with the termination of our search for a chief operating officer and the hiring of two new corporate officers  million of nonrecurring costs associated with the listing of our common stock on the new york stock exchange and million of expense associated with the relocation of our corporate office 
excluding these nonrecurring items  sg a expenses increased due to the inclusion in of costs from additional corporate  regional and district level personnel  increased legal and accounting expenses related to the new corporate governance requirements  and higher director and officer liability insurance costs 
in  we expect our sg a expenses to continue to increase as a result of the full year impact of acquisitions closed in and our expanded management infrastructure  the issuance to employees of million of restricted stock in that will be amortized to expense over its three year vesting term  and an expected increase in full year incentive compensation expense 
sg a as a percentage of revenues for the year ended december  increased percentage point to from for the year ended december  the increase in sg a as a percentage of revenues resulted from the addition of corporate  regional and district level personnel  increased legal and accounting expenses related to the new corporate governance requirements and higher director and officer liability insurance costs  partially offset by the incurrence in of million of nonrecurring employment related expenses associated with the termination of our search for a chief operating officer and the hiring of two new corporate officers  costs associated with listing our common stock on the new york stock exchange and our corporate office relocation 
sg a expenses in are expected to be flat as a percentage of revenues 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expenses for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  the increase resulted primarily from increased depreciation expense associated primarily with acquisitions closed in  the inclusion in of months of depreciation from businesses acquired in  additional intangible amortization resulting from acquisitions and increased depreciation in our base business 
the increased depreciation in our base business is primarily the result of capital expenditures running at levels significantly higher than depreciation 
depreciation and amortization as a percentage of revenues for the year ended december  increased percentage points to from for the year ended december  the increase in depreciation and amortization as a percentage of revenues resulted from the significant capital expenditures in as well as an increase in contract amortization associated with contracts acquired in operating income 
operating income for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to the growth in revenues  partially offset by higher operating costs  depreciation  amortization and sg a expenses 
operating income as a percentage of revenues for the year ended december  decreased percentage points to from for the year ended december  the decrease in operating income as a percentage of revenues was primarily attributable to an increase in depreciation and amortization offset partially by lower cost of operations 
interest expense 
interest expense for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to higher debt levels incurred to fund our acquisitions  partially offset by a lower average borrowing cost 
additionally  the expiration of our two high rate interest rate swap agreements in december resulted in savings in the month of december of approximately million 
at december   we had million of net floating rate balances  including floating rate debt under our credit facility  our floating rate convertible subordinated notes due  various floating rate notes payable to third parties and floating rate municipal bond obligations  offset by our debt effectively fixed under interest rate swap agreements scheduled to commence in february should interest rates rise  our interest costs on these borrowings would increase 
a one percent increase in interest rates would result in a million increase in interest expense 
other expense 
other expense decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the primary component of other expense for the year ended december  was net losses on the disposal of certain assets 
minority interests 
minority interests increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase was attributable to increased earnings by our majority owned subsidiaries 
provision for income taxes 
income taxes increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this increase was due to increased pre tax earnings  partially offset by a percentage point reduction in our effective tax rate due to the reversal of state tax liabilities associated with contingencies that expired in as well as an overall decline in our effective state tax rate due to changes in the apportionment of our earnings 
the effective income tax rate for the year ended december  was  which is above the federal statutory rate of primarily due to state and local taxes  partially offset by a reduction in our effective tax rate due to the reversal of tax liabilities associated with contingencies that were resolved in we analyze our tax reserves periodically but not less frequently than annually and adjustments are made as events occur to warrant adjustments to the reserve 
for example  if the statutory period for assessing tax on a given tax return or period lapses  the reserve associated with that period will be reduced 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  net of tax  was due to the adoption of sfas no 
on january  see note to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the impact of adopting sfas no 
net income 
net income increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to increased operating income in  partially offset by higher income tax expense and higher minority interests 
years ended december  and our adoption of sfas no 
resulted in the reclassification of accretion expense from interest expense to cost of operations 
the amounts reclassified were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the discussion below reflects this reclassification 
revenues 
total revenues for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  revenues in the year ended december  from acquisitions closed in as well as the inclusion in of months of revenues from businesses acquired in totaled approximately million  or of the increase 
for the remaining increase in revenues  million was attributable to selected price increases  million was due to improved recyclable commodity prices and million was the result of volume growth in our existing business 
cost of operations 
total cost of operations increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to acquisitions closed in  the inclusion in of months of operating costs from businesses acquired in  million of costs incurred resulting from an employee labor strike at our facilities in pierce county  washington  growth in our existing business and higher insurance costs  partially offset by greater integration of collection volumes into landfills we owned or operated 
total cost of operations as a percentage of revenues for the year ended december  increased percentage points to from for the year ended december  the increase as a percentage of revenues was primarily attributable to the mix of revenues associated with acquisitions closed in  which had gross margins below our company average  higher insurance costs  and costs resulting from a labor strike in pierce county  washington  partially offset by greater integration of collection volumes into landfills we owned or operated 
sg a 
total sg a increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to additional personnel from acquisitions closed in  the inclusion in of months of sg a costs from businesses acquired in  additional corporate  regional and district level overhead  million of employment related expenses associated with the termination of our search for a chief operating officer and the hiring of two new corporate officers  higher relocation expenses associated with new hires and transfers of existing employees  increased bad debt expense  increased legal expenses  higher insurance costs  stock compensation expense related to the issuance of restricted stock to district level personnel in  million expense associated with the relocation of our headquarters and early termination of our former corporate headquarters property lease and million of costs associated with the listing of our common stock on the new york stock exchange 
during the year ended december   we recognized million of expenses related to the termination of negotiations and due diligence for a large potential acquisition 
sg a as a percentage of revenues for the year ended december  increased percentage point to from for the year ended december  the increase in sg a as a percentage of revenues resulted from acquisitions closed in having sg a costs as a percentage of revenues above our company average  additional corporate  regional and district level overhead to accommodate our current and future growth  employment related expenses associated with the termination of our search for a chief operating officer and the hiring of two new corporate officers  higher employee relocation expenses related to new hires and transfers of existing employees  increased bad debt expense  increased legal expenses  stock compensation expense related to restricted stock issued to district level personnel in  the accrual of an expense associated with the relocation of our headquarters and early termination of our former corporate headquarters property lease and costs associated with the listing of our common stock on the new york stock exchange 
the increase in sg a as a percentage of revenues was partially offset by the recognition during of expenses related to the termination of negotiations and due diligence for a large potential acquisition 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expenses for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  the increase resulted primarily from increased depletion due to higher volumes of waste disposed at our landfills  depreciation and depletion associated with acquisitions closed in and the inclusion in of months of depreciation and depletion from businesses acquired in  and increased depreciation expense resulting from new equipment acquired to support our base operations  partially offset by decreased amortization expense from not amortizing goodwill during the year ended december   due to the application of the nonamortization provisions of sfas no 
total goodwill amortization expense recognized in the year ended december  was million 
no goodwill amortization expense was recognized in the year ended december  depreciation and amortization as a percentage of revenues for the year ended december  decreased percentage points to from for the year ended december  the decrease in depreciation and amortization as a percentage of revenues was the result of applying the nonamortization provisions of sfas no 
 partially offset by increased depletion due to higher volumes of waste disposed at our landfills and increased depreciation expense associated with new equipment acquired in goodwill amortization expense as a percentage of revenues for the year ended december  was loss on disposal of operations 
during the year ended december   we sold some of our utah operations that were deemed to no longer be of strategic importance 
we recognized a non cash pre tax loss of million from this sale 
operating income 
operating income for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to the growth in revenues  applying the nonamortization provisions of sfas no 
and the absence of the prior year loss associated with the disposal of some of our utah operations  partially offset by higher operating costs  depreciation  depletion and sg a expenses 
operating income as a percentage of revenues for the year ended december  increased percentage points to from for the year ended december  the increase in operating income as a percentage of revenues was attributable to applying the nonamortization provisions of sfas no 
and not incurring losses on the disposal of operations  partially offset by declines in gross margins  higher depreciation and depletion expenses and an increase in sg a expenses as a percentage of revenues 
interest expense 
interest expense for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to higher debt levels incurred to fund our acquisitions  partially offset by lower interest rates on our revolving credit facility and our replacing a portion of the borrowings under our revolving credit facility with lower interest subordinated debt obligations 
at december   we had million of floating rate borrowings under our credit facility  million of floating rate convertible subordinated notes due and million of other floating rate debt 
other expense 
other expense decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the primary component of other expense for the year ended december  was million of expenses resulting from cash payments for the early termination of an interest rate swap 
during the first quarter of  we determined that the debt  the specific cash flows of which an interest rate swap was designated as hedging  would be repaid prior to its due date from the net proceeds of our convertible subordinated debt offering  therefore  it was probable that the future variable interest payments under the related debt the hedged transactions would not occur 
the remaining components of other expense for and were net losses incurred on the disposal of certain assets 
minority interests 
minority interests increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase was attributable to increased earnings by our majority owned subsidiaries  as well as our owning majority interests in those entities  acquired in february  for the entire months ended december   compared to owning them for approximately eleven months in the year ended december  provision for income taxes 
income taxes increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this increase was due to increased pre tax earnings  partially offset by a percentage point reduction in our effective tax rate due to the elimination of non deductible goodwill 
the effective income tax rate for the year ended december  was  which is above the federal statutory rate of primarily due to state and local taxes 
net income 
net income increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to increased operating income in  and the absence of prior year losses associated with the disposal of some of our utah operations and the termination of an interest rate swap in  partially offset by increases in interest expense  higher income tax expense and higher minority interests 
liquidity and capital resources our business is capital intensive 
our capital requirements include acquisitions and fixed asset purchases 
we expect that we will also make capital expenditures for landfill cell construction  landfill development and landfill closure activities in the future 
we plan to meet our capital needs through various financing sources  including internally generated funds  debt and equity financings 
as of december   we had a working capital deficit of million  including cash and equivalents of million 
our working capital deficit decreased million from million at december  our strategy in managing our working capital is generally to apply the cash generated from our operations that remains after satisfying our working capital and capital expenditure requirements to reduce our indebtedness under our credit facility and to minimize our cash balances 
the decrease in our working capital deficit from the prior year resulted primarily from an increase in accounts receivable related to increased revenues  combined with a decrease in accrued liabilities due primarily to a decrease in the unrealized loss on our interest rate swaps of million  as well as a decrease in acquisition related accounts due to the payment of purchase price holdbacks 
in april  we sold million of convertible subordinated notes due april the notes in a rule a private placement 
the notes are unsecured  rank junior to existing and future senior indebtedness  as defined in the indenture governing the notes  and are convertible at any time at the option of the holder into common stock at a conversion price of per share 
we received proceeds of approximately million from our private placement of these notes and used these proceeds to repay certain outstanding indebtedness under our credit facility 
on march   we announced that on april   we intend to redeem the notes in full 
holders of the notes may elect to receive either cash or our common stock in exchange for their notes 
if holders of the notes elect to receive cash  the source of the redemption proceeds will be our revolving credit facility 
in april  we sold million of floating rate convertible subordinated notes due the notes 
the notes bear interest at the month libor rate plus basis points  payable quarterly 
the notes are unsecured and rank pari passu with the notes and junior to all existing and future senior indebtedness  as defined in the indenture governing the notes 
upon the incurrence of certain conditions  the notes are convertible into common stock at shares per  principal amount of notes  or per share 
our issuance of the notes did not result in any change in material covenants or in the committed amount under our credit facility 
we received proceeds of approximately million from our sale of the notes and used the proceeds to repay a portion of the outstanding indebtedness under our credit facility 
as of december   we had a million revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks for which fleet boston financial corporation acted as agent 
in october  we amended our credit facility to increase the maximum borrowings to million 
this new credit facility consists of a million senior secured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks for which fleet national bank acts as agent  and a million senior secured term loan 
in march  the senior secured term loan was refinanced to increase the total borrowing to million 
as of december   we had an aggregate of million outstanding under our credit facility  exclusive of outstanding stand by letters of credit of million 
as of december   million was outstanding under our credit facility as follows million was outstanding under our senior secured term loan and million was outstanding under our senior secured revolving credit facility  exclusive of outstanding stand by letters of credit of million 
the senior secured revolving credit facility requires monthly interest payments and matures in october the senior secured term loan requires annual principal payments equal to of the notional balance at the end of years one through six with all remaining outstanding amounts due october under the new credit facility  there is no maximum amount of stand by letters of credit that can be issued  however  the issuance of stand by letters of credit reduces the amount of total borrowings available 
the new credit facility requires us to pay a commitment fee ranging from to of the unused portion of the new credit facility 
we are able to increase the maximum borrowings under the new credit facility to million  although no existing lender will have any obligation to increase its commitment  provided that no event of default  as defined in the new credit facility  has occurred 
the borrowings under the new credit facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to  at our discretion  either the fleet national bank base rate plus applicable margin or the libor rate plus applicable margin 
the applicable margin under the revolving credit facility varies depending on our leverage ratio 
the applicable margin on the term loan is basis points in the case of loans based on the fleet national base rate and basis points in the case of loans based on the libor rate 
virtually all of our assets  including our interest in the equity securities of our subsidiaries  secure our obligations under the new credit facility 
the new credit facility places certain business  financial and operating limitations on us relating to  among other things  the incurrence of additional indebtedness  investments  acquisitions  asset sales  mergers  dividends  distributions and repurchases and redemption of capital stock 
the new credit facility permits redemption of the notes for cash 
the new credit facility also requires that specified financial ratios and balances be maintained 
as of december  and  we were in compliance with all applicable covenants in our then outstanding credit facility 
the credit facility also requires the lenders approval of acquisitions in certain circumstances 
we use the credit facility for acquisitions  capital expenditures  working capital  standby letters of credit and general corporate purposes 
the million increase in outstanding borrowings under our credit facility in was primarily due to funding new acquisitions and capital expenditures  partially offset by cash generated from operations and the proceeds from stock option exercises 
if we are unable to incur additional indebtedness under our credit facility or obtain additional capital through future debt or equity financings  our rate of growth through acquisitions may decline 
as of december   we had the following contractual obligations in thousands payments due by period less than recorded obligations total year to years to years over years long term debt      total recorded obligations      long term debt payments include million in principal payments due related to our senior secured revolving credit facility and million in principal payments due related to our senior secured term loan  both under our new credit facility 
as of december   our credit facility allowed us to borrow up to million 
amount of commitment expiration per period less than unrecorded obligations total year to years to years over years operating leases      unconditional purchase obligations    total unrecorded obligations      we are party to operating lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
these lease agreements and purchase obligations are established in the ordinary course of our business and are designed to provide us with access to facilities and products at competitive  market driven prices 
these arrangements have not materially affected our financial position  results of operations or liquidity during the year ended december  nor are they expected to have a material impact on our future financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
we are party to stand by letters of credit as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements and financial surety bonds as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
these stand by letters of credit and financial surety bonds are generally established to support our financial assurance needs and landfill operations 
these arrangements have not materially affected our financial position  results of operations or liquidity during the year ended december  nor are they expected to have a material impact on our future financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
the minority interest holders of a majority owned subsidiary of waste connections have a currently exercisable option the put option to require waste connections to complete the acquisition of this majority owned subsidiary by purchasing their minority ownership interests for fair market value 
the put option calculates the fair market value of the subsidiary based on its current operating income before depreciation and amortization  as defined in the put option agreement 
the put option does not have a stated termination date 
at december   the minority interest holders pro rata share of the subsidiary s fair market value is estimated to be worth between million and million 
because the put is required at fair market value  no amounts have been accrued relative to the put option 
for the year ended december   net cash provided by operations was approximately million 
of this  million was provided by working capital for the period 
the primary components of the reconciliation of net income to net cash provided by operations for the year ended december  consist of non cash expenses including million of depreciation and amortization  million of minority interest expense  million of debt issuance cost amortization  and the deferral of million of income tax expense resulting from temporary differences between the recognition of income and expenses for financial reporting and income tax purposes 
for the year ended december   net cash used in investing activities was million 
of this  million was used to fund the cash portion of acquisitions and to pay a portion of acquisition costs that were included as a component of accrued liabilities at december  cash used for capital expenditures was million  which was primarily for investments in fixed assets  consisting of trucks  containers  other equipment and landfill development 
other cash inflows from investing activities include million received from the disposal of assets 
other cash outflows from investing activities include million of restricted cash funding in for our landfill closure and post closure obligations and million paid to acquire a interest in a company that issues surety bonds for landfill closure and post closure obligations 
for the year ended december   net cash provided by financing activities was million  which included million of net borrowings under our various debt arrangements for the funding of capital expenditures and acquisitions and million of proceeds from stock option and warrant exercises  less million of cash distributions to minority interest holders and million of debt issuance costs  primarily related to our amended credit facility 
we made approximately million in capital expenditures during the year ended december  we expect to make capital expenditures of approximately million in in connection with our existing business 
we intend to fund our planned capital expenditures principally through existing cash  internally generated funds  and borrowings under our existing credit facility 
in addition  we may make substantial additional capital expenditures in acquiring solid waste collection and disposal businesses 
if we acquire additional landfill disposal facilities  we may also have to make significant expenditures to bring them into compliance with applicable regulatory requirements  obtain permits or expand our available disposal capacity 
we cannot currently determine the amount of these expenditures because they will depend on the number  nature  condition and permitted status of any acquired landfill disposal facilities 
we believe that our credit facility and the funds we expect to generate from operations will provide adequate cash to fund our working capital and other cash needs for the foreseeable future 
from time to time we evaluate our existing operations and their strategic importance to waste connections 
if we determine that a given operating unit does not have future strategic importance  we may sell or otherwise dispose of those operations 
although we believe our operations would not be impaired by such dispositions  we could incur losses on them 
new accounting pronouncements for a description of the new accounting standards that affect us  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
inflation to date  inflation has not materially affected our operations 
consistent with industry practice  many of our contracts allow us to pass through certain costs to our customers  including increases in landfill tipping fees and  in some cases  fuel costs 
therefore  we believe that we should be able to increase prices to offset many cost increases that result from inflation 
however  competitive pressures may require us to absorb at least part of these cost increases 
management s estimates associated with inflation have an impact on our accounting for landfill liabilities 
seasonality based on historic trends experienced by the businesses we have acquired  we expect our operating results to vary seasonally  with revenues typically lowest in the first quarter  higher in the second and third quarters and lower in the fourth quarter than in the second and third quarters 
we expect the fluctuation in our revenues between our highest and lowest quarters to be approximately to 
this seasonality reflects the lower volume of solid waste generated during the late fall  winter and early spring months because of decreased construction and demolition activities during the winter months in the us in addition  some of our operating costs may be higher in the winter months 
adverse winter weather conditions slow waste collection activities  resulting in higher labor and operational costs 
greater precipitation in the winter increases the weight of collected waste  resulting in higher disposal costs  which are calculated on a per ton basis 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk in the normal course of business  we are exposed to market risk  including changes in interest rates and certain commodity prices 
we use hedge agreements to manage a portion of our risks related to interest rates 
while we are exposed to credit risk in the event of non performance by counterparties to our hedge agreements  in all cases such counterparties are highly rated financial institutions and we do not anticipate non performance 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
we monitor our hedge positions by regularly evaluating the positions at market and by performing sensitivity analyses 
in december  the company restructured two existing interest rate swap agreements  extending their maturity through december and removing the embedded option features of the agreements 
as of december   the fleet boston swap had a notional amount of million at a fixed rate of plus applicable margin and the union bank of california swap had a notional amount of million at a fixed rate of plus applicable margin 
in march  million of the notional amount under the union bank of california swap was terminated because the company used the proceeds from its convertible subordinated notes offering to repay million of the libor note the cash flows of which this swap was designated to hedge 
the company made a cash payment of million to terminate the swap prior to its due date 
in may  we entered into two forward starting interest rate swap agreements 
each interest rate swap agreement has a notional amount of million and effectively fixes the interest rate on the notional amount at interest rates ranging from to  plus applicable margin 
the effective date of the swap agreements is february and each swap agreement expires in february these interest rate swap agreements are effective as cash flow hedges for a portion of our variable rate debt and we apply hedge accounting pursuant to sfas no 
to account for these instruments 
the notional amounts and all other significant terms of the swap agreements are matched to the provisions and terms of the variable rate debt being hedged 
we have performed sensitivity analyses to determine how market rate changes will affect the fair value of our market risk sensitive hedge positions and all other debt 
such an analysis is inherently limited in that it reflects a singular  hypothetical set of assumptions 
actual market movements may vary significantly from our assumptions 
fair value sensitivity is not necessarily indicative of the ultimate cash flow or earnings effect we would recognize from the assumed market rate movements 
we are exposed to cash flow risk due to changes in interest rates with respect to the net floating rate balances owed at december  and of million and million  respectively  including floating rate debt under our credit facility  our notes  various floating rate notes payable to third parties and floating rate municipal bond obligations  offset by our debt effectively fixed under interest rate swap agreements 
a one percent increase in interest rates on our variable rate debt as of december  and would decrease our annual pre tax income by approximately million in both years 
all of our remaining debt instruments are at fixed rates  or effectively fixed under the interest rate swap agreements described above  therefore  changes in market interest rates under these instruments would not significantly impact our cash flows or results of operations 
we market a variety of recyclable materials  including cardboard  office paper  plastic containers  glass bottles and ferrous and aluminum metals 
we own and operate recycling processing operations and sell other collected recyclable materials to third parties for processing before resale 
we often share the profits from our resale of recycled materials with other parties to our recycling contracts 
for example  certain of our municipal recycling contracts in washington  negotiated before we acquired those businesses  specify benchmark resale prices for recycled commodities 
if the prices we actually receive for the processed recycled commodities collected under the contract exceed the prices specified in the contract  we share the excess with the municipality  after recovering any previous shortfalls resulting from actual market prices falling below the prices specified in the contract 
to reduce our exposure to commodity price risk with respect to recycled materials  we have adopted a pricing strategy of charging collection and processing fees for recycling volume collected from third parties 
although there can be no assurance of market recoveries  in the event of a decline  because of the provisions within certain of our contracts that pass commodity risk along to the customers  we believe  given historical trends and fluctuations in the recycling commodities market  that a decrease in average recycled commodity prices from the prices that were in effect at december  and would not materially affect our cash flows or pre tax income
