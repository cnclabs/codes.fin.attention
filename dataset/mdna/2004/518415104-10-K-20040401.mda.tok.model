lattice semiconductor corporation designs  develops and markets high performance programmable logic devices  or plds  and related software 
programmable logic devices are widely used semiconductor components that can be configured by the end customer as specific logic circuits  and enable the end customer to shorten design cycle times and reduce development costs 
our end customers are primarily original equipment manufacturers in the communications  computing  industrial  automotive  medical  consumer and military end markets 
restatement and change in accounting estimate during we restated our deferred income and accrued expense balance sheet accounts  and revenue and cost of products sold accounts in the consolidated statement of operations for the june and september quarters of and our deferred income  revenue and cost of products sold accounts for the march quarter of to correct accounting errors and to reflect a change in accounting estimate related to deferred income 
for the year  the aforementioned restatement related to accrued expenses and the changes in accounting estimate reduced revenue by approximately million  reduced cost of products sold by approximately million  reduced gross margin by approximately million and increased deferred income by approximately million 
the related circumstances are described in more detail in note to the table of unaudited quarterly data in item of this annual report on form k 
overview of revenue for our business in declined to approximately million as compared to approximately million in primarily due to continued weakness in the sales of our cpld and spld products 
revenue from our fpga products  on the other hand  grew from approximately million in to million in however  we saw an improvement in business conditions in the fourth quarter of which has continued during the first quarter of attributable to general strengthening in the pld market and improvement in the communications end market 
future revenue growth is dependent  among other things  upon market acceptance of our new fpga products 
our gross margin declined in to from in due to factors including distributor sales allowances  and to a lesser extent  lower production yields and average selling prices on our new products 
research and development expenses increased to approximately million of revenue in compared to approximately million in of revenue 
the majority of research and development spending is related to the continued development of next generation fpga products 
we expect research and development spending to continue at present levels during as we introduce our next generation fpga products 
selling  general and administrative expenses were approximately million in of revenue as compared to approximately million in of revenue primarily due to marketing expenses related to new products and increased professional fees including those related to the restatement of the first  second and third quarter financial statements 
to the extent our revenues continue to grow  we expect that there will be a less than proportionate increase in our selling  general and administrative expenses 
amortization of intangible assets of approximately million in will decline by approximately million per quarter beginning with the september quarter of as amortization of intangible assets acquired in the vantis acquisition will be completed 
interest and other income expense of approximately million in is primarily attributable to the issuance of zero coupon convertible subordinated notes due july  and retirement of our convertible subordinated notes due during the second and third quarter of  respectively 
interest and other income expense of million in the fourth quarter of represents interest rate driven investment income partially offset by amortization of issuance costs of the zero coupon convertible subordinated notes due july  during the first quarter of  we sold a portion of our umc marketable securities holdings resulting in a gain of approximately million 
to the extent market conditions allow  we may make similar sales in future quarters 
we are not currently paying federal or state income taxes and do not expect to pay or accrue such taxes in results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of revenue represented by selected items reflected in our consolidated statement of operations years ended december  revenue costs and expenses cost of products sold research and development selling  general and administrative in process research and development amortization of intangible assets total costs and expenses loss from operations other expense income  net loss before benefit provision for income taxes benefit provision for income taxes net loss acquisitions 
on august   we completed the stock for stock acquisition of cerdelinx technologies  inc cerdelinx for million shares valued at per share 
this transaction was accounted for as an asset purchase  and accordingly  the results of operations for cerdelinx and estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are included in our consolidated financial statements beginning august  in estimating the fair value of the assets acquired  management considered various factors  including an appraisal 
in process research and development ipr d costs were appraised at million and charged to operations on the acquisition date 
remaining intangible asset costs are being amortized to operations over a period averaging five years 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
on january   we completed the acquisition of the field programmable gate array fpga business agere fpga of agere systems inc agere for million in cash 
this transaction was accounted for as a purchase  and accordingly  the results of operations for agere fpga and estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are included in our consolidated financial statements beginning january  in estimating the fair value of the assets acquired  management considered various factors  including an appraisal 
ipr d costs were appraised at million and charged to operations on the acquisition date 
remaining intangible asset costs are being amortized to operations over years 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
revenue 
revenue was million in  a decrease of nine percent from revenue was million in  a decrease of from revenue of million 
the composition of our revenue by product family for the years presented was as follows years ended december  fpga cpld spld prior to the acquisition of agere fpga  we had no revenue from fpga products 
during  our revenue was adversely affected by the business downturn experienced by the semiconductor and pld markets that began in  offset in part by a general business recovery experienced late in the year 
our revenue decrease in as compared to was a result of this downturn and the resultant decrease in demand for our products 
revenue declined across all geographies except asia  and demand across most end markets remained weak 
our sales by geographic region were as follows in thousands years ended december  united states    export sales europe    japan    asia pacific other than japan    other    revenue from export sales as a percentage of total revenue was approximately for  for and for we expect export sales to continue to represent a significant portion of revenue 
during  total units sold and our overall average selling prices both decreased by approximately nine percent when compared to during  total units sold decreased by and our overall average selling price decreased by three percent when compared to both units sold and average selling price were adversely impacted by the continued downturn in the semiconductor and pld markets 
although selling prices of mature products generally decline over time  this decline is at times offset by higher selling prices of new products 
our ability to maintain or increase the level of our average selling price is dependent on the continued development  introduction and market acceptance of new products 
see factors affecting future results 
gross margin 
our gross margin percentage was for  for  and for the decrease in gross margin percentage in is primarily attributable to provision for an allowance for price protection and sales returns for distributors in the september quarter 
to a lesser extent  this decrease in gross margin also reflects the increased proportion of fixed manufacturing costs as a result of lower revenue levels 
the decrease in gross margin percentage in as compared to was primarily due to the increased proportion of fixed manufacturing costs due to a decline in production volume 
reductions in our overall manufacturing costs and improvements in our product mix generally offset an increased proportion of fixed manufacturing costs in product mix in was favorably affected by a higher ratio of previously deferred income compared to income from direct customer sales 
reductions in manufacturing costs resulted primarily from on going yield improvements  migration of products to more advanced technologies and smaller die sizes 
research and development 
research and development expense was million for compared to million for and million in research and development expenses consist primarily of labor  masks  prototype wafers  third party design automation software  assembly tooling and qualification expenses 
the increase in when compared to was primarily due to the continued development of new products 
the increase in when compared to was primarily due to increased headcount and related spending due to our acquisition of agere fpga see note to our consolidated financial statements 
we believe that a continued commitment to research and development is essential in order to maintain product leadership and provide innovative new product offerings  and therefore we expect to continue to make significant future investments in research and development 
as we continue to move to more advanced process technologies such as nm  nm and beyond  mask costs are becoming  and we believe will continue to become  significantly more expensive and will therefore increasingly represent a greater proportion of total research and development expenses 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense was million in  million in  and million in the increase in when compared to was primarily due to increased marketing expense related to new products and increased professional fees including those related to the restatement of the first  second and third quarter financial statements 
the decrease in when compared to was primarily due to reduced revenue and associated reductions in variable costs and reductions in discretionary spending 
in process research and development 
ipr d consists of those products obtained through acquisition that are not yet proven to be technologically feasible but have been developed to a point where there is value associated with them in relation to potential future revenue 
because technological feasibility was not yet proven and no alternative future uses are believed to exist for the in process technologies  the assigned value was expensed immediately upon the closing date of the acquisitions 
ipr d recorded in resulted from the completion of the agere fpga and cerdelinx acquisitions described below cerdelinx the fair value underlying the million assigned to acquired ipr d from the cerdelinx acquisition recognized in the third quarter of was determined by identifying research projects in areas for which technological feasibility had not been established and there were no alternative future uses 
the acquired ipr d consists of low power cmos transceivers and backplane interfaces with embedded high speed serdes i o 
these products were approximately complete and were estimated to be completed in at an estimated cost of approximately million 
this project is now estimated to be complete in the first half of there has been no material change in the estimated cost of this project 
the fair value was determined by an income approach where fair value is the present value of projected free cash flows that will be generated by the products incorporating the acquired technologies under development  assuming they are successfully completed 
the estimated net free cash flows generated by the products over six year periods were discounted at rates ranging from to in relation to the stage of completion and the technical risks associated with achieving technological feasibility 
the net cash flows for such projects were based on management s estimates of revenue  expenses and asset requirements 
all of these projects have completion risks related to silicon functionality  architecture performance  process technology availability  packaging technology  continued availability of key technical personnel and product reliability 
to the extent that estimated completion dates are not met  the risk of competitive product introduction is greater and revenue opportunity may be permanently lost 
agere fpga the fair value underlying the million assigned to acquired ipr d in the agere fpga acquisition was determined by identifying research projects in areas for which technological feasibility had not been established and there was no alternative future use 
projects in the ipr d category are the orca fpga family  the next generation fpga family and the fpsc field programmable system chips 
the following is a brief description of these projects 
the orca fpga family project  increasing speed and density and enhancing yields  was approximately complete and estimated to be completed by at an estimated cost of million 
this project was completed during with no material change in cost 
the next generation fpga family project  increasing speed and density while reducing die size  was approximately complete and estimated to be completed by at an estimated cost of million 
there has been no material change in the schedule or estimated cost of this project 
the future development of fpsc field programmable system chips field programmable system chips which combine embedded pre defined logic circuits with an fpga platform was approximately to complete  and estimated to be completed by at an estimated cost of million 
there has been no material change in the schedule or estimated cost of this project 
the ipr d value of million was determined by an income approach where fair value is the present value of projected free cash flows that will be generated by the products incorporating the acquired technologies under development  assuming they are successfully completed 
the estimated net free cash flows generated by the products over year periods were discounted at rates ranging from to in relation to the stage of completion and the technical risks associated with achieving technological feasibility 
the net cash flows for such projects were based on management s estimates of revenue  expenses and asset requirements 
any delays or failures in the completion of these projects could impact our expected return on investment and future results 
in addition  our financial condition would be adversely affected if the value of other intangible assets acquired became impaired 
all of these projects have completion risks related to silicon functionality  architecture performance  process technology availability  packaging technology  continued availability of key technical personnel  product reliability and availability of software support 
to the extent that estimated completion dates are not met  the risk of competitors product introductions is greater and revenue opportunity may be permanently lost 
amortization of intangible assets 
amortization of intangible assets is related to our acquisitions  discussed above  our vantis acquisition and our acquisition of integrated intellectual property  inc ip 
amortization expense was million in  million in  and million in the increase in amortization for when compared with was due to a full year of amortization of intangible assets related to our acquisitions  and approximately million incremental amortization of deferred stock compensation in association with the accelerated write off of accrued deferred compensation recorded in conjunction with certain assumed in the money stock options as part of a stock option exchange program completed during the first quarter of see note to our consolidated financial statements 
the decrease in amortization for compared to was due to the cessation of amortizing goodwill in see note to our consolidated financial statements which more than offset the increased amortization of intangible assets related to our acquisitions of agere fpga and cerdelinx 
loss gain on foundry investments 
the loss on foundry investments recorded in the third quarter of represents impairment loss on our umc common shares 
in the september quarter  the carrying value of the umc shares was reduced as we recorded a million loss representing a decline in the market value of our umc shares 
in each quarter that the market value of the umc investment is below carrying value  we evaluate whether the investment is other than temporarily impaired 
we recorded the unrealized loss on our umc investment in the september  consolidated statement of operations 
at that time  we believed the investment was other than temporarily impaired for the following reasons it was becoming increasingly likely that the stock price would not recover based on the increasing size of the unrealized loss  the extended time period during which the stock price had continued to decline without a trend reversal  and the dampening volatility  which indicated to us that the stock price was becoming more stable  umc s financial performance had weakened relative to earlier quarters  the opinion of many industry observers and analysts regarding the semiconductor downturn had become significantly more negative  the events of september  further exacerbated market conditions  we had previously believed that umc would initiate an adr conversion program that would enable us to sell our shares at a premium on the new york stock exchange  but such a program was never initiated  and although we still had the intent and ability to hold the shares for an indefinite period  we concluded this fact did not overcome the negative factors associated with the shares 
interest income 
interest income was million in  million in  and million in the decrease in when compared to was due to lower interest rates on invested balances 
the decrease in when compared to was due to lower invested balances as a result of our acquisition of agere fpga see note to our consolidated financial statements and lower interest rates on invested balances 
interest expense 
interest expense was approximately million in  million in and million in substantially all interest expense resulted from the debt issued to partially fund our vantis acquisition 
the decrease in when compared to was due to the redemption of our remaining convertible subordinated notes in july the decrease in when compared to is due to the extinguishment of approximately million of our convertible subordinated notes during the year see note to our consolidated financial statements 
other income 
other income  net  was million in  million in and million in for  other income consists of gains recorded on the partial extinguishment of our convertible subordinated notes  substantially offset by the million call premium associated with the redemption of our convertible subordinated notes see note to our consolidated financial statements 
for  the amount recorded consists primarily of a million gain in conjunction with the extinguishment of a portion of our convertible subordinated notes see note to our consolidated financial statements  and a million gain in conjunction with the sale of a portion of our umc shares see note to our consolidated financial statements 
benefit provision for income taxes 
the tax benefit in is primarily a result of releasing certain tax reserves million as the related statute of limitations expired and a refund of federal income taxes million 
the provision for income taxes for of million is primarily the result of a million charge to income tax expense recorded in the fourth quarter of  representing a full valuation allowance for our recorded deferred tax assets see note to our consolidated financial statements 
the tax benefit in is the result of the pretax loss reported in the period and the tax rate in is lower than the combined federal and statutory rates primarily because of tax exempt investment income and tax credits 
critical accounting policies and estimates critical accounting policies are those that are both most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
a description of our critical accounting policies follows 
use of estimates 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  such as accounts receivable  inventory and deferred income taxes and liabilities  such as accrued liabilities  income taxes and deferred income  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the fiscal periods presented 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition 
revenue from direct customers is recognized upon shipment provided that persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists  the price is fixed and determinable  title has transferred  collection of resulting receivables is probable  there are no customer acceptance requirements and no remaining significant obligations 
certain of our sales are made to distributors under agreements providing price protection and right of return on unsold merchandise 
revenue and costs relating to such distributor sales are deferred until the product is sold by the distributor and related revenue and costs are then reflected in income 
our method of revenue recognition for deferred distributor sales is based on certain assumptions including our average collection experience compared to resale reported by the distributors 
to the extent actual results differ from these assumptions  revenue will change accordingly 
deferred income 
in determining the balance in the deferred income account  we make estimates of salable and returnable inventory at certain distributors and we make estimates similar to those used to value inventory on hand to value inventory at these distributors 
to the extent actual results differ from these estimates  the balances of reported deferred income  revenue and cost of products sold will change accordingly 
inventory 
we value inventory at the lower of cost or market on a quarterly basis 
in addition  we write down unproven  excess and obsolete inventories to net realizable value 
to value our inventory  we make a number of estimates and assumptions including future price declines and forecasted demand for our products 
to the extent actual results differ from these estimates and assumptions  the balances of reported inventory and cost of products sold will change accordingly 
long lived assets 
we account for our long lived assets  primarily property and equipment and amortizable intangible assets  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the disposal of long lived assets  which requires us to review the impairment of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
impairment is measured by comparing the estimated undiscounted cash flows to the carrying amount 
a loss is recorded if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows 
intangible assets are generally being amortized over five years  and fifteen years for income tax purposes  on a straight line basis 
accounting for income taxes 
to report income tax expense related to operating results  we record current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities in our balance sheet 
in determining the value of our deferred tax assets  we make estimates of future taxable income 
as of december  and  we have recorded full valuation allowances for all of our deferred tax assets due to uncertainties regarding their realization 
in determining the value of income tax liabilities  we make estimates of the results of future examinations of our income tax returns by taxing authorities 
to the extent actual results differ from these estimates  our income tax provision will be affected accordingly 
new accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued financial standards accounting board interpretation fin no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements 
fin establishes accounting guidance for consolidation of a variable interest entity 
in a variable interest entity the equity investors do not have a controlling interest or their equity interest is insufficient to finance the entity s activities without receiving additional subordinated financial support from the other parties 
we do not currently have any business relationship with a variable interest entity  so the adoption of fin had no impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in april  the fasb issued sfas  amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities under sfas sfas is effective for contracts entered into or modified after june  the adoption of sfas did not have a material effect on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in may  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
this pronouncement establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures in its statement of financial position certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability or an asset in certain circumstances because that financial instrument embodies an obligation of the issuer 
sfas is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective for interim periods beginning after june  on november   fasb issued fasb staff position no 
fas fsp  effective date  disclosures  and transition for mandatorily redeemable financial instruments of certain nonpublic entities and certain mandatorily redeemable noncontrolling interests under fasb statement no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
fsp deferred certain aspects of sfas the adoption of sfas and fsp did not have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
on december   the staff of the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition  which supersedes sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab s primary purpose is to rescind accounting guidance contained in sab related to multiple element revenue arrangements  superseded as a result of the issuance of eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
additionally  sab rescinds the sec s revenue recognition in financial statements frequently asked questions and answers the faq issued with sab that had been codified in sec topic  revenue recognition 
selected portions of the faq have been incorporated into sab while the wording of sab has changed to reflect the issuance of eitf  the revenue recognition principles of sab remain largely unchanged by the issuance of sab the adoption of sab did not materially affect our revenue recognition policies  nor our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   our principal source of liquidity was million of cash and short term investments  which was approximately flat with the balance of million at december  working capital increased to million at december  from million at december  this increase was primarily due to cash generated from operations 
during we generated approximately million of cash and cash equivalents from our operations compared with million during this cash generation was primarily from refunds of federal income taxes previously paid due to net losses in and inventories decreased by million  or  in as compared to the balance of the prior year primarily due to reduced starts and receipts of wafers in response to lower revenue levels 
prepaid expenses and other current assets decreased by approximately million  or  in as compared to the balance of the prior year 
this decrease is due primarily to a decrease in refundable income taxes  offsetting an approximate million increase in the amount of prepaid wafers expected to be used in the next twelve months see note to our consolidated financial statements 
equity securities available for sale increased by million  or  in as compared to the balance in the prior year 
these securities represent the portion of our investment in umc that we expect to sell during see notes and to our consolidated financial statements 
foundry investments  advances and other assets decreased by approximately million  or  in as compared to the balance of the prior year 
this was primarily due to the million of our umc investment reclassified to equity securities available for sale as described above and the million reclassified to prepaid expenses and other current assets related to prepaid wafers described above  partially offset by a million gain recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss income related to changes in the market value of our umc shares 
property and equipment  less accumulated depreciation  decreased by million  or  in as compared to the balance in the prior year due to lower expenditures for capital equipment 
net intangible assets decreased by million  or  in as compared to the balance of the prior year which is attributable to amortization during on june   we issued million in zero coupon convertible subordinated notes due july  no interest will accrue or be payable related to these notes 
holders of these notes may convert the notes into shares of our common stock at any time before the close of business on the date of their maturity  unless the notes have been previously redeemed or repurchased  if the price of our common stock issuable upon conversion of a note reaches a specified threshold  the notes are called for redemption  specified corporate transactions occur or the trading price of the notes falls below certain thresholds 
the conversion price is approximately per share  subject to adjustment in certain circumstances 
on or after july   we have the option to redeem all or a portion of the notes that have not been previously repurchased or converted at of the principal amount of the notes 
on july   holders have the option to require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes in cash at of the principal amount of the notes 
holders also have the right  subject to certain conditions  to require us to repurchase the notes in the event of a fundamental change as defined in the indenture governing the notes at of the principal amount of the notes 
the notes are subordinated in right of payment to all of our senior indebtedness  and are structurally subordinated as to the revenues and assets of our subsidiaries to all debt and other liabilities of our subsidiaries 
at december   we had no senior indebtedness and our subsidiaries had approximately million of debt and other liabilities outstanding 
issuance costs relative to these convertible notes are included in foundry investments  advances and other assets and aggregated approximately million and are being amortized to expense over the lives of the notes 
accumulated amortization of these issuance costs was approximately million as of december  the estimated fair value of these convertible notes  based on quoted market prices  was approximately million at december  in october  our board of directors authorized management to repurchase up to million of our zero coupon convertible subordinated notes due july  during the third quarter of  we extinguished approximately million of these notes for approximately million in cash and recognized a gain of approximately million 
in connection with this transaction  we also wrote off approximately million of unamortized issuance costs 
on july   we redeemed for cash all of our outstanding convertible subordinated notes due in  originally issued in october  plus accrued interest 
total cash paid at redemption approximated million  including par value of million  accrued interest of approximately million and a call premium of of the outstanding notes  or approximately million 
this call premium  plus unamortized issuance costs of approximately million as of the redemption date  was recorded as other expense in the quarter ended september  during  we extinguished approximately million face value of our convertible subordinated notes due in for approximately million in cash  including accrued interest 
we recognized a gain of approximately million in connection with these transactions 
capital expenditures were approximately million  million and million for  and  respectively 
we expect to spend approximately million to million on capital expenditures for the fiscal year ending december  the following table summarizes our significant contractual cash obligations at december  in thousands year operating leases inventory and related purchase obligations zero coupon convertible subordinated notes due july  later years  certain of our facilities and equipment are leased under operating leases  which expire at various times through rental expense under the operating leases was approximately million  million and million for  and  respectively 
we depend entirely upon subcontractors to manufacture our silicon wafers 
other subcontractors provide substantially all our assembly and test services 
due to lengthy subcontractor lead times  we must order these materials and services well in advance  and we are obligated to pay for these materials and services once they are completed 
we expect to receive and pay for these materials within the four to six months subsequent to december  included in the above operating lease amounts are certain properties which are currently subleased 
a portion of this sublease income is payable to the property owner 
future minimum sublease receipts  based on agreements in place at december   net of such payments are as follows in thousands year as of december   we owned million shares of umc of which million were restricted from sale for more than one year by the terms of our agreements with umc 
during  we sold approximately million of our umc shares for approximately million in cash  resulting in a gain of million 
during the first quarter of  we sold million of our umc shares for approximately million in cash  resulting in a gain of approximately million 
see notes and to our consolidated financial statements 
in december  our board of directors authorized management to repurchase up to five million shares of our common stock 
as of december   we had repurchased  shares  in at an aggregate cost of approximately million million in 
there were no repurchases of common stock in or in march and as subsequently amended in january  we entered into an advance payment production agreement with seiko epson and epson electronics america  inc eea under which we agreed to advance up to approximately million  payable upon completion of specific milestones  to seiko epson to finance construction of an eight inch sub micron semiconductor wafer manufacturing facility 
under the terms of the agreement  the advance is to be repaid with semiconductor wafers over a multi year period 
no interest income is recorded 
the agreement calls for wafers to be supplied by seiko epson through eea pursuant to purchase agreements with eea 
payments of approximately million have been made under this agreement 
cumulatively  approximately million of these payments have been repaid to us in the form of semiconductor wafers 
approximately million of the outstanding advances are expected to be repaid with semiconductor wafers during fiscal year and are thus reflected as part of prepaid expenses and other current assets in our consolidated balance sheet 
we do not anticipate making additional payments under this agreement 
in an effort to secure a long term  stable advanced technology wafer supply  we plan to invest between million and million in fujitsu s planned new mm wafer fab 
presently  we contemplate making this investment in stages before the end of and structuring the investment as an advance payment for production wafers and for access to future process technologies 
the detailed terms of the investment are not yet finalized 
we believe that our existing liquid resources and expected cash generated from operations combined with our ability to borrow additional funds will be adequate to meet our operating and capital requirements and obligations for the next months 
we may in the future seek new or additional sources of funding 
in addition  in order to secure additional wafer supply  we may from time to time consider various financial arrangements including joint ventures  equity investments  advance purchase payments  loans  or similar arrangements with independent wafer manufacturers in exchange for committed wafer capacity 
to the extent that we pursue any such additional financing arrangements  additional debt or equity financing may be required 
there can be no assurance that such additional financing will be available when needed or  if available  will be on favorable terms 
any future equity financing will decrease existing stockholders equity percentage ownership and may  depending on the price at which the equity is sold  result in dilution 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any financial partnerships with unconsolidated entities  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which are often established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
accordingly  we are not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had such relationships 
factors affecting future results a downturn in the communications equipment and computing end markets has caused a reduction in demand for our products and limited our ability to maintain or increase revenue levels and operating results 
a significant portion of our revenue is derived from customers in the communications equipment and computing end markets 
due to a deterioration in overall economic conditions and a significant reduction in information technology capital spending  the communications and computing end markets have experienced a significant and prolonged downturn 
while economic conditions in general  and the communications and computer end markets in particular  have recently shown signs of improvement  the improved conditions may not continue or lead to improved demand for our products 
whenever adverse economic or end market similar conditions exist  there is likely to be an adverse effect on our operating results 
we may be unsuccessful in defining  developing or selling new products required to maintain or expand our business 
as a semiconductor company  we operate in a dynamic environment marked by rapid product obsolescence 
our future success depends on our ability to introduce new or improved silicon and software products that meet customer needs while achieving acceptable margins 
if we fail to introduce these new products in a timely manner or these products fail to achieve market acceptance  our operating results would be harmed 
the introduction of new silicon and software products in a dynamic market environment presents significant business challenges 
product development commitments and expenditures must be made well in advance of product sales 
the market reception of new products depends on accurate projections of long term customer demand  which by their nature are uncertain 
our future revenue growth is dependent on market acceptance of our new silicon and software product families and the continued market acceptance of our current products 
the success of these products is dependent on a variety of specific technical factors including successful product definition  timely and efficient completion of product design  timely and efficient implementation of wafer manufacturing and assembly processes  product performance  product cost  and the quality and reliability of the product 
if  due to these or other factors  our new silicon and software products do not achieve market acceptance  our operating results would be harmed 
in march  we announced that fujitsu limited has agreed to manufacture our next generation fpga products on its nanometer and nanometer cmos process technologies  as well as on a nanometer technology with embedded flash memory that we are jointly developing with fujitsu 
the success of our future product launches is dependent on our ability to successfully partner with fujitsu  which has not previously manufactured any of our products 
if for any reason we are unsuccessful in our efforts to partner with fujitsu in connection with these future product launches  our future revenue growth will be materially adversely affected 
the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry may limit our ability to maintain or increase revenue levels and operating results during current or future industry downturns 
the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical  to a greater extent than other less technology driven industries 
our financial performance has periodically been negatively affected by downturns in the semiconductor industry 
factors that contribute to these industry downturns include the cyclical nature of the demand for the products of semiconductor customers  general reductions in inventory levels by customers  excess production capacity  general decline in end user demand  and accelerated declines in average selling prices 
beginning in  the semiconductor industry experienced a downturn of extreme severity and duration 
while semiconductor industry conditions recently have improved  the improvement may not be significant or sustainable 
increased demand for semiconductor industry products may not proportionately increase demand for programmable logic market segment products in general  or our products in particular 
even if demand for our products increases  average sales prices for our products may not increase  and could decline 
whenever adverse semiconductor industry conditions or other similar conditions exist  there is likely to be an adverse effect on our operating results 
our products may not be competitive if we are unsuccessful in migrating our manufacturing processes to more advanced technologies or alternative fabrication facilities 
to develop new products and maintain the competitiveness of existing products  we need to migrate to more advanced wafer manufacturing processes that use larger wafer sizes and smaller device geometries 
we also may need to use additional foundries 
because we depend upon foundries to provide their facilities and support for our process technology development  we may experience delays in the availability of advanced wafer manufacturing process technologies at existing or new wafer fabrication facilities 
as a result  volume production of our advanced process technologies at the fabs of seiko epson  umc  chartered semiconductor  fujitsu or future foundries may not be achieved 
this could harm our operating results 
we face risks related to our recent accounting restatement 
on january   we announced that we had discovered possible accounting inaccuracies in previously reported quarterly financial statements 
an internal investigation was conducted by the audit committee of our board of directors to determine the scope and magnitude of these inaccuracies 
on march   we announced that the audit committee had completed its internal accounting investigation and  as a result  we were required to restate our financial statements for the first  second and third quarters of to correct inappropriate accounting entries and a failure to record a change in accounting estimate related to deferred income 
the restatement of these financial statements may lead to litigation claims and or regulatory proceedings against us 
the defense of any such claims or proceedings may cause the diversion of management s attention and resources  and we may be required to pay damages if any such claims or proceedings are not resolved in our favor 
any litigation or regulatory proceeding  even if resolved in our favor  could cause us to incur significant legal and other expenses 
moreover  we may be the subject of negative publicity focusing on the financial statement inaccuracies and resulting restatement 
the occurrence of any of the foregoing could harm our business and reputation and cause the price of our common stock to decline 
if we are unable to effectively and efficiently implement our plan to remediate a material weakness that has been identified in our internal controls and procedures  there could be a material adverse effect on our operations or financial results 
we received notice from our independent auditor that  in connection with the year end audit  the auditor has identified a material weakness in our internal controls and procedures relating to separation of duties and establishment of standards for review of journal entries and related file documentation 
we have implemented and are continuing to implement various initiatives intended to materially improve our internal controls and procedures to address this weakness 
these initiatives address our control environment  organization and staffing  policies  procedures and documentation  and information systems 
the implementation of these initiatives is one of our highest priorities 
our board of directors  in coordination with our audit committee  will continually assess the progress and sufficiency of these initiatives and make adjustments as necessary 
however  no assurance can be given that we will be able to successfully implement our revised internal controls and procedures or that our revised controls and procedures will be effective in remedying all of the identified deficiencies in our internal controls and procedures 
in addition  we may be required to hire additional employees  and may experience higher than anticipated capital expenditures and operating expenses  during the implementation of these changes and thereafter 
if we are unable to implement these changes effectively or efficiently  there could be a material adverse effect on our operations or financial results 
moreover  we could be subject to additional regulatory oversight and our business and reputation could be harmed 
in addition  we may in the future experience accounting estimate changes related to our deferred income account  inventory account  income tax liability  accounts receivable collectibility  or realization of goodwill and intangible assets  any of which could adversely affect our financial results 
our future quarterly operating results may fluctuate and therefore may fail to meet expectations 
our quarterly operating results have fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate 
consequently  our operating results may fail to meet the expectations of analysts and investors 
as a result of industry conditions and the following specific factors  our quarterly operating results are more likely to fluctuate and are more difficult to predict than a typical non technology company of our size and maturity general economic conditions in the countries where we sell our products  conditions within the end markets into which we sell our products  the cyclical nature of demand for our customers products  excessive inventory accumulation by our end customers  the timing of our and our competitors new product introductions  product obsolescence  the scheduling  rescheduling and cancellation of large orders by our customers  our ability to develop new process technologies and achieve volume production at the fabs of seiko epson  umc  chartered semiconductor  fujitsu or at other foundries  changes in manufacturing yields  adverse movements in exchange rates  interest rates or tax rates  and the availability of adequate supply commitments from our wafer foundries and assembly and test subcontractors 
as a result of these factors  our past financial results are not necessarily a good predictor of our future results 
our stock price may continue to experience large fluctuations 
in recent years  the price of our common stock has fluctuated greatly 
these price fluctuations have been rapid and severe and have left investors little time to react 
the price of our common stock may continue to fluctuate greatly in the future due to a variety of company specific factors  including quarter to quarter variations in our operating results  shortfalls in revenue or earnings from levels expected by securities analysts  and announcements of technological innovations or new products by other companies 
presently  our stock price is trading near our consolidated book value 
a sustained decline in our stock price may result in a write off of goodwill see note of our consolidated financial statements 
our wafer supply may be interrupted or reduced  which may result in a shortage of finished products available for sale 
we do not manufacture finished silicon wafers 
currently  substantially all of our silicon wafers are manufactured by seiko epson in japan  umc in taiwan  and chartered semiconductor in singapore 
in march we announced that we will also be sourcing wafers on advanced process technologies from fujitsu in japan 
if any of our current or future foundry partners significantly interrupts or reduces our wafer supply  our operating results could be harmed 
in the past  we have experienced delays in obtaining wafers and in securing supply commitments from our foundries 
at present  we anticipate that our supply commitments are adequate 
however  these existing supply commitments may not be sufficient for us to satisfy customer demand in future periods 
additionally  notwithstanding our supply commitments we may still have difficulty in obtaining wafer deliveries consistent with the supply commitments 
we negotiate wafer prices and supply commitments from our suppliers on at least an annual basis 
if any of our foundry partners were to reduce its supply commitment or increase its wafer prices  and we cannot find alternative sources of wafer supply  our operating results could be harmed 
many other factors that could disrupt our wafer supply are beyond our control 
since worldwide manufacturing capacity for silicon wafers is limited and inelastic  we could be harmed by significant industry wide increases in overall wafer demand or interruptions in wafer supply 
additionally  a future disruption of any of our foundry partners foundry operations as a result of a fire  earthquake or other natural disaster could disrupt our wafer supply and could harm our operating results 
if our foundry partners experience quality or yield problems  we may face a shortage of finished products available for sale 
we depend on our foundries to deliver reliable silicon wafers with acceptable yields in a timely manner 
as is common in our industry  we have experienced wafer yield problems and delivery delays 
if our foundries are unable for a prolonged period to produce silicon wafers that meet our specifications  with acceptable yields  our operating results could be harmed 
the majority of our revenue is derived from products based on a specialized silicon wafer manufacturing process technology called e cmos 
the reliable manufacture of high performance e cmos semiconductor wafers is a complicated and technically demanding process requiring a high degree of technical skill  state of the art equipment  the absence of defects in the masks used to print circuits on a wafer  the elimination of minute impurities and errors in each step of the fabrication process  and effective cooperation between us and the wafer supplier 
as a result  our foundries may experience difficulties in achieving acceptable quality and yield levels when manufacturing our silicon wafers 
if our assembly and test contractors experience quality or yield problems  we may face a shortage of finished products available for sale 
we rely on contractors to assemble and test our devices with acceptable quality and yield levels 
as is common in our industry  we have experienced quality and yield problems in the past 
if we experience prolonged quality or yield problems in the future  our operating results could be harmed 
the majority of our revenue is derived from semiconductor devices assembled in advanced packages 
the assembly of advanced packages is a complex process requiring a high degree of technical skill  state of the art equipment  the absence of defects in lead frames used to attach semiconductor devices to the package  the elimination of raw material impurities and errors in each step of the process  and effective cooperation between us and the assembly contractor 
as a result  our contractors may experience difficulties in achieving acceptable quality and yield levels when assembling and testing our semiconductor devices 
deterioration of conditions in asia may disrupt our existing supply arrangements and result in a shortage of finished products available for sale 
all of our major silicon wafer suppliers operate fabs located in asia 
our finished silicon wafers are assembled and tested by independent contractors located in china  malaysia  the philippines  south korea and taiwan 
a prolonged interruption in our supply from any of these contractors could harm our operating results 
economic  financial  social and political conditions in asia have historically been volatile 
financial difficulties  governmental actions or restrictions  prolonged work stoppages or any other difficulties experienced by our suppliers may disrupt our supply and could harm our operating results 
our wafer purchases from seiko epson are denominated in japanese yen 
the value of the dollar with respect to the yen fluctuates 
substantial deterioration of dollar yen exchange rates could harm our operating results 
export sales account for a substantial portion of our revenues and may decline in the future due to economic and governmental uncertainties 
our export sales are affected by unique risks frequently associated with foreign economies including changes in local economic conditions  exchange rate volatility  governmental controls and trade restrictions  export license requirements and restrictions on the export of technology  political instability or terrorism  changes in tax rates  tariffs or freight rates  interruptions in air transportation  and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign sales offices 
for example  our export sales have historically been affected by regional economic crises 
significant changes in the economic climate in the foreign countries where we derive our export sales could harm our operating results 
we may not be able to successfully compete in the highly competitive semiconductor industry 
the semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and many of our direct and indirect competitors have substantially greater financial  technological  manufacturing  marketing and sales resources 
if we are unable to compete successfully in this environment  our future results will be adversely affected 
the current level of competition in the programmable logic market is high and may increase in the future 
we currently compete directly with companies that have licensed our technology or have developed similar products 
we also compete indirectly with numerous semiconductor companies that offer products and solutions based on alternative technologies 
these direct and indirect competitors are established multinational semiconductor companies as well as emerging companies 
we also may experience significant competition from foreign companies in the future 
we may fail to retain or attract the specialized technical and management personnel required to successfully operate our business 
to a greater degree than most non technology companies or larger technology companies  our future success depends on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical and management personnel 
as a mid sized company  we are particularly dependent on a relatively small group of key employees 
competition for skilled technical and management employees is intense within our industry 
as a result  we may not be able to retain our existing key technical and management personnel 
in addition  we may not be able to attract additional qualified employees in the future 
if we are unable to retain existing key employees or are unable to hire new qualified employees  our operating results could be adversely affected 
if we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights  our financial results and competitive position may suffer 
our success depends in part on our proprietary technology 
however  we may fail to adequately protect this technology 
as a result  we may lose our competitive position or face significant expense to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights 
we intend to continue to protect our proprietary technology through patents  copyrights and trade secrets 
despite this intention  we may not be successful in achieving adequate protection 
claims allowed on any of our patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology 
patents issued to us also may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
finally  our competitors may develop similar technology independently 
companies in the semiconductor industry vigorously pursue their intellectual property rights 
if we become involved in protracted intellectual property disputes or litigation we may utilize substantial financial and management resources  which could have an adverse effect on our operating results 
our industry is characterized by frequent claims regarding patents and other intellectual property rights of others 
we have been  and from time to time expect to be  notified of claims that we are infringing the intellectual property rights of others 
if any third party makes a valid claim against us  we could face significant liability and could be required to make material changes to our products and processes 
in response to any claims of infringement  we may seek licenses under patents that we are alleged to be infringing 
however  we may not be able to obtain a license on favorable terms or without our operating results being adversely affected 
our marketable securities  which we hold for strategic reasons  are subject to equity price risk and their value may fluctuate 
currently we hold substantial equity in umc  which we acquired as part of a strategic investment to obtain certain manufacturing rights 
the market price and valuation of these equity shares has fluctuated widely due to market and other conditions over which we have little control 
during the year ended december   we recorded a million pre tax impairment loss related to this investment 
in the future  umc shares may continue to experience significant price volatility 
in the second quarter of and the first quarter of  we sold a portion of our umc shares  but have otherwise not attempted to reduce or eliminate this equity price risk through hedging or similar techniques and hence substantial  sustained changes in the market price of umc shares could impact our financial results 
to the extent that the market value of our umc shares experiences a significant decline for an extended period of time  our net income could be reduced 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december  and december  our investment portfolio consisted of fixed income securities of million and million  respectively 
as with all fixed income instruments  these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase 
if market rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels as of december  and december   the decline in the fair value of our portfolio would not be material 
further  we have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity and  therefore  we would not expect to recognize such an adverse impact in our income or cash flows 
we have international subsidiary and branch operations 
additionally  some of our silicon wafer purchases are denominated in japanese yen 
we therefore are subject to foreign currency rate exposure 
to mitigate rate exposure with respect to our yen denominated wafer purchases  we maintain a yen denominated bank account and bill our japanese customers in yen 
if the foreign currency rates were to fluctuate by from rates at december  and december   the effect on our consolidated financial statements would not be material 
however  there can be no assurance that there will not be a material impact in the future 
we are exposed to equity price risk due to our equity investment in umc see note to our consolidated financial statements 
neither a increase nor a further decrease in equity price related to this investment would have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
we have not attempted to reduce or eliminate this equity price risk through hedging or similar techniques 
as a result  sustained changes in the market price of umc shares could impact our financial results 
to the extent that the market value of our umc shares experiences further deterioration for an extended period of time  our net income could be reduced
