major events impacting financial condition and results of operations in december  the company s agreement with the st 
barnabas medical center based fertility center was terminated early 
the company received million in liquidated damages pursuant to an early termination agreement 
these funds were recorded as revenue by the company during as compensation for certain performance obligations contained in the termination agreement 
during  the company negotiated revised fee structures on all five of its then existing major fertilitypartners contracts 
on four of these contracts in which service fees are comprised of a a tiered percentage of revenue  b a fixed percentage of fertility center earnings and c reimbursed cost of services 
the company negotiated lower percentages on the revenue and fertility center earnings components 
these lower revenue percentages were to be phased in over an approximate five year period 
in  fee structures on three of these contracts were revised as described below 
on the remaining fertilitypartners contract  the company negotiated higher service fees  which were assessed at a fixed amount each month independent of the fertility center s underlying revenue or earnings 
the company terminated its fertilitypartner agreement with this fertility center effective june   and currently maintains a relationship with this center under its fertilitydirect program 
on april   the company signed a fertilitypartners agreement with the margate  florida based northwest center for infertility and reproductive endocrinology ncire 
under the terms of the year agreement  the company s service fees are comprised of reimbursed costs of services  a tiered percentage of revenues  and an additional fixed percentage of ncire earnings 
the company has budgeted up to million to fund the development and equipping of a new state of the art facility to house the clinical practice and embryology laboratory for ncire and its patients

these warrants become exercisable july  and will expire on july  on november   the company announced the ending of its fertilitypartners agreement with rsa of new york 
the agreement ended on november  rsa of new york serves the long island market and revenues for the four quarterly periods ending prior to the announcement were million 
the program had a contribution of  for the same period 
at the time of the announcement  the company evaluated its exclusive business rights asset associated with rsa of new york and reduced that asset to its realizable value by adjusting the asset downward by  during  the company again negotiated revised fee structures on three of its existing fertilitypartner contracts 
in all three of these contracts  the timetable for the phase in of that portion of the fee reductions which are based on the earnings of the underlying fertility centers  and which were negotiated in and are described above  were delayed by one year 
beginning in the year  two of these revised contracts  also contain a maximum limit on the amount of fees the company can earn  which are based on the earnings of the underlying fertility centers 
these maximum limitations are below the fees earned by the company on these portions of the contracts in the third contract contains no maximum limitation 
the company believes that these fee limitations will be offset by volume based increases in fees earned in other areas of its existing contracts  the sale of new fertilitypartner contracts and growth in its fertilitydirect business unit

critical accounting policies in december  the sec requested that all registrants list their most critical accounting policies in md a 
the sec indicated that a critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we believe that the following accounting policies fit this definition basis of consolidation the consolidated financial statements comprise the accounts of integramed america  inc and its wholly owned subsidiaries 
all significant inter company transactions have been eliminated 
the company principally derives its revenues from fertilitypartners contracts  the sale of pharmaceutical products and patients enrolling in its shared risk refund program 
the company does not have a controlling financial interest in any of the medical practices to which it provides services and as such does not consolidate their results 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related footnotes 
in preparing these financial statements  management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
the company does not believe there is a great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported related to the accounting policies described below 
however  application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
revenue and cost recognition fertilitypartners service fees as of december   the company provided comprehensive services to fertility centers under six fertilitypartners contracts 
under all six agreements  the company receives as compensation for its services a three part fee comprised of i a tiered percentage of net revenues  ii reimbursed costs of services costs incurred in servicing a fertility center and any costs paid on behalf of the fertility center and iii a fixed percentage of earnings after services fees 
all revenues from fertilitypartners service fees are recorded in the period services are rendered 
direct costs incurred by the company in performing its services and costs incurred on behalf of the medical practices are reported as costs of services 
revenue and costs are recognized in the same period in which the related services have been performed 
pharmaceutical sales the company distributes fertility related pharmaceutical products through ipsi 
the company has a servicing arrangement with ivpcare  inc  to fulfill the purchase and distribution of those pharmaceuticals 
ipsi accepts patient orders  verifies patient insurance coverage where applicable and ships prescription based pharmaceuticals directly to patients of certain affiliated fertility centers 
revenue is derived from the sales of these pharmaceuticals and is recorded  along with the related costs including the fee due ivpcare  when shipments are made 
the cost of pharmaceutical products purchased is recorded as a cost of sales and is not offset against revenues 
pharmaceutical sales accounts receivable represent receivables held by ipsi for medications sold directly to patients 
risk of loss in connection with uncollectibility of these accounts receivable is borne by the company 
shared risk refund program the shared risk refund program consists of a fertility treatment package that includes up to three cycles of in vitro fertilization for one fixed price with a significant refund if the patient does not deliver a baby 
under this innovative financial program  the company receives payment directly from consumers who qualify for the program and pays contracted fertility centers a defined reimbursement for each treatment cycle performed 
expenses related to the program are recorded as incurred 
potentially refundable revenues are deferred until the pregnancy outcome is determined 
the company manages the risk associated with the shared risk refund program through a case management program 
this case management program authorizes patient care and provides information to be used in recognizing revenue 
a reserve for estimated refunds due to pregnancy loss is maintained and based on historical averages of pregnancy losses applied to the revenues recorded within the applicable periods 
due from medical practices due from medical practices represents the net amounts owed to the company by the medical practices 
this balance is comprised of amounts owed to the company by the medical practices for funds  which the company has advanced to the practices for use in financing their accounts receivable  less balances owed to the medical practices by the company for undistributed amounts earned by their physicians 
due from medical practices excludes amounts owed by the company to medical practices for acquired exclusive services rights since the financial accounting standards board interpretation conditions for offset are not met for these obligations 
such acquired rights are reported as intangible assets

 accounting for income taxes fas

revenues of million in ii revenue at the company s pharmaceutical unit decreased by million  or 
this reduction in revenue was the result of the company s decision to de emphasize the sale of certain high volume products due to the lack of profitability resulting from pricing pressures within the market

contribution of million in ii pharmaceutical contribution declined by million  or  during and margin rates slipped to from in the prior year 
the decline in contribution was a result of the company s decision to de emphasize certain specific high volume pharmaceuticals products  which became unprofitable due to manufacturer pricing increases coupled with insurance reimbursement reductions 
the company believes these pricing issues are resolved by payers acceptance of increased prices and anticipates its pharmaceutical margin to improve in iii contribution in the company s fertilitydirect program increased million  or during these increases were driven by increased shared risk refund patient volume  additional fertility clinics participating in the fertilitydirect program as well as a higher monthly fee structure for these clinics 
general and administrative expenses increased by million  to million in from million in this increase is mainly the result of additional marketing costs in support of the company s fertilitydirect program  and costs associated with new regulatory compliance requirements 
interest income rose to  for the year ended december   from  in this increase is attributable to additional interest income earned on capital investments at some fertilitypartner clinics 
interest expense declined to  for the year ended december  from  for as a result of scheduled debt reductions in the first two quarters of the provisions for income tax were approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively

calendar year compared to calendar year revenues for the year ended december  increased by million  or  from the year ended the main factors contributing to this increase were i revenues increased at the core fertilitypartners centers as a result of increased patient volume 
same center growth was over the prior year

in addition  the fertilitypartners agreement signed with ncire in april  contributed approximately million of revenue for the year ended december ii the company s pharmaceutical division experienced a increase in revenue

iii fertilitydirect revenues  comprised primarily of the company s shared risk refund program  increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the company anticipates that continued growth of this program  driven in part by focused marketing efforts  will become a significant component of its direct to consumer orientation 
contribution of million in remained unchanged from as a percentage of revenue  the contribution margin decreased to in from in the following factors contributed to the stability of the contribution i as previously disclosed  the company s revised fee structure with its fertilitypartners contracts provides for reduced fees and margins on the incremental earnings of those centers 
during  while continued growth of the fertilitypartners contracts resulted in greater aggregate revenues for the company  several components of this revenue stream were at the lower contractual incremental margins 
during  the company adopted eitf  accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer or a reseller of the vendor s products  which required the company to report its revenue net of the amortization of its services rights 
while revenue for all years presented has been restated to reflect this change  results for include a  write down of service rights related to the mutual termination of the company s new york based fertilitypartners agreement 
ii the company s pharmaceutical sales  which grew by million  or  during the year ended december   have a margin of approximately  which is substantially below the margin of the company s other revenue components 
as the company s pharmaceutical segment continues to expand faster than the company s other product lines  the weighted impact will be an anticipated reduction in the company s margins

interest income declined from  for the year ended december  to  in as a result of falling interest rates 
income tax provisions benefits were approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the benefit was a result of reducing the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets due to sustained profitability over an extended period and the increased likelihood of realization of the deferred tax assets 
there have been no current federal income tax payments due to the utilization of the net operating loss carry forwards 
the company s effective tax rate for was approximately and reflects credits for the reversal of state taxes provided in prior periods
