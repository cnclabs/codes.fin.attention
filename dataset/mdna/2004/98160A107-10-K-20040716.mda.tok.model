critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to its most critical accounting policies  on an ongoing basis 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
franchise revenues franchise revenues consist of royalties and franchise fees 
the company recognizes royalties on a franchisee s sales in the period in which the sales occur 
the company also receives a franchise fee for each restaurant that a franchisee opens 
the recognition of franchise fees is deferred until the company has performed substantially all of its related obligations as a franchisor  typically when a restaurant opens 
property and equipment the company reviews its long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable 
the company considers a history of operating losses and insufficient future revenue potential to be its primary indicators of potential impairment 
assets are grouped and evaluated for impairment at the lowest level  typically the restaurant level for which there are identifiable cash flows independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets 
the company deems an asset to be impaired if a forecast of undiscounted projected future operating cash flows directly related to the asset  including disposal value  if any  is less than its carrying amount 
projected future operating cash flows are based on budgeted future operating results and forecast estimates 
considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate projected future operating cashflows 
accordingly  if actual results fall short of such estimates  significant future impairments could result 
goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized  estimated useful lives range from to years 
goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired 
sfas no 
requires a two step process for testing impairment 
first  the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying value to determine whether an indication of impairment exists 
if an impairment is indicated  then the fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill is determined by allocating the unit s fair value to its assets and liabilities including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination 
the amount of impairment for goodwill and other intangible assets is measured as the excess of its carrying value over its fair value 
the company has established its reporting units based on its current reporting structure and all recognized assets  liabilities and goodwill have been assigned to these reporting units 
considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate fair value 
accordingly  actual results could vary from such estimates 
income taxes at april   the book value of the company s deferred income tax assets  prior to considering any valuation allowance  was approximately million  of which approximately million was domestic 
the principal component of the domestic deferred income tax assets was comprised of federal and state net operating loss carryforwards 
the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  require a valuation allowance when in management s judgment  based upon currently available information and other factors  it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred income tax asset will not be realized 
the company bases its determination of the need for a valuation allowance on an on going evaluation of current information including  among other things  estimates of future earnings in different tax jurisdictions and the expected timing of deferred income tax asset reversals 
a charge or credit to income tax expense is made for any adjustments to the valuation allowance in the period in which these determinations are made 
during the year ended april   the valuation allowance was reduced by approximately million  an amount that resulted in the net domestic deferred tax asset remaining at million 
at april   the company s valuation allowance against its domestic deferred income tax assets was approximately million 
the company believes that the determination to record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred income tax assets is a critical accounting estimate because it is based on an estimate of future taxable income in the united states  which is susceptible to change and may or may not occur  and because the impact of adjusting a valuation allowance may be material 
self insurance the company self insures a significant portion of its workers compensation  general liability and health insurance plans 
the full extent of certain claims  in many cases  may not become fully determined for several years 
the company  therefore  estimates the potential obligation for liabilities which have been incurred as well as those which have been incurred but not yet reported based upon historical data and experience  and utilizes an outside consulting firm to assist the company in developing these estimates 
although management believes that the amounts accrued for these obligations are sufficient  any significant increase in either the number of claims and or costs associated with claims made under these plans could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial results 
supplemental executive retirement plan the company terminated its supplemental executive retirement plan serp but continues to remain obligated under the serp for former employees 
the company accounts for the serp under sfas no 
employers accounting for pensions 
the company makes significant assumptions used in determining the net pension cost and benefit obligation 
significant assumptions used include discount rates and mortality estimates  which are determined with the assistance of an outside consulting firm 
although management believes that the amounts accrued for these benefit obligations are sufficient  any changes in these assumptions could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial results 
in connection with the serp  the company has several life insurance policies covering certain former employees including those in the serp

market and operating partnerships during fiscal year  pat oscar s began offering equity interests to its regional and restaurant management each participant  an equity partner 
this equity plan was established to create and promote a strong sense of ownership among its key managers and enhance the development  operation and performance of pat oscar s 
each equity partner  generally a regional market manager or a restaurant general manager  is allowed to purchase an ownership interest in a limited liability company that operates and owns or leases substantially all of the restaurant assets from pat oscar s 
the ownership interest purchased by the equity partner is based on fair market value and ranges from two percent to eight percent of the partnership  which includes only the restaurants that the equity partner oversees 
the equity partner is restricted from selling the ownership interest for an initial period of five years 
at the end of the initial term the equity partner has the option to continue operating on a month to month basis  renew the agreement for another five years and purchase an additional one to two percent interest or sell their interest to pat oscar s at the then prevailing fair market value 
fair market value will be determined in accordance with reasonable and consistent valuation methods and procedures and will consider among other things such factors as the restaurant s remaining lease life  historic profitability and continued profitability of the restaurant s 
the price paid by pat oscar s to repurchase the ownership interest  at the option of the equity partner  subject to the company s approval  may be made either in the form of a note  the company s common stock or percent cash and percent company common stock 
there is no public market for these interests  therefore the fair market value determinations are subjective and require the use of estimates for which significant judgments are required 
periodically  the company may engage outside experts to assess the reasonableness of the methodology the company uses to estimate fair market value 
during fiscal year  the initial investment made by three equity partners was offset by operating losses which were allocated to the equity partners resulting  in part  from the e 
coli incident  see note e 
coli incident  to consolidated financial statements

fifty two weeks ended april  consolidated revenues were million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year  an increase of million or percent 
the increase is due to a million increase in revenue from the international division partially offset by declines of approximately million from the domestic division

sizzler us revenues were lower due to having seven fewer company owned restaurants open of which five were converted to franchise operations and to a decline in same store sales at company operated restaurants 
there was one additional pat oscar s restaurant opened compared to the prior year  but the revenue increase was partially offset by significant declines in the same store sales following the e 
coli incident and related news stories see notes commitments and contingencies and e

coli incident  pat oscar s will continue to experience weakened sales and profitability at least through the first half of fiscal year in an amount not presently quantifiable

the company believes that it has meritorious claims for damages in the amount of such losses against certain suppliers in its produce supply chain as a result of this incident  however  there can be no assurance that  if the company does file such claims  it will be successful therein  or in any specific amount 
the company has not recorded any asset nor reduced any expense in anticipation of any potential insurance recovery

interest rate risk on july   the company entered into a revised credit facility revised credit facility with westpac banking corporation in australia westpac that replaced its prior credit facility prior credit facility

at april   the company s unpaid principal balance on the revised credit facility was approximately million million in australian dollars 
the primary exposure relating to this financial instrument results from changes in interest rates 
to hedge the company s exposure to interest rate increases on this loan  the company is party to an interest rate cap contract that prevents the company s interest rate excluding margin from exceeding percent  in which case the company would receive the difference between the contract rate and the actual interest rate 
at april   the interest rate cap covered approximately percent of the loan principal outstanding and expires on january  in addition  the company is party to an interest rate swap contract to convert part of its variable interest exposure to a fixed rate of percent excluding margin 
at april   the interest rate swap contract covered approximately percent of the loan principal outstanding and expires on january  the company also has a term loan in the amount of million with variable interest as a result of the acquisition of pat oscar s 
the interest rates ranged from to percent during fiscal year the company calculated that a hypothetical percent change in the interest rates  as defined above  in the near term would change interest expense by million

the company has mitigated the risk with a bank loan payable in australian dollars  which reduces the company s exposure by decreasing its net investment 
as of april   the company s net equity in its australian subsidiaries was million 
the company calculated that a hypothetical percent change in the australian exchange rate in the near term would result in approximately a million change in the net equity in the australian subsidiaries 
the company calculated that a hypothetical percent change in the australian exchange rate in the near term would result in approximately a million change in the net income 
commodity price risk the company s commodity price risk is attributable to fluctuations in the price of selected food products such as meat  poultry and produce used in the normal course of business 
the company contracts for certain amounts of these food products in the future at a predetermined or fixed price in order to hedge the risk of changes in the market price 
the company does not purchase futures contracts for trading purposes 
the company is unable to predict the possible impact of changes in commodity prices 
however  in the past the company has been able to address these changes by passing these costs along to its customers because these changes have generally impacted all restaurant companies
