table of contents the increase in americas revenue of million  or  for was primarily attributable to an increase in revenues from our offshore operations  including latin america  india and the asia pacific rim  resulting from the continued acceleration in demand for a lower cost customer contact management solution as well as further diversification into new vertical markets 
these offshore operations represented of consolidated revenues for compared to for we expect this trend of generating more of our revenues from offshore operations to continue into the increase in the americas revenue was partially offset by the overall reduction in customer call volumes resulting from the economic downturn and the phasing out of two us based original equipment manufacturer oem technology clients 
we anticipate that as our offshore operations grow and become a larger percentage of revenues  the total revenue and revenue growth rate may decline since the average revenue per seat generated offshore is less than it is in north america and europe 
while the average offshore revenue per seat is less  the operating margins generated offshore are generally comparable or higher than those in north america and europe 
however  our ability to maintain these offshore operating margins longer term is difficult to predict due to potential increased competition for the available workforce in offshore markets 
the increase in emea s revenue of million  or  for was primarily related to the strengthening euro  which positively impacted revenues for by approximately million compared to the euro in without this foreign currency benefit  emea s revenues would have declined million compared with last year due to the continued softness in customer call volumes resulting from the weak european economy 
direct salaries and related costs direct salaries and related costs increased million or to million for  from million in as a percentage of revenues  direct salaries and related costs increased to in from for this increase was primarily attributable to an increase in staffing and training costs associated with the ramp up of new business in our offshore operations  lower call volumes in the united states and europe and lower margin european centers that were closed in the first quarter of in connection with our restructuring plan 
we expect that we will continue to experience an increase in staffing and training costs through associated with this migration offshore 
although the strengthening euro positively impacted revenues  it increased direct salaries and related costs for by approximately million compared to the euro in general and administrative general and administrative expenses increased million or to million for  from million in as a percentage of revenues  general and administrative expenses decreased to in from in this decrease was principally attributable to lower depreciation and bad debt expense partially offset by higher insurance and compliance costs as well as higher lease  travel  training  utilities and maintenance costs associated with the expansion of offshore facilities and certain duplicative operating costs related to the call volumes migrating offshore 
we expect that we will continue to experience certain duplicative operating costs through associated with this migration offshore 
similar to the negative effect on direct salaries and related costs  the strengthening euro also increased general and administrative expenses for by approximately million compared to the euro in net gain on disposal of property and equipment the net gain on disposal of property and equipment of million for included a million net gain on the sale of our scottsbluff  nebraska facility which was closed in connection with the restructuring plan and a million portion of the net gain related to the installment sale of our eveleth  minnesota facility offset by a million loss on disposal of property and equipment

these offshore operations represented over of consolidated revenues for compared to for  exclusive of us fulfillment and distribution operations 
the decrease in emea s revenue of million  or  for was primarily related to the loss of a dot 
com client that filed for bankruptcy in as well as a decline in customer call volumes affected by the economic downturn in both outsourced customer contact management solutions and services and fulfillment services 
this decrease was partially offset by the strengthening euro  which positively impacted revenues for by approximately million compared to the euro in direct salaries and related costs direct salaries and related costs decreased million or to million for  from million in as a percentage of revenues  direct salaries and related costs remained unchanged at in each of and exclusive of us fulfillment operations  direct salaries and related costs  as a percentage of revenues  decreased to in from for although the strengthening euro positively impacted revenues  it increased direct salaries and related costs for by approximately million compared to the euro in general and administrative general and administrative expenses decreased million or to million for  from million in as a percentage of revenues  general and administrative expenses increased to in from for the decrease in the dollar amount of general and administrative expenses was attributable to a million decrease in salaries and benefits related to reductions in certain administrative and operating personnel  a million decrease in telephone costs  a million decrease in consulting costs  a million decrease in legal and professional fees  million decrease in bad debt expense  a million decrease in net depreciation expense related principally to the

the restructuring plan was designed to reduce costs and bring the company s infrastructure in line with the current business environment 
in connection with the restructuring  we recorded additional depreciation expense of million in related to a specialized technology platform which will no longer be utilized upon the expiration of the previously mentioned client contracts in march we also reduced the number of employees by during and during the charges included the closure and consolidation of two us customer contact management centers  two us technical staffing offices and one european fulfillment center  the elimination of redundant property  leasehold improvements and equipment  lease termination costs associated with vacated properties and equipment  and severance and related costs

liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity are generally cash flows generated by operating activities and from available borrowings under our revolving credit facilities 
we have utilized these capital resources to make capital expenditures associated primarily with our customer contact management services  invest in technology applications and tools to further develop our service offerings and for working capital and other general corporate purposes  including repurchase of our common stock in the open market and to fund possible acquisitions 
in future periods  we intend similar uses of these funds 
in  we paid million which was accrued for previously in connection with the restructuring plans to close and consolidate several customer contact management centers in the united states and europe 
on august   we announced that our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to three million shares of our outstanding common stock 
the shares of common stock are purchased  from time to time  through open market purchases or in negotiated private transactions  and the purchases are based on factors including  but not limited to  the stock price and general market conditions 
in  we repurchased thousand common shares under the repurchase program at prices ranging from to per share for a total cost of million 
in  we generated million in cash from operating activities  million in cash from the sale of facilities  property and equipment  and million in cash from issuance of stock 
further  we used million in funds for investments in capital expenditures and million to repurchase stock in the open market resulting in a million increase in available cash net of the effects of international currency exchange rates on cash of million 

table of contents net cash flows provided by operating activities for declined million compared to although net income increased million  it was more than offset by a million decrease in non cash flow reconciling items and a million increase associated with changes in assets and liabilities 
the million decrease in non cash flow reconciling items was primarily due to several items which did not recur in including a million litigation settlement  restructuring and other charges of million and an impairment charge of million 
the million increase associated with changes in assets and liabilities was principally a result of a million increase in receivables due to an increase in revenues and slower collections  partially offset by million in cash generated from net higher payables and accrued liabilities 
capital expenditures  which are generally funded by cash generated from operating activities and borrowings available under our credit facilities  were million for compared to million for  an increase of million 
in  approximately of the capital expenditures were the result of investing in new and existing customer contact management centers  primarily offshore  and was expended primarily for maintenance and systems infrastructure 
as a result of the offshore expansion  we anticipate capital expenditures in the first quarter of to be in the range of million to million  which is estimated to be higher than what we expect for the full year 
in  the primary sources of cash flows from financing activities were from borrowings under our revolving credit facility  which we elected to cancel effective as of december  there were no outstanding balances on this credit facility as of december  we are currently negotiating a new revolving credit facility with a group of lenders  which we expect to close in the first quarter of at december   we had million in cash  of which approximately million was held in international operations and may be subject to additional taxes if repatriated to the united states 
we believe that our current cash levels and cash flows from future operations will be adequate to meet anticipated working capital needs  future debt repayment requirements if any  continued expansion objectives  anticipated levels of capital expenditures for the foreseeable future and stock repurchases 
off balance sheet arrangements and other at december   we did not have any material commercial commitments  including guarantees or standby repurchase obligations  or any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  including entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities or variable interest entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
from time to time  during the normal course of business  we may make certain indemnities  commitments and guarantees under which we may be required to make payments in relation to certain transactions 
these include i indemnities to vendors and service providers pertaining to claims based on our negligence or willful misconduct and ii indemnities involving the accuracy of representations and warranties in certain contracts 
in addition  we have agreements whereby we indemnify certain officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is  or was  serving at our request in such capacity 
the indemnification period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the officer s or director s lifetime 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited  however  we have director and officer insurance coverage 
table of contents that limits our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid 
we believe the applicable insurance coverage is generally adequate to cover any estimated potential liability under these indemnification agreements 
the majority of these indemnities  commitments and guarantees do not provide for any limitation of the maximum potential for future payments we could be obligated to make 
we have not recorded any liability for these indemnities  commitments and other guarantees in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations at december   and the effect these obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flow in future periods in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years after years capital lease obligations operating leases accrued restructuring charges purchase obligations other long term liabilities total contractual cash obligations amounts represent the expected cash payments of our capital lease obligations and operating leases as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
amounts represent the expected cash payments in connection with the and restructuring plans as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty 
other long term liabilities  which exclude deferred income taxes  represent the expected cash payments due minority shareholders of certain subsidiaries 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires estimations and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
these estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical since these policies require significant judgment or involve complex estimations that are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results we recognize revenue pursuant to applicable accounting standards  including sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements  sab  revenue recognition and the emerging issues task force eitf no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
sab  as amended  and sab summarize certain of the sec staff s views in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements and provides guidance on revenue recognition issues in the absence of authoritative literature addressing a specific arrangement or a specific industry 
eitf no 
provides further guidance on how to account for multiple element contracts 
we recognize revenue from services as the services are performed under a fully executed contractual agreement and record estimated reductions to revenue for penalties and holdbacks for failure to meet specified minimum service levels and other performance based contingencies 
royalty revenue is recognized at the time royalties are earned and the remaining revenue is recognized on fixed price contracts using the percentage of completion method of accounting  which relies on estimates of total expected revenue and related costs 
revisions to these estimates  which could result in adjustments to fixed price contracts and estimated losses  are recorded in the period when such adjustments or losses are known 
product sales are recognized upon shipment to the customer and satisfaction of all obligations 
we recognize revenue from licenses of our software products and rights when the agreement has been executed  the product or right has been delivered or provided  collectibility is probable and the software license fees or rights are fixed and determinable 
if any portion of the license fees or rights is subject to forfeiture  refund or other contractual contingencies  we postpone 
table of contents revenue recognition until these contingencies have been removed 
revenue from support and maintenance activities is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance period and the unrecognized portion is recorded as deferred revenue 
certain contracts to sell our products and services contain multiple elements or non standard terms and conditions 
as a result  we evaluate each contract and a thorough contract interpretation is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting  including whether the deliverables specified in a multiple element arrangement should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes  and if so  how the price should be allocated among the deliverable elements and the timing of revenue recognition for each element 
we recognize revenue for delivered elements only when the fair values of undelivered elements are known  uncertainties regarding client acceptance are resolved  and there are no client negotiated refund or return rights affecting the revenue recognized for delivered elements 
changes in the allocation of the sales price between deliverable elements might impact the timing of revenue recognition  but would not change the total revenue recognized on the contract 
we recognize revenue associated with the grants of land and the cash grants for the acquisition of property  buildings and equipment for customer contact management centers over the corresponding useful lives of the related assets 
should the useful lives of these assets change for reasons such as the sale or disposal of the property  the amount of revenue recognized would be adjusted accordingly 
deferred grants totaled million as of december  income from operations included amortization of the deferred grants of million for the year ended december  we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts of million as of december   or of receivables  for estimated losses arising from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in a reduced ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required which would reduce income from operations 
as of december   we had net deferred tax assets of million  which is net of a valuation allowance of million 
we maintain a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if  based on the weight of available evidence for each respective tax jurisdiction  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of such deferred tax assets will not be realized 
available evidence which is considered in determining the amount of valuation allowance required includes  but is not limited to  our estimate of future taxable income and any applicable tax planning strategies 
as of december   we determined the valuation allowance of million was necessary to reduce primarily foreign deferred tax assets  where it was more likely than not that some portion or all of such deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the recoverability of the remaining net deferred tax assets of million is dependent upon future profitability within each tax jurisdiction 
as of december   based on our estimates of future taxable income and any applicable tax planning strategies within these tax jurisdictions  we believe that it is more likely than not that all of these deferred tax assets will be realized 
see note in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we hold a minority interest in shps  incorporated as a result of the sale of a ownership interest in june we account for the remaining interest at cost  which was million as of december  we will record an impairment charge or loss if we believe the investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of the underlying investment could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investment and  therefore  might require an impairment charge in the future 
we review long lived assets  which had a carrying value of million as of december   including goodwill and property and equipment  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable and at least annually for impairment testing of goodwill 
an asset is considered to be impaired when the carrying amount exceeds the fair value 
upon determination that the carrying value of the asset is impaired  we would record an impairment charge or loss to reduce the asset to its fair value 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of the underlying investment could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investment and  therefore  might require an impairment charge in the future 
self insurance related liabilities of million as of december  include estimates for  among other things  projected settlements for known and anticipated claims for worker s compensation and employee health insurance 
key variables in determining such estimates include past claims history  number of covered employees and projected future claims 
we periodically evaluate and  if necessary  adjust the estimates based on information currently available 
revisions to 
table of contents these estimates  which could result in adjustments to the liability and additional charges  would be recorded in the period when such adjustments or charges are known 
related party transactions we paid the chairman and majority shareholder million  million and million for the use of his private jet in  and  respectively  which is based on two times fuel costs and actual costs incurred for each trip 
in  the board of directors determined that a note receivable of million due from our chairman and majority shareholder was a corporate expense to be forgiven and charged against income for the year ended december  during  we terminated an arrangement with a company  in which the chairman and majority shareholder has an equity interest 
for the year ended december   we paid this company million for management and site development services 
a member of our board of directors received broker commissions from our k investment firm of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  and insurance commissions for the placement of various corporate insurance programs of approximately million for each of the two years ended december  and  respectively 
this arrangement was terminated in during  we determined that the payment of these broker commissions was a prohibited transaction under federal regulations 
as a result  during  we reimbursed the k plan million for previously paid broker commissions and will pay a penalty to the us government of approximately million

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency and interest rate risk our earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in non us currency exchange rates 
we are exposed to non us exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of non us subsidiaries are translated into us dollars in consolidation

the cumulative translation effects for subsidiaries using functional currencies other than the us dollar are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss in

movements in non us currency exchange rates may affect our competitive position  as exchange rate changes may affect business practices and or pricing strategies of non us based competitors 
under our current policy  we do not use non us exchange derivative instruments to manage exposure to changes in non us currency exchange rates
