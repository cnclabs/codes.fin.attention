item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a detailed discussion of loans and deposits 
employees 
at december   the company and its subsidiaries employed approximately persons on a full time equivalent basis 
the company believes its employee relations are excellent 
supervision and regulation 
introduction banking is a complex  highly regulated industry 
the primary goals of the regulatory scheme are to maintain a safe and sound banking system  protect depositors and the fdic s insurance fund  and facilitate the conduct of sound monetary policy 
in furtherance of these goals  congress and the states have created several largely autonomous regulatory agencies and enacted numerous laws that govern banks  bank holding companies and the financial services industry 
consequently  the company and its banking subsidiaries are subject to the rules and regulations and the policies of various governmental regulatory authorities  including the frb  the fdic  the office of the comptroller of the currency  or occ  and the california department of financial institutions  or dfi 
the system of supervision and regulation applicable to the company and its banking subsidiaries governs most aspects of their business  including the scope of permissible business  investments  reserves that must be maintained against deposits  capital levels that must be maintained  the nature and amount of collateral that may be taken to secure loans  the establishment of new branches  mergers and consolidations with other financial institutions  and the payment of dividends 
general the company as a bank holding company registered under the bhca  is subject to regulation by the frb 
according to frb policy  the company is expected to act as a source of financial strength for its banking subsidiaries to commit resources to support them in circumstances where the company might not otherwise do so 
under the bhca  the company and its banking subsidiaries are subject to periodic examination by the frb 
the company is also required to file periodic reports of its operations and any additional information regarding its activities and those of its banking subsidiaries with the frb  as may be required 
bank dividends to the company the company is entitled to receive dividends  when and as declared by its subsidiary banks boards of directors 
those dividends may come from funds legally available for those dividends  as specified and limited by the california financial code and the us code 
under the california financial code  funds available for cash dividends by a california chartered bank are restricted to the lesser of i the bank s retained earnings  or ii the bank s net income for its last three fiscal years less any distributions to shareholders made during such period 
with the prior approval of the dfi  cash dividends may also be paid out of the greater of i the bank s retained earnings  ii net income for the bank s last preceding fiscal year  or iii net income for the bank s current fiscal year 
if the dfi determines that the shareholders equity of the bank paying the dividend is not adequate or that the payment of the dividend would be unsafe or unsound for the bank  the dfi may order the bank not to pay the dividend 
under the us code  the board of directors of a national bank may declare the payment of dividends from funds legally available  depending upon the earnings  financial condition and cash needs of the bank and general business conditions 
a national bank may not pay dividends from its capital  as dividends must be paid out of net profits then on hand  after deducting losses and bad debts 
the payment of dividends by a national bank is further restricted by federal law  which prohibits a national bank from declaring a dividend on shares of common stock until its surplus fund equals the amount of capital stock or  if the surplus fund does not equal the amount of the capital stock  until one tenth of the bank s net profits of the preceding half year in the case of quarterly or semi annual dividends  or the preceding two consecutive half year periods in the case of an annual dividend  are transferred to the surplus fund 
moreover  the approval of the occ is required for the payment of dividends if the total of all dividends declared by a national bank in any calendar year would exceed the total of its retained net profits for the year combined with its net profits for the two preceding years  less any required transfers to surplus or a fund for the retirement of any preferred stock 
it is also possible  depending upon its financial condition and other factors  that the dfi  frb  occ and fdic could assert that the payment of dividends or other payments might  under some circumstances  constitute an unsafe or unsound practice and thereby prohibit such payments 
transactions with affiliates the company and any of its subsidiaries and certain related interests are deemed to be affiliates of its subsidiary banks within the meaning of sections a and b of the federal reserve act 
under those terms  loans by a subsidiary bank to affiliates  investments by them in affiliates stock  and taking affiliates stock as collateral for loans to any borrower is limited to of the particular banking subsidiary s capital  in the case of any one affiliate  and is limited to of the banking subsidiary s capital  in the case of all affiliates 
in addition  such transactions must be on terms and conditions that are consistent with safe and sound banking practices  in particular  a bank and its subsidiaries generally may not purchase from an affiliate a low quality asset  as defined in the federal reserve act 
these restrictions also prevent a bank holding company and its other affiliates from borrowing from a banking subsidiary of the bank holding company unless the loans are secured by marketable collateral of designated amounts 
the company and its subsidiary banks are also subject to certain restrictions with respect to engaging in the underwriting  public sale and distribution of securities 
limitations on business and investment activities under the bhca  a bank holding company must obtain the frb s approval before directly or indirectly acquiring more than ownership or control of any voting shares of another bank or bank holding company  acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of another bank  or merging or consolidating with another bank holding company 
the frb may allow a bank holding company to acquire banks located in any state of the united states without regard to whether the acquisition is prohibited by the law of the state in which the target bank is located 
in approving interstate acquisitions  however  the frb must give effect to applicable state laws limiting the aggregate amount of deposits that may be held by the acquiring bank holding company and its insured depository institutions in the state in which the target bank is located  provided that those limits do not discriminate against out of state depository institutions or their holding companies  and state laws which require that the target bank have been in existence for a minimum period of time  not to exceed five years  before being acquired by an out of state bank holding company 
in addition to owning or managing banks  bank holding companies may own subsidiaries engaged in certain businesses that the frb has determined to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto 
the company  therefore  is permitted to engage in a variety of banking related businesses 
some of the activities that the frb has determined  pursuant to its regulation y  to be related to banking are making or acquiring loans or other extensions of credit for its own account or for the account of others  servicing loans and other extensions of credit  operating a trust company in the manner authorized by federal or state law under certain circumstances  leasing personal and real property or acting as agent  broker  or adviser in leasing such property in accordance with various restrictions imposed by frb regulations  providing financial  banking  or economic data processing and data transmission services  owning  controlling  or operating a savings association under certain circumstances  selling money orders  travelers checks and us savings bonds  providing securities brokerage services  related securities credit activities pursuant to regulation t  and other incidental activities  and underwriting and dealing in obligations of the us  general obligations of states and their political subdivisions  and other obligations authorized for state member banks under federal law 
under the recently enacted gramm leach bliley act discussed below qualifying bank holding companies making an appropriate election to the frb may engage in a full range of financial activities  including insurance  securities and merchant banking 
generally  the bhca does not place territorial restrictions on the domestic activities of non bank subsidiaries of bank holding companies 
federal law prohibits a bank holding company and any subsidiary banks from engaging in certain tie in arrangements in connection with the extension of credit 
thus  for example  the company s banking subsidiaries may not extend credit  lease or sell property  or furnish any services  or fix or vary the consideration for any of the foregoing on the condition that the customer must obtain or provide some additional credit  property or services from or to a subsidiary bank other than a loan  discount  deposit or trust service  the customer must obtain or provide some additional credit  property or service from or to the company or any of the banking subsidiaries  or the customer may not obtain some other credit  property or services from competitors  except reasonable requirements to assure soundness of credit extended 
capital adequacy bank holding companies must maintain minimum levels of capital under the frb s risk based capital adequacy guidelines 
if capital falls below minimum guideline levels  a bank holding company  among other things  may be denied approval to acquire or establish additional banks or non bank businesses 
the frb s risk based capital adequacy guidelines for bank holding companies and state member banks assign various risk percentages to different categories of assets  and capital is measured as a percentage of risk assets 
under the terms of the guidelines  bank holding companies are expected to meet capital adequacy guidelines based both on total risk assets and on total assets  without regard to risk weights 
the risk based guidelines are minimum requirements 
higher capital levels will be required if warranted by the particular circumstances or risk profiles of individual organizations 
for example  the frb s capital guidelines contemplate that additional capital may be required to take adequate account of  among other things  interest rate risk  or the risks posed by concentrations of credit  nontraditional activities or securities trading activities 
moreover  any banking organization experiencing or anticipating significant growth or expansion into new activities  particularly under the expanded powers under the gramm leach bliley act  would be expected to maintain capital ratios  including tangible capital positions  well above the minimum levels 
limitations on dividend payments by the company california corporations code section allows the company to pay a dividend to its shareholders only to the extent that it has retained earnings and  after the dividend  its assets exclusive of goodwill and other intangible assets would be times its liabilities exclusive of deferred taxes  deferred income and other deferred credits  and current assets would be at least equal to current liabilities 
additionally  the frb s policy regarding dividends provides that a bank holding company should not pay cash dividends exceeding its net income or which can only be funded in ways that weaken the bank holding company s financial health  such as by borrowing 
the frb also possesses enforcement powers over bank holding companies and their nonbank subsidiaries to prevent or remedy actions that represent unsafe or unsound practices or violations of applicable statutes and regulations 
recent legislation from time to time legislation is enacted which has the effect of increasing the cost of doing business and changing the competitive balance between banks and other financial and non financial institutions 
various federal laws enacted over the past several years have provided  among other things  for the maintenance of mandatory reserves with the federal reserve bank on deposits by depository institutions  the phasing out of the restrictions on the amount of interest which financial institutions may pay on certain types of accounts  and the authorization of various types of new deposit accounts  such as now accounts  money market deposit accounts and super now accounts  designed to be competitive with money market mutual funds and other types of accounts and services offered by various financial and non financial institutions 
the lending authority and permissible activities of certain nonbank financial institutions such as savings and loan associations and credit unions have been expanded  and federal regulators have been given increased enforcement authority 
these laws have generally had the effect of altering competitive relationships existing among financial institutions  reducing the historical distinctions between the services offered by banks  savings and loan associations and other financial institutions  and increasing the cost of funds to banks and other depository institutions

regulatory capital treatment of equity investments 
in december of and january of  the occ  the frb and the fdic on the adopted final rules governing the regulatory capital treatment of equity investments in non financial companies held by banks  bank holding companies and financial holding companies 
the new capital requirements apply symmetrically to equity investments made by banks and their holding companies in non financial companies under the legal authorities specified in the final rules 
among others  these include the merchant banking authority granted by the gramm leach bliley act and the authority to invest in small business investment companies sbics granted by the small business investment act 
covered equity investments will be subject to a series of marginal tier capital charges  with the size of the charge increasing as the organization s level of concentration in equity investments increases 
the highest marginal charge specified in the final rules requires a percent deduction from tier capital for covered investments that aggregate more than percent of an organization s tier capital 
equity investments through sbics will be exempt from the new charges to the extent such investments  in the aggregate  do not exceed percent of the banking organization s tier capital 
grandfathered investments made by state banks under section f of the federal deposit insurance act also are exempted from coverage 
usa patriot act 
the terrorist attacks in september   have impacted the financial services industry and led to federal legislation that attempts to address certain issues involving financial institutions 
on october   president bush signed into law the uniting and strengthening america by providing appropriate tools required to intercept and obstruct terrorism act of part of the usa patriot act is the international money laundering abatement and financial anti terrorism act of imla 
imla authorizes the secretary of the treasury  in consultation with the heads of other government agencies  to adopt special measures applicable to banks  bank holding companies  and or other financial institutions

risk based capital guidelines general 
the federal banking agencies have established minimum capital standards known as risk based capital guidelines 
these guidelines are intended to provide a measure of capital that reflects the degree of risk associated with a bank s operations 
the risk based capital guidelines include both a new definition of capital and a framework for calculating the amount of capital that must be maintained against a bank s assets and off balance sheet items 
the amount of capital required to be maintained is based upon the credit risks associated with the various types of a bank s assets and off balance sheet items 
a bank s assets and off balance sheet items are classified under several risk categories  with each category assigned a particular risk weighting from to 
a bank s risk based capital ratio is calculated by dividing its qualifying capital  which is the numerator of the ratio  by the combined risk weights of its assets and off balance sheet items  which is the denominator of the ratio 
qualifying capital 
a bank s total qualifying capital consists of two types of capital components core capital elements  known as tier capital  and supplementary capital elements  known as tier capital 
the tier component of a bank s qualifying capital must represent at least of total qualifying capital and may consist of the following items that are defined as core capital elements common stockholders equity  qualifying noncumulative perpetual preferred stock including related surplus  and minority interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries 
the tier component of a bank s total qualifying capital may consist of the following items a portion of the allowance for loan and lease losses  certain types of perpetual preferred stock and related surplus  certain types of hybrid capital instruments and mandatory convertible debt securities  and a portion of term subordinated debt and intermediate term preferred stock  including related surplus 
risk weighted assets and off balance sheet items 
assets and credit equivalent amounts of off balance sheet items are assigned to one of several broad risk classifications  according to the obligor or  if relevant  the guarantor or the nature of the collateral 
the aggregate dollar value of the amount in each risk classification is then multiplied by the risk weight associated with that classification 
the resulting weighted values from each of the risk classifications are added together 
this total is the bank s total risk weighted assets 
risk weights for off balance sheet items  such as unfunded loan commitments  letters of credit and recourse arrangements  are determined by a two step process 
first  the credit equivalent amount of the off balance sheet items is determined  in most cases by multiplying the off balance sheet item by a credit conversion factor 
second  the credit equivalent amount is treated like any balance sheet asset and is assigned to the appropriate risk category according to the obligor or  if relevant  the guarantor or the nature of the collateral 
this result is added to the bank s risk weighted assets and comprises the denominator of the risk based capital ratio 
minimum capital standards 
the supervisory standards set forth below specify minimum capital ratios based primarily on broad risk considerations 
the risk based ratios do not take explicit account of the quality of individual asset portfolios or the range of other types of risks to which banks may be exposed  such as interest rate  liquidity  market or operational risks 
for this reason  banks are generally expected to operate with capital positions above the minimum ratios 
all banks are required to meet a minimum ratio of qualifying total capital to risk weighted assets of 
at least must be in the form of tier capital  net of goodwill 
the maximum amount of supplementary capital elements that qualifies as tier capital is limited to of tier capital  net of goodwill 
in addition  the combined maximum amount of subordinated debt and intermediate term preferred stock that qualifies as tier capital is limited to of tier capital 
the maximum amount of the allowance for loan and lease losses that qualifies as tier capital is limited to of gross risk weighted assets 
the allowance for loan and lease losses in excess of this limit may  of course  be maintained  but would not be included in a bank s risk based capital calculation 
the federal banking agencies also require all banks to maintain a minimum amount of tier capital to total assets  referred to as the leverage ratio 
for a bank rated in the highest of the five categories used by regulators to rate banks  the minimum leverage ratio of tier capital to total assets is 
for all banks not rated in the highest category  the minimum leverage ratio must be at least to 
these uniform risk based capital guidelines and leverage ratios apply across the industry 
regulators  however  have the discretion to set minimum capital requirements for individual institutions which may be significantly above the minimum guidelines and ratios 
other factors affecting minimum capital standards the federal banking agencies have established certain benchmark ratios of loan loss reserves to be held against classified assets 
the benchmark by federal banking agencies is the sum of of assets classified loss  of assets classified doubtful  of assets classified substandard  and estimated credit losses on other assets over the upcoming twelve months 
the federal banking agencies have recently revised their risk based capital rules to take account of concentrations of credit and the risks of engaging in non traditional activities 
concentrations of credit refers to situations where a lender has a relatively large proportion of loans involving a single borrower  industry  geographic location  and collateral or loan type 
nontraditional activities are considered those that have not customarily been part of the banking business  but are conducted by a bank as a result of developments in  for example  technology  financial markets or other additional activities permitted by law or regulation 
the regulations require institutions with high or inordinate levels of risk to operate with higher minimum capital standards 
the federal banking agencies also are authorized to review an institution s management of concentrations of credit risk for adequacy and consistency with safety and soundness standards regarding internal controls  credit underwriting or other operational and managerial areas 
the federal banking agencies also limit the amount of deferred tax assets that are allowable in computing a bank s regulatory capital 
deferred tax assets that can be realized for taxes paid in prior carry back years and from future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences are generally not limited 
however  deferred tax assets that can only be realized through future taxable earnings are limited for regulatory capital purposes to the lesser of the amount that can be realized within one year of the quarter end report date  or of tier capital 
the amount of any deferred tax in excess of this limit would be excluded from tier capital  total assets and regulatory capital calculations 
the federal banking agencies have also adopted a joint agency policy statement which provides that the adequacy and effectiveness of a bank s interest rate risk management process and the level of its interest rate exposures are critical factors in the evaluation of the bank s capital adequacy 
a bank with material weaknesses in its interest rate risk management process or high levels of interest rate exposure relative to its capital will be directed by the federal banking agencies to take corrective actions 
financial institutions which have significant amounts of their assets concentrated in high risk loans or nontraditional banking activities  and who fail to adequately manage these risks  may be required to set aside capital in excess of the regulatory minimums 
prompt corrective action the federal banking agencies possess broad powers to take prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of insured banks 
each federal banking agency has issued regulations defining five capital categories well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized  and critically undercapitalized 
under the regulations  a bank shall be deemed to be well capitalized if it has a total risk based capital ratio of or more  has a tier risk based capital ratio of or more  has a leverage capital ratio of or more  and is not subject to specified requirements to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure  adequately capitalized if it has a total risk based capital ratio of or more  a tier risk based capital ratio of or more  and a leverage capital ratio of or more under certain circumstances and does not meet the definition of well capitalized  undercapitalized if it has a total risk based capital ratio that is less than  a tier risk based capital ratio that is less than  or a leverage capital ratio that is less than under certain circumstances  significantly undercapitalized if it has a total risk based capital ratio that is less than  a tier risk based capital ratio that is less than or a leverage capital ratio that is less than  and critically undercapitalized if it has a ratio of tangible equity to total assets that is equal to or less than 
banks are prohibited from paying dividends or management fees to controlling persons or entities if  after making the payment the bank would be undercapitalized  that is  the bank fails to meet the required minimum level for any relevant capital measure 
asset growth and branching restrictions apply to undercapitalized banks 
banks classified as undercapitalized are required to submit acceptable capital plans guaranteed by its holding company  if any 
broad regulatory authority was granted with respect to significantly undercapitalized banks  including forced mergers  growth restrictions  ordering new elections for directors  forcing divestiture by its holding company  if any  requiring management changes  and prohibiting the payment of bonuses to senior management 
even more severe restrictions are applicable to critically undercapitalized banks  those with capital at or less than 
restrictions for these banks include the appointment of a receiver or conservator after days  even if the bank is still solvent 
all of the federal banking agencies have promulgated substantially similar regulations to implement this system of prompt corrective action 
a bank  based upon its capital levels  that is classified as well capitalized  adequately capitalized or undercapitalized may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if the appropriate federal banking agency  after notice and opportunity for a hearing  determines that an unsafe or unsound condition  or an unsafe or unsound practice  warrants such treatment 
at each successive lower capital category  an insured bank is subject to more restrictions 
the federal banking agencies  however  may not treat an institution as critically undercapitalized unless its capital ratios actually warrant such treatment 
interstate banking and branching bank holding companies from any state may generally acquire banks and bank holding companies located in any other state  subject in some cases to nationwide and state imposed deposit concentration limits and limits on the acquisition of recently established banks 
banks also have the ability  subject to specific restrictions  to acquire by acquisition or merger branches located outside their home state 
the establishment of new interstate branches is also possible in those states with laws that expressly permit it 
interstate branches are subject to many of the laws of the states in which they are located 
california law authorizes out of state banks to enter california by the acquisition of or merger with a california bank that has been in existence for at least five years  unless the california bank is in danger of failing or in certain other emergency situations  but limits interstate branching into california to branching by acquisition of an existing bank 
enforcement powers in addition to measures taken under the prompt corrective action provisions  insured banks may be subject to potential enforcement actions by the federal regulators for unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their businesses  or for violation of any law  rule  regulation  condition imposed in writing by the regulatory agency  or term of a written agreement with the regulatory agency 
enforcement actions may include the appointment of a conservator or receiver for the bank  the issuance of a cease and desist order that can be judicially enforced  the termination of the bank s deposit insurance  the imposition of civil monetary penalties  the issuance of directives to increase capital  the issuance of formal and informal agreements  the issuance of removal and prohibition orders against officers  directors and other institution affiliated parties  and the enforcement of such actions through injunctions or restraining orders based upon a judicial determination that the deposit insurance fund or the bank would be harmed if such equitable relief was not granted 
safety and soundness guidelines the federal banking agencies have adopted guidelines to assist in identifying and addressing potential safety and soundness concerns before capital becomes impaired 
these guidelines establish operational and managerial standards relating to internal controls  information systems and internal audit systems  loan documentation  credit underwriting  asset growth  and compensation  fees and benefits 
additionally  the federal banking agencies have adopted safety and soundness guidelines for asset quality and for evaluating and monitoring earnings to ensure that earnings are sufficient for the maintenance of adequate capital and reserves 
if an institution fails to comply with a safety and soundness standard  the appropriate federal banking agency may require the institution to submit a compliance plan 
failure to submit a compliance plan or to implement an accepted plan may result in enforcement action 
the federal banking agencies have issued regulations prescribing uniform guidelines for real estate lending 
the regulations require insured depository institutions to adopt written policies establishing standards  consistent with such guidelines  for extensions of credit secured by real estate 
the policies must address loan portfolio management  underwriting standards and loan to value limits that do not exceed the supervisory limits prescribed by the regulations 
consumer protection laws and regulations the bank regulatory agencies are focusing greater attention on compliance with consumer protection laws and implementing regulations 
examination and enforcement have become more intense in nature  and insured institutions have been advised to carefully monitor compliance with various consumer protection laws and implementing regulations 
banks are subject to many federal consumer protection laws and regulations  including the community reinvestment act  or the cra  the truth in lending act  or the tila  the fair housing act  or the fh act  the equal credit opportunity act  or the ecoa  the home mortgage disclosure act  or the hmda  and the real estate settlement procedures act  or the respa 
the cra is intended to encourage insured depository institutions  while operating safely and soundly  to help meet the credit needs of their communities 
the cra specifically directs the federal bank regulatory agencies  in examining insured depository institutions  to assess their record of helping to meet the credit needs of their entire community  including low and moderate income neighborhoods  consistent with safe and sound banking practices 
the cra further requires the agencies to take a financial institution s record of meeting its community credit needs into account when evaluating applications for  among other things  domestic branches  completing mergers or acquisitions  or holding company formations 
the federal banking agencies have adopted regulations which measure a bank s compliance with its cra obligations on a performance based evaluation system 
this system bases cra ratings on an institution s actual lending service and investment performance rather than the extent to which the institution conducts needs assessments  documents community outreach or complies with other procedural requirements 
the ratings range from outstanding to a low of substantial noncompliance 
the ecoa prohibits discrimination in any credit transaction  whether for consumer or business purposes  on the basis of race  color  religion  national origin  sex  marital status  age except in limited circumstances  receipt of income from public assistance programs  or good faith exercise of any rights under the consumer credit protection act 
in march   the federal interagency task force on fair lending issued a policy statement on discrimination in lending 
the policy statement describes the three methods that federal agencies will use to prove discrimination overt evidence of discrimination  evidence of disparate treatment  and evidence of disparate impact 
this means that if a creditor s actions have had the effect of discriminating  the creditor may be held liable  even when there is no intent to discriminate 
the fh act regulates many practices  including making it unlawful for any lender to discriminate against any person in its housing related lending activities because of race  color  religion  national origin  sex  handicap  or familial status 
the fh act is broadly written and has been broadly interpreted by the courts 
a number of lending practices have been found to be  or may be considered  illegal under the fh act  including some that are not specifically mentioned in the fh act itself 
among those practices that have been found to be  or may be considered  illegal under the fh act are declining a loan for the purposes of racial discrimination  making excessively low appraisals of property based on racial considerations  pressuring  discouraging  or denying applications for credit on a prohibited basis  using excessively burdensome qualifications standards for the purpose or with the effect of denying housing to minority applicants  imposing on minority loan applicants more onerous interest rates or other terms  conditions or requirements  and racial steering  or deliberately guiding potential purchasers to or away from certain areas because of race 
the tila is designed to ensure that credit terms are disclosed in a meaningful way so that consumers may compare credit terms more readily and knowledgeably 
as a result of the tila  all creditors must use the same credit terminology and expressions of rates  the annual percentage rate  the finance charge  and the amount financed  the total payments and the payment schedule 
hmda grew out of public concern over credit shortages in certain urban neighborhoods 
one purpose of hmda is to provide public information that will help show whether financial institutions are serving the housing credit needs of the neighborhoods and communities in which they are located 
hmda also includes a fair lending aspect that requires the collection and disclosure of data about applicant and borrower characteristics as a way of identifying possible discriminatory lending patterns and enforcing anti discrimination statutes 
hmda requires institutions to report data regarding applications for one to four family real estate loans  home improvement loans  and multifamily loans  as well as information concerning originations and purchases of those types of loans 
federal bank regulators rely  in part  upon data provided under hmda to determine whether depository institutions engage in discriminatory lending practices 
respa requires lenders to provide borrowers with disclosures regarding the nature and costs of real estate settlements 
also  respa prohibits certain abusive practices  such as kickbacks  and places limitations on the amount of escrow accounts 
violations of these various consumer protection laws and regulations can result in civil liability to the aggrieved party  regulatory enforcement including civil money penalties  and even punitive damages 
other aspects of banking law the subsidiary banks are also subject to federal and state statutory and regulatory provisions covering  among other things  security procedures  currency and foreign transactions reporting  insider and affiliated party transactions  management interlocks  electronic funds transfers  funds availability  and truth in savings 
there are also a variety of federal statutes which regulate acquisitions of control and the formation of bank holding companies 
impact of monetary policies banking is a business which depends on rate differentials 
in general  the difference between the interest rate paid by a bank on its deposits and its other borrowings and the interest rate earned by a bank on its loans  securities and other interest earning assets comprises the major source of the bank s earnings 
these rates are highly sensitive to many factors which are beyond the bank s control and  accordingly  the earnings and growth of the bank are subject to the influence of economic conditions generally  both domestic and foreign  including inflation  recession  and unemployment  and also to the influence of monetary and fiscal policies of the united states and its agencies  particularly the frb 
the frb implements national monetary policy  such as seeking to curb inflation and combat recession  by its open market dealings in united states government securities  adjusting the required level of reserves for financial institutions subject to reserve requirements  placing limitations upon savings and time deposit interest rates  and adjustments to the discount rate applicable to borrowings by banks which are members of the federal reserve system

recent accounting pronouncements in december   the fasb revised fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin 
this interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  addresses consolidation by business enterprises of a variable interest entity vie that posses certain characteristics 
a company that holds variable interests in an entity will need to consolidate that entity if the company s interest in the vie is such that the company will absorb a majority of the vie s expected losses and or receive a majority of the vie s expected residual returns  if they occur 
the company adopted fin on december  adoption of this standard required the company to deconsolidate its investment in western sierra statutory trust i  western sierra statutory trust ii  western sierra statutory trust iii and western sierra statutory trust iv 
the deconsolidation of the trusts  formed in connection with the issuance of trust preferred securities  appears to be an unintended consequence of fin in management s opinion  the effect of deconsolidation on the company s financial position and results of operations was not material 
in addition  management does not believe that the company has any vies that would be consolidated under the provisions of fin in july  the board of governors of the federal reserve systems issued a supervisory letter instructing bank holding companies to continue to include trust preferred securities in their tier capital for regulatory capital purposes until notice is given to the contrary 
the federal reserve intends to review the regulatory implications of the accounting changes resulting from fin and  if necessary or warranted  provide further appropriate guidance 
there can be no assurance that the federal reserve will continue to allow institutions to include trust preferred securities in tier capital for regulatory capital purposes

application of critical accounting policies critical accounting policies the accounting and reporting policies of the company and its subsidiaries conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and general practices within the financial services industry 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
a summary of the company s most significant accounting policies is contained in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company considers its most critical accounting policies to consist of the allowance for loan and lease losses and the estimation of fair value  which are separately discussed below 
allowance for loan and lease losses 
the allowance for loan and lease losses represents management s best estimate of inherent losses in the existing loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan and lease losses is increased by the provision for losses on loans and leases charged to expense and reduced by loans and leases charged off  net of recoveries 
the provision for loan and lease losses is determined based on management s assessment of several factors reviews and evaluations of specific loans and leases  changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  current economic conditions and the related impact on specific borrowers and industry groups  historical loan and lease loss experience  the level of classified and nonperforming loans and the results of regulatory examinations 
the company s audit committee engages experienced independent loan portfolio review professionals many of which are former bank examiners 
the audit committee determines the scope of such reviews and will provide the report of findings to management and the board s loan committee after they have accepted it 
theses reviews are supplemented with periodic reviews by the company s credit review function  as well as periodic examination of both selected credits and the credit review process by the applicable regulatory agencies 
the information from these reviews assists management in the timely identification of problems and potential problems and provides a basis for deciding whether the credit represents a probable loss or risk that should be recognized 
changes in the financial condition of individual borrowers  in economic conditions  in historical loss experience and in the conditions of the various markets in which collateral may be sold may all affect the required level of the allowance for loan and lease losses and the associated provision for loan and lease losses 
estimation of fair value 
accounting principles generally accepted in the united states require that certain assets and liabilities be carried on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value or at the lower of cost or fair value 
furthermore  the fair value of financial instruments is required to be disclosed as a part of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for other assets and liabilities 
fair values are volatile and may be influenced by a number of factors  including market interest rates  prepayment speeds  discount rates  the shape of yield curves and the credit worthiness of counterparties 
fair values for the majority of the company s available for sale investment securities are based on quoted market prices 
in instances where quoted market prices are not available  fair values are based on the quoted prices of similar instruments with adjustment for relevant distinctions 
for trading account assets  fair value is estimated giving consideration to the contractual interest rates  weighted average maturities and anticipated prepayment speeds of the underlying instruments and market interest rates 
the fair values of residual interests in loans securitized or sold are estimated through the use of a model based on prepayment speeds  weighted average life  expected credit losses and an assumed discount rate 
goodwill 
business combinations involving the company s acquisition of the equity interests or net assets of another enterprise or the assumption of net liabilities in an acquisition of branches constituting a business may give rise to goodwill 
goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the net of the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in transactions accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
the value of goodwill is ultimately derived from the company s ability to generate net earnings after the acquisition 
a decline in net earnings could be indicative of a decline in the fair value of goodwill and result in impairment 
for that reason  goodwill is assessed for impairment at a reporting unit level at least annually 
while the company believes all assumptions utilized in its assessment of goodwill for impairment are reasonable and appropriate  changes in earnings  the effective tax rate  historical earnings multiples and the cost of capital could all cause different results for the calculation of the present value of future cash flows 
financial condition compared to total assets at december  were billion  an increase of million  or  over total assets of million at december  this asset growth of million was comprised of million  or  from the acquisition of csb and acb  and the remaining was attributed to internal growth 
the company has completed six bank acquisitions since which has had a significant positive impact on its growth rate 
while management continues to examine the feasibility and financial benefit of other potential bank acquisitions  there are no assurances that such transactions will occur 
if the company does not complete additional acquisitions  its future balance sheet growth rate will be negatively effected 
since  the company has grown million in total assets  an annual compounded growth rate of approximately  to billion at december  this historical growth was approximately by acquisition and by internal growth 
included in accrued interest receivable and other assets on the consolidated balance sheet at december   is bank owned life insurance boli with a cash surrender value of  the increase of  over the cash surrender value of  at december  was primarily due to the purchase of  in new policies in connection with an officer supplemental life insurance plan 
in  the boli earned a rate of return of approximately

the company has remaining capital commitments to this partnership at december  in the amount of approximately  at december   loans were million  an increase of million or  over total loans of million at december  loan growth was the result of the acquisition of csb and acb  which contributed a combined million or of the loan growth in  continued marketing efforts and strong demand in our market area 
in addition  the company purchased approximately million in loan pools and individual loans from local banks in order to further diversify the portfolio and maximize profitability 
the company applies the same underwriting standards in loan pool purchases as it does when it originates its own loans 
while the company has benefited from operating in growing economic markets and the resulting strong loan demand  there can be no assurances that such demand will continue 
the company also operates in very competitive markets and competition may result in the loss of key employees that generate revenue as well as negatively effect the pricing of the company s products 
total deposits at december  were million  an increase of million  or  over total deposits of million at december  included in the million growth figures is million in deposits acquired in the csb and acb acquisitions  which represents of total deposit growth 
a large portion of the deposit growth occurred in non interest bearing deposits  which increased to million at december  included in these non interest bearing deposit totals are certain deposit relationships with title companies which did not have an interest cost but did have an operational cost to the company of approximately  for  which resulted in an effective cost of these deposits of approximately for now accounts increased to million and money market accounts increased to million at december  the majority of the company s deposits remain local core deposits 
at december   the company had a combined total of million in outstanding short and long term borrowings comprised of overnight federal funds advances and longer term federal home loan bank fhlb borrowings 
the balance at year end represents a million increase over the borrowings outstanding at december  these funds were borrowed primarily because of strong loan demand at year end as well as management s desire to take advantage of the historic low rates available which management believes the company will benefit from in a rising rate environment 
at december   the company had million outstanding in variable rate subordinated debentures  resulting in  in interest expense at a cost of 
total shareholders equity at december  was million  an increase of million over total shareholders equity of million at december  the increase in equity is due to an increase in retained earnings of million  an increase in common stock of million from the csb and acb acquisitions and the exercise of stock options by employees and directors  and an increase of  representing unrealized gains on available for sale securities

please see the consolidated statement of changes in shareholders equity in the consolidated financial statements for a detailed analysis of these changes 
results of operations net income 
the company recorded net income of million  or diluted earnings per share  for the year ended december  compared to net income of million  or diluted earnings per share  in and net income of million  or diluted earnings per share  in included in the results are after tax charges for merger expense of  or 
per share  amortization of core deposit intangibles of  or 
per share and a one time charge of  or 
per share to fully reserve for all historical reit benefits and any expected interest  penalties and professional costs to dissolve the reit structure 
for more discussion on the reit see income taxes below 
the increase in net income for each year above is generally attributed to increases in net interest income driven by an increase in earning assets and growth in mortgage department revenues  partially offset by an increase in the provision for loan and lease losses and operating expenses 
net interest income and net interest margin 
total interest income increased from million in to million in  and to million in  representing a increase in over and a increase in over the total interest income increases in the periods discussed were primarily the result of growth in loans and loan fee income 
on a tax equivalent basis  the company increased interest income by million in as a result of additional loan balances outstanding offset by a million reduction as a result of declining rates 
the net result was an increase of million in tax equivalent interest income 
in  the company increased interest income by million as a result of additional loan balances outstanding offset by a million reduction as a result of declining rates 
the net result was an increase of million in tax a equivalent interest income 
the loan to deposit ratio averaged for the year as compared to in and in although rates declined steadily in and  the company s yield on earning assets declined at a slower pace primarily as a result of a higher percentage of assets shifted to loans from lower yielding securities and because approximately of the company s loans as of december  were fixed or had reached contractual interest rate floors 
at december   the company s balance sheet was asset sensitive  that is  it is expected that interest margin will expand as prevailing interest rates in the marketplace increase 
while the contractual floors on loans have benefited the company as rates have declined  they will retard the expansion of the company s interest margin as rates increase  especially in the first increase in prevailing interest rates 
total interest expense decreased from million in to million in  and decreased again to million in  representing a decrease in from  and a decrease in from the decrease in interest expense in and was due to lower interest rates across all deposit types while being applied to a larger deposit base and a change in the deposit mix from higher to lower cost deposit types 
the company experienced a reduction in interest costs of approximately million in as a result of declining rates  offset in part by a million interest cost increase as a result of increased volume in deposits 
in  the company saved approximately million as a result of declining rates  offset in part by a million interest cost increase as a result of increased volume in deposits 
net interest income for  on a tax equivalent basis  increased by million or from the company s net interest margin on a fully tax equivalent basis has remained relatively stable during the past three years  initially increasing to in from in and then declining to in this stabilized margin has occurred during a time when many in the company s peer group have experienced significant compression of their margins and a resulting negative effect on net income 
the primary reasons that the company was able to stabilize its net interest margin during this challenging rate environment are an increase in the loan to deposit ratio the benefit of fixed rate loans and loans that have reached contractual interest rate floors and a greater percentage of non interest deposits to total deposits 
the following table presents  for the years indicated  the distribution of consolidated average assets  liabilities and shareholders equity  as well as the total dollar amounts of interest income from average earning assets and the resulting yields and the dollar amounts of interest expense and average interest bearing liabilities  expressed both in dollars and in rates

non interest income 
non interest income increased  or million  to million for as compared to million for non interest income for increased by million or from the million earned during the following table describes the components of non interest income for the years ended december   and dollars in thousands 
non interest income of gross revenue year ended december  income of avg assets income of avg assets income of avg assets service charges gain on sale and packaging of loans gain on sale and call of investment securities  net other income total the increase in non interest income in from and was primarily from increases in the gain on sale and packaging of loans as a result of an improved market for home mortgages due to decreasing interest rates 
the company s mortgage banking activities contributed approximately   and  in  and  respectively  to pretax income after allocation of interest and administrative costs incurred to support the mortgage group s activities 
while the company s mortgage activities have benefited from historically low interest rates  if interest rates where to rise significantly it would have a negative effect on the refinancing activities  which currently comprise of its mortgage business 
the company obtained approximately of its mortgage business from purchase transactions which management expects will not be as exposed in a future cycle of increasing interest rates 
service charges also increased significantly primarily as a result of adding new accounts both organically and through the acquisition of three banks ccb  csb  and acb in and non interest expense 
non interest expense amounted to million in  million in and million in this represents an increase of million  or  in over and an increase of million  or  in when compared to the primary reason for the increase in operating expenses in vs 
is the acquisition of three bank subsidiaries and the resulting cost structure that remained after the accounting  loan administration  compliance  data processing and human resource functions were folded into the company s holding company structure 
the company s primary measure of its cost containment strategies is the efficiency ratio total operating expense divided by total tax adjusted revenue  which is a standard measure in the banking industry 
the efficiency ratio is effectively the cost of generating in net revenue net interest income plus other income 
in  it cost the company approximately to generate in net revenue 
as the company leveraged its cost structure and managed expense growth to a rate slower than growth in net interest income  the company s efficiency ratio has improved from in to in and in the company continues to believe that to be able to compete in the current environment of decreasing interest margins and increased competition  the controlling of operating expenses is essential 
the consolidation of many administrative functions such as purchasing  human resources  advertising  accounting  treasury and data processing are essential in successfully deploying a multi bank holding company business model 
management continues to closely monitor this area 
salaries and benefits have continued to increase due primarily to mortgage commissions  incentives and the addition of acb  csb and ccb personnel 
mortgage commissions increased in to million from million in incentives paid primarily for loan production and officer performance increased in to million from million in the increase in related revenues more than compensates for increases in mortgage commissions and employee incentives 
professional fees decreased by  in versus in  the company had expenditures of approximately  to establish the real estate investment trust as a subsidiary of western sierra national bank 
for further discussion  see income taxes below 
data processing fees increased significantly in due to the write down of approximately  for certain equipment that was retired as part of a system upgrade and management s decision to outsource its primary data and item processing functions in the third quarter of data processing expense was flat in despite the company s growth as the investment made in prior periods was leveraged more effectively 
in  other operating expenses increased  over due to the acquisition of three banks ccb  csb  and acb in and management expects that all non interest expense categories will increase in because csb and acb were not included in the results of operations for all of the following table describes the components of other non interest expense as a percentage of average assets for the years ended december   and dollars in thousands 
non interest expense of gross revenue year ended december  expense of avg assets expense of avg assets expense of avg assets salaries and benefits occupancy ff e merger expenses professional fees data processing stationery and supplies advertising promotion insurance other operating expense total provision for loan and lease losses 
the provision for loan and lease losses corresponds directly to the level of the allowance that management deems sufficient to offset potential losses 
the balance in the allowance reflects the amount which  in management s judgment  is adequate to provide for these potential losses after weighing the mix of the loan and lease portfolio  current economic conditions  past loan experience and such other factors as deserve recognition in estimating loan and lease losses 
management allocated  as a provision for loan and lease losses in   in and  in loan charge offs  net of recoveries  were  in   in and  in the ratio of net loan charge offs to average gross loans and leases was in  in and in the ratio of the allowance for loan and lease losses to total gross loans and leases was in  in  and in in determining the provision for each of the last three years and the resulting loan loss reserve ratio to gross loans and leases  management considered  among other factors  loan and lease loss experience  current economic conditions  maturity of the portfolio  size of the portfolio  industry concentrations  borrower credit history  the existing allowance for loan and lease losses  independent loan and lease reviews  current charges to and recoveries within the allowance for loan and lease losses and the overall quality of the portfolio as determined by management  regulatory agencies  and independent credit review consultants retained by the company 
in management s opinion  the allowance for loan and lease losses at december  was sufficient to sustain any foreseeable losses in the loan and lease portfolio at that time 
however  no assurances can be given that the company will not sustain substantially higher loan and lease losses 
income taxes 
income taxes were million in  million in and million in  representing effective tax rates of  and  respectively 
the company s effective tax rate varies with changes in the relative amounts of its non taxable income and non deductible expenses 
the company s tax provision is also affected by increases in the company s net income in comparison to the relative amount of tax exempt income 
the company decreased its effective tax rate in by deploying a series of tax strategies including the purchase of tax exempt municipal bonds  the funding of enterprise zone loans and the establishment of a real estate investment trust reit at western sierra national bank in the first quarter of the company recognized approximately  in tax benefits  offset in part by approximately  on an after tax basis in professional fees  on its december  financial statements in connection with the reit 
the company s tax rate increased to in vs 
in as a  charge was taken to tax expense in december had this charge not been taken  the company s tax rate would have been approximately 
in early  the company s management decided not to recognize any additional california state tax benefits associated with the reit until there was more clarity as to california s position on the application of state tax laws with respect to the reit 
as a result of management s decision not to recognize any benefit in  no change to taxes accrued for earnings generated in was required 
the chief counsel of the franchise tax board  in an announcement released on december   declared the position of the franchise tax board with respect to certain reit transactions 
as a result of that announcement  and after conferring with two independent tax experts  management made the decision to i fully reserve for all state tax benefits previously recognized in in connection with the reit and ii establish appropriate reserves for related potential costs 
the accrual for this reserve resulted in a reduction in earnings of approximately  or 
per share 
the company is not under examination by any taxing authority for this or any other issue 
the company will remit all taxes due to the state and continue to monitor developments concerning the reit 
the company reserves its right to appeal this issue and claim a refund of payments made if the matter is favorably resolved in the future

a funds management policy has been developed by the company s management  and approved by the company s board of directors  which establishes guidelines for the investments and liquidity of the company 
the goals of this policy are to provide liquidity to meet the financial requirements of the customers  maintain adequate reserves as required by regulatory agencies and maximize earnings 
liquidity at december  was  at december  was and at december  was based on liquid assets consisting of cash and due from banks  investments not pledged  federal funds sold and loans available for sale divided by total liabilities 
in addition  the company substantially increased its borrowing capacity from its correspondent banks in at december   the aggregate consolidated unused borrowing capacity of each subsidiary bank and of the company was approximately million 
management believes it maintains adequate liquidity levels 
investment portfolio 
the company classifies its investment securities as trading  held to maturity or available for sale 
the company s intent is to hold all securities classified as held to maturity until maturity and management believes that it has the ability to do so 
securities available for sale may be sold to implement asset liability management strategies and in response to changes in interest rates  prepayment rates and similar factors 
the following table summarizes the maturities of investment securities  their carrying value and their weighted average yields at december  excluded categories are those that are not due at a single maturity date  including government guaranteed mortgage backed securities  sba loan pools  and stocks

the allowance for loan and lease losses totaled million  equaling of loans and leases outstanding  compared to million  or  a year ago 
the company s largest historical lending categories are real estate secured and commercial loans 
these categories accounted for approximately and  respectively  of the total loan portfolio at december   and approximately and  respectively  of the total loan portfolio at december  loans are carried at face amount  less payments collected and the allowance for possible loan and lease losses 
interest on all loans and leases is accrued monthly on a simple interest basis 
typically  once a loan or lease is placed on non accrual status  the company reverses interest accrued through the date of the transfer 
loans and leases are placed on non accrual status when principal or interest on a loan or lease is past due days or more  unless the loan or lease is both well secured and in the process of collection 
interest actually received for loans and leases on non accrual status is recognized as income at the time of receipt for loans and leases for which the ultimate collectibility of principal is not in doubt 
problem loans are maintained on accrual status only when management is confident of full repayment within a reasonable period of time 
the rates of interest charged on variable rate loans are set at specific increments in relation to the company s published lending rate and vary as the company s lending rate varies 
at december  and  approximately and  respectively  of the loan portfolio was comprised of variable rate loans that were not at contractual floors 
the following table sets forth the amounts of loans outstanding by category as of the dates indicated dollars in thousands 
december  balance of total balance of total balance of total balance of total balance of total real estate mortgage real estate construction commercial lease financing installment agriculture less deferred fees total loans less provision for loan and lease losses net loans real estate loans 
real estate loans are primarily made for the purpose of purchasing  refinancing  improving or constructing family residences as well as commercial and industrial properties 
at december   million of the company s commercial real estate construction loans consisted of loans secured by first trust deeds on the construction of speculative commercial buildings and the remaining million consisted of loans secured by first trust deeds on the construction of owner occupied commercial buildings 
the minimum loan to appraised value is generally for conforming real estate loans  for construction  for nonconforming real estate and for commercial real estate loans 
construction loans are generally written with terms of to months 
the risks associated with speculative construction lending include the borrower s inability to complete the construction process on time and within budget  the leasing of the project at projected lease rates within projected absorption periods  the economic risks associated with real estate collateral  and the potential of a rising interest rate environment 
management has established underwriting and monitoring criteria to minimize the inherent risks of speculative commercial real estate construction lending 
further  management concentrates lending efforts with developers demonstrating successful performance on marketable projects within the company s lending areas 
to date  the company has not suffered any significant losses through its speculative commercial real estate construction loans 
at december   approximately million of the company s single family real estate construction loans consisted of loans secured by first trust deeds on the construction of speculative single family dwellings and the remaining million consisted of loans secured by first trust deeds on the construction of owner occupied single family dwellings 
construction loans are generally written with terms of six to twelve months and usually do not exceed a loan to appraised value ratio of to 
the risk associated with speculative construction lending includes the borrower s inability to complete and sell the project  the borrower s incorrect estimate of necessary construction funds and or time for completion and economic changes  including depressed real estate values and increased interest rates 
management has established underwriting criteria to minimize losses on speculative construction loans by lending only to experienced developers and contractors with proven track records 
to date the company has not suffered any significant losses through its speculative single family real estate construction loans 
commercial loans 
commercial loans are made for the purpose of providing working capital  financing the purchase of equipment or inventory and for other business purposes 
such loans include loans with maturities ranging from to days and term loans  which are loans with maturities normally ranging from one to five years 
short term business loans are generally used to finance current transactions and typically provide for periodic interest payments  with principal payable at maturity or periodically 
term loans normally provide for monthly payments of both principal and interest 
the company extends lines of credit to business customers 
on business credit lines  the company specifies a maximum amount that it stands ready to lend to the customer during a specified period in return for which the customer agrees to maintain its primary banking relationship with the company 
the purpose for which such loans will be used and the security pledged  if any  are determined before the commitment is extended 
normally the company does not make credit line commitments in material amounts for periods in excess of one year 
mortgage loans 
mortgage loans are generated by the company s mortgage division for the purpose of resale in the secondary market 
the loans are fannie mae and freddie mac conforming product and are sold by the company without retaining servicing rights 
purchase transactions accounted for approximately of dollars funded in  with the balance refinance transactions 
management expects rising rates would have a negative effect on the mortgage division s volume  especially in refinance activity 
sales generated million in fees to the company in loan commitments 
in the normal course of business  there are various commitments outstanding to extend credit that are not reflected in the financial statements 
annual review of commercial credit lines and ongoing monitoring of outstanding balances reduces the risk of loss associated with these commitments 
as of december   the company had million in unfunded commercial real estate loan commitments that are secured by real estate and million in unfunded commercial commitments that are secured by collateral other than real estate or are unsecured 
in addition  the company had million in other unused commitments 
the company s undisbursed commercial loan commitments represent primarily business lines of credit 
the undisbursed construction commitments represent undisbursed funding on construction projects in process 
mortgage loan commitments represent approved but unfunded mortgage loans in connection with the company s mortgage banking business 
based upon prior experience and prevailing economic conditions  it is anticipated that approximately of the commitments at december  will be exercised during maturity distribution 
the following table sets forth the maturity of certain loan categories as of december  excluded categories are residential mortgages of family residences  personal installment loans and lease financing 
also provided with respect to included loans are the amounts due after one year  classified according to sensitivity to changes in interest rates dollars in thousands 
within one year after one through five years after five years total commercial and agricultural real estate construction total loans maturing after one year with fixed interest rates variable interest rates total real estate construction loans maturing after one year are made up of construction and mini perm loans 
the construction phase of these loans generally runs from to months 
asset quality 
the company attempts to minimize credit risk through its underwriting and credit review policies 
the company conducts its own internal credit review processes 
the board of directors  through the loan committee  reviews the asset quality of new and problem loans and leases on a monthly basis and reports the findings to the full board of directors 
in management s opinion  this loan review system facilitates the early identification of potential problem loans and leases 
the company places loans and leases days or more past due on non accrual status unless the loan or lease is well secured and in the process of collection 
a loan or lease is considered to be in the process of collection if  based on a probable specific event  it is expected that the loan will be repaid or brought current 
generally  this collection period would not exceed days 
when a loan or lease is placed on non accrual status  the company s general policy is to reverse and charge against current income previously accrued but unpaid interest 
interest income on such loans and leases is subsequently recognized only to the extent that cash is received and future collection of principal is deemed by management to be probable 
where the collectibility of the principal or interest on a loan or lease is considered to be doubtful by management  it is placed on non accrual status prior to becoming days delinquent 
interest income is recognized on impaired loans and leases in a manner similar to that of the rest of the portfolio 
it is the company s policy to place impaired loans and leases that are delinquent days or more as to principal or interest on non accrual status unless secured and in the process of collection and to reverse from current income accrued but uncollected interest 
cash payments subsequently received on non accrual loans and leases are recognized as income only where the future collection of principal is considered by management to be probable

loan and lease losses are charged to  and recoveries are credited to  the allowance for loan and lease losses 
the provision for loan and lease losses is determined after considering various factors such as loan and lease loss experience  current economic conditions  maturity of the portfolio  size of the portfolio  industry concentrations  borrower credit history  the existing allowance for loan and lease losses  independent loan reviews  current charges to and recoveries within the allowance for loan and lease losses and the overall quality of the portfolio as determined by management  regulatory agencies  and independent credit review consultants retained by the company 
the adequacy of the company s allowance for loan and lease losses is based on specific and formula allocations to the company s loan and lease portfolio 
specific allocations are made for impaired loans and leases 
the specific allocations are increased or decreased through management s reevaluation of the status of the particular problem loans and leases 
loans and leases which do not receive a specific allocation receive an allowance allocation based on a formula represented by a percentage factor based on underlying collateral  type of loan and lease  historical charge offs and general economic conditions which is applied against the general portfolio segments 
it is the policy of management to make additions to the allowance for loan and lease losses so that it remains adequate to cover anticipated charge offs and management believes that the allowance at december  is adequate 
however  the determination of the amount of the allowance is judgmental and subject to economic conditions which cannot be predicted with certainty 
accordingly  the company cannot predict whether charge offs of loans and leases in excess of the allowance may be required in future periods 
the provision for loan and lease losses reflects an accrual sufficient to cover projected potential charge offs 
the table below sets forth the allocation of the allowance for loan and lease losses by loan type as of the dates specified 
the allocation of individual categories of loans includes amounts applicable to specifically identified  as well as unidentified  losses inherent in that segment of the loan and lease portfolio and will necessarily change whenever management determines that the risk characteristics of the loan portfolio have changed 
management believes that any breakdown or allocation of the allowance for loan and lease losses into loan categories lends an appearance of exactness which does not exist  in that the allowance is utilized as a single unallocated allowance available for all loans and undisbursed commitments 
the allocation below should not be interpreted as an indication of the specific amounts or loan categories in which future charge offs may occur dollars in thousands year ended december allowance for losses of loans allowance for losses of loans allowance for losses of loans allowance for losses of loans allowance for losses of loans real estate mortgage real estate construction commercial lease financing installment and other agriculture unallocated total deposit structure 
deposits represent the company s primary source of funds 
deposits are primarily core deposits in that they are demand  savings and time deposits generated from local businesses and individuals 
these sources are considered to be relatively stable  long term relationships thereby enhancing steady growth of the deposit base without major fluctuations in overall deposit balances 
the company has experienced some seasonality  with the slower growth period from november through april and the higher growth period from may through october 
in order to assist in meeting any funding demands  the company maintains unsecured borrowing arrangements with several correspondent banks in addition to a secured borrowing arrangement with the federal home loan bank for longer more permanent funding needs 
the unused borrowing capacity of the company was approximately million and million at december  and respectively

the potential impact on the company s liquidity from the withdrawal of these deposits is discussed in the company s asset and liability management committee and is considered to be minimal 
off balance sheet items the company has certain ongoing commitments under operating leases 
see note to the consolidated financial statements at item of this report for the terms 
these commitments do not significantly impact operating results

item a 
quantitative qualitative disclosure about market risk as a financial institution  the company s primary market risk is interest rate volatility 
fluctuation in interest rates will ultimately impact both the level of income and expense recorded on a large portion of the company s assets and liabilities and the market value of all interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  other than those which possess a short term to maturity 
since virtually all of the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities are located at the bank level  all significant interest rate risk management procedures are performed at this level 
based upon the nature of their operations  the banks are not subject to foreign currency exchange or commodity price risk 
the banks real estate loan portfolios  concentrated primarily within northern california  are subject to risks associated with the local economies 
the fundamental objective of the company s management of its assets and liabilities is to maximize the economic value of the company while maintaining adequate liquidity and an exposure to interest rate risk deemed by management to be acceptable 
management believes an acceptable degree of exposure to interest rate risk results from the management of assets and liabilities through maturities  pricing and mix to attempt to neutralize the potential impact of changes in market interest rates 
the banks profitability is dependent to a large extent upon their net interest income  which is the difference between their interest income on interest earning assets  such as loans and securities  and their interest expense on interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits and borrowings 
the banks  like other financial institutions  are subject to interest rate risk to the degree that their interest earning assets reprice differently than their interest bearing liabilities 
the banks manage their mix of assets and liabilities with the goals of limiting their exposure to interest rate risk  ensuring adequate liquidity  and coordinating their sources and uses of funds 
the banks seek to control their interest rate risk exposure in a manner that will allow for adequate levels of earnings and capital over a range of possible interest rate environments 
the banks have adopted formal policies and practices to monitor and manage interest rate risk exposure 
as part of this effort  the banks measure interest rate risk utilizing both an internal model and third party sources  which can be compared to each other  enabling management to make any adjustments as necessary 
the following table sets forth  as of december   the distribution of repricing opportunities for the company s earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the interest rate sensitivity gap  the cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap  the interest rate sensitivity gap ratio ie earning assets divided by interest bearing liabilities and the cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap ratio dollars in thousands 
within three months after three months but within one year after one year but within five years after five years total earning assets federal funds sold investment securities and other loans total earning assets interest bearing liabilities savings interest bearing transaction accounts time deposits subordinated debentures other borrowings total interest bearing liabilities interest rate sensitivity gap cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap interest rate sensitivity gap ratio cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap ratio the opportunity to reprice assets in the same dollar amounts and at the same time as liabilities would minimize interest rate risk in any interest rate environment 
the difference between the amounts of assets and liabilities repriced at the same time  or gap  represents the risk  or opportunity  in repricing 
in general  if more assets than liabilities are repriced at a given time in a rising rate environment  net interest income would improve while in a declining rate environment net interest income would decline 
if more liabilities than assets were repriced under the same conditions the opposite would result 
the company appears liability sensitive in the immediate to six month timeframe  and turns asset sensitive in the longer term 
this can be  and is  influenced by the fact that interest bearing transaction accounts which consist of money market  now and savings deposit accounts are classified as repricing within three months when in fact these deposits may be immediately repriced at management s option  thus assisting in the further management of interest rate risk 
the company lists these deposits as it has because this is the actual historical trend the company has experienced 
the company s net interest margin on a fully tax equivalent basis has remained stable overall during the past three years  initially increasing to in from in and then declining to in the company deployed an interest rate risk measurement tool in that measures the sensitivity of every major asset and liability category on an individual basis to appropriately model the expected effect of changes in interest rates on these financial instruments 
the output of this model indicates that the company s balance sheet as of december  is asset sensitive  that is it will grow net interest income and interest margin as rates move up and will experience a decline in net interest income and margin if rates were to fall 
management believes that longer term municipal bonds  fixed rate loans  and loans at contractual floors have benefited the company s interest margin over the last three years as market rates of interest have fallen and the yields on these assets have not been as affected as instruments that move freely with changes in interest rates 
the company estimates that approximately million or of it s loan portfolio are variable rate loans that have reached a contractual floor  approximately are fixed rate loans and the remaining are variable rate loans that will move freely with changes in the associated index rate 
while the company is asset sensitive  the loans at contractual floors temper that sensitivity in the early stages of an increasing rate cycle 
management estimates that approximately million of these loans will come off their floor after a rise and another million will come off their floor if rates move an additional 
management believes that the company is well positioned given that it has a relatively strong interest margin and is asset sensitive at what management believes to be the bottom of an interest rate cycle 
the following tables  in management s opinion  reflect estimates of the company s future net interest income under different interest rate scenarios 
the net interest income estimates are one year projections based on the earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as of december  the estimates are derived from an asset liability management model deployed in there are numerous underlying assumptions that management believes are accurate  but if they are inaccurate could have an impact to the results of operations 
under the shock scenarios  the changes to interest rates are assumed to occur immediately on january  
under the ramp scenarios the changes to interest rates gradually ramp up or down over the coarse of one year dollars in thousands 
shock scenario change in interest rates estimated net interest income dollar change from base percentage change from base basis point rise basis point rise basis point rise basis point rise base scenario basis point decline basis point decline ramp scenario change in interest rates estimated net interest income dollar change from base percentage change from base basis point rise basis point rise basis point rise basis point rise base scenario basis point decline basis point decline these tables do not show a basis point decline because the federal funds rate at december  was and it cannot decline below 
capital standards 
the federal banking agencies have risk based capital adequacy guidelines intended to provide a measure of capital adequacy that reflects the degree of risk associated with a banking organization s operations for both transactions reported on the balance sheet as assets and transactions  such as letters of credit and recourse arrangements  which are recorded as off balance sheet items 
under these guidelines  nominal dollar amounts of assets and credit equivalent amounts of off balance sheet items are multiplied by one of several risk adjustment percentages  which range from for assets with low credit risk  such as certain us government securities  to for assets with relatively higher credit risk  such as certain loans 
as of december   the company s and its subsidiary banks capital ratios exceeded applicable minimum regulatory requirements 
the following tables present the capital ratios for the company and the banks compared to the standards for bank holding companies and well capitalized depository institutions as of december  amounts in thousands except percentage amounts

the company s policy is to maintain ratios above the prescribed well capitalized ratios at all times 
shareholders equity 
the shareholders equity of the company increased from million at december  to million at december  and to million at december  these increases are attributable to retained earnings  the exercise of stock options  stock issued in acquisitions and adjustments for unrealized gains and losses on available for sale investment securities offset in part by stock repurchases by the company 
the company is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies 
under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  the company must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets  liabilities and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators regarding components  risk weighting and other factors
