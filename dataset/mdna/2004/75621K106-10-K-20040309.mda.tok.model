item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the historical financial statements of reckson associates realty corp 
the company and related notes thereto 
the company considers certain statements set forth herein to be forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  with respect to the company s expectations for future periods 
certain forward looking statements  including  without limitation  statements relating to the timing and success of acquisitions and the completion of development or redevelopment of properties  the financing of the company s operations  the ability to lease vacant space and the ability to renew or relet space under expiring leases  involve risks and uncertainties 
many of the forward looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as believes  may  expects  anticipates  intends or similar expressions 
although the company believes that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions  the actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward looking statements and the company can give no assurance that its expectation will be achieved 
among those risks  trends and uncertainties are the general economic climate  including the conditions affecting industries in which our principal tenants compete  changes in the supply of and demand for office in the new york tri state area  changes in interest rate levels  changes in the company s credit ratings  changes in the company s cost and access to capital  downturns in rental rate levels in our markets and our ability to lease or re lease space in a timely manner at current or anticipated rental rate levels  the availability of financing to us or our tenants  financial condition of our tenants  changes in operating costs  including utility  security  real estate tax and insurance costs  repayment of debt owed to the company by third parties including frontline capital group  risks associated with joint ventures  liability for uninsured losses or environmental matters  and other risks associated with the development and acquisition of properties  including risks that development may not be completed on schedule  that the tenants will not take occupancy or pay rent  or that development or operating costs may be greater than anticipated 
consequently  such forward looking statements should be regarded solely as reflections of the company s current operating and development plans and estimates 
these plans and estimates are subject to revisions from time to time as additional information becomes available  and actual results may differ from those indicated in the referenced statements 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements of the company include accounts of the company and all majority owned and controlled subsidiaries 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the company s consolidated financial statements and related notes 
in preparing these financial statements  management has utilized information available including its past history  industry standards and the current economic environment  among other factors  in forming its estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the consolidated financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
it is possible that the ultimate outcome as anticipated by management in formulating its estimates inherent in these financial statements may not materialize 
however  application of the critical accounting policies below involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
in addition  other companies may utilize different estimates  which may impact comparability of the company s results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable minimum rental revenue is recognized on a straight line basis  which averages minimum rents over the terms of the leases 
the excess of rents recognized over amounts contractually due are included in deferred rents receivable on the company s balance sheets 
the leases also typically provide for tenant reimbursements of common area maintenance and other operating expenses and real estate taxes 
ancillary and other property related income is recognized in the period earned 
the company makes estimates of the collectibility of its accounts receivables related to base rents  tenant escalations and reimbursements and other revenue or income 
the company specifically analyzes tenant receivables and analyzes historical bad debts  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of its allowance for doubtful accounts 
in addition  when tenants are in bankruptcy the company makes estimates of the expected recovery of pre petition administrative and damage claims 
in some cases  the ultimate resolution of those claims can exceed a year 
these estimates have a direct impact on the company s net income  because a higher bad debt reserve results in less net income 
the company incurred approximately million and million of bad debt expense for the years ended december  and  respectively  related to tenant receivables and deferred rents receivable which accordingly reduced total revenues and reported net income during the period 
the company records interest income on investments in mortgage notes and notes receivable on an accrual basis of accounting 
the company does not accrue interest on impaired loans where  in the judgment of management  collection of interest according to the contractual terms is considered doubtful 
among the factors the company considers in making an evaluation of the collectibility of interest are i the status of the loan  ii the value of the underlying collateral  iii the financial condition of the borrower and iv anticipated future events 
reckson construction group  inc  reckson construction and development llc  the successor to reckson construction group  inc  and reckson construction group new york  inc use the percentage of completion method for recording amounts earned on their contracts 
this method records amounts earned as revenue in the proportion that actual costs incurred to date bear to the estimate of total costs at contract completion 
gain on sales of real estate are recorded when title is conveyed to the buyer  subject to the buyer s financial commitment being sufficient to provide economic substance to the sale and the company having no substantial continuing involvement with the buyer 
the company follows the guidance provided for under the financing accounting standards board fasb statement no 
accounting for sales of real estate statement no 
 which provides guidance on sales contracts that are accompanied by agreements which require the seller to develop the property in the future 
under statement no 
profit is recognized and allocated to the sale of the land and the later development or construction work on the basis of estimated costs of each activity  the same rate of profit is attributed to each activity 
as a result  profits are recognized and reflected over the improvement period on the basis of costs incurred including land as a percentage of total costs estimated to be incurred 
the company uses the percentage of completion method  as future costs of development and profit are reliably estimated 
real estate land  buildings and improvements  furniture  fixtures and equipment are recorded at cost 
tenant improvements  which are included in buildings and improvements  are also stated at cost 
expenditures for ordinary maintenance and repairs are expensed to operations as they are incurred 
renovations and or replacements  which improve or extend the life of the asset  are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives 
depreciation is computed utilizing the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of ten to thirty years for buildings and improvements and five to ten years for furniture  fixtures and equipment 
tenant improvements are amortized on a straight line basis over the term of the related leases 
the company is required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of its properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to reflect on an annual basis with respect to those properties 
these assessments have a direct impact on the company s net income 
should the company lengthen the expected useful life of a particular asset  it would be depreciated over more years  and result in less depreciation expense and higher annual net income 
assessment by the company of certain other lease related costs must be made when the company has a reason to believe that the tenant will not be able to execute under the term of the lease as originally expected 
on july  and january   the company adopted fasb statement no

as part of the acquisition of real estate assets  the fair value of the real estate acquired is allocated to the acquired tangible assets  consisting of land  building and building improvements  and identified intangible assets and liabilities  consisting of the value of above market and below market leases  other value of in place leases  and value of tenant relationships  based in each case on their fair values 
the company assesses fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and capitalization rates and available market information 
estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results  known trends  and market economic conditions that may affect the property 
if the company incorrectly estimates the values at acquisition or the undiscounted cash flows  initial allocation of purchase price and future impairment charges may be different 
long lived assets on a periodic basis  management assesses whether there are any indicators that the value of the real estate properties may be impaired 
a property s value is impaired only if management s estimate of the aggregate future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges to be generated by the property are less than the carrying value of the property 
such cash flows consider factors such as expected future operating income  trends and prospects  as well as the effects of demand  competition and other factors 
to the extent impairment has occurred  the loss will be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the property over the fair value of the property 
the company is required to make subjective assessments as to whether there are impairments in the value of its real estate properties and other investments 
these assessments have a direct impact on the company s net income  because taking an impairment results in an immediate negative adjustment to net income

the two largest properties are covered for up to million on such policies and are covered under separate policies  which include coverage for acts of terrorism  up to the estimated replacement cost for these properties 
the impact of the terrorist attacks of september   in new york city may adversely effect the value of the company s new york city properties and its ability to generate cash flow

off balance sheet arrangements the company has no off balance sheet arrangements except for its non controlling interest in the jv and its joint venture interest in rsvp 
for a more detailed description of these arrangements see overview and background of this item inflation the office leases generally provide for fixed base rent increases or indexed escalations 
in addition  the office leases provide for separate escalations of real estate taxes  operating expenses and electric costs over a base amount 
the industrial r d leases generally provide for fixed base rent increases  direct pass through of certain operating expenses and separate real estate tax escalations over a base amount 
the company believes that inflationary increases in expenses will be mitigated by contractual rent increases and expense escalations described above 
as a result of the impact of the events of september   the company has realized increased insurance costs  particularly relating to property and terrorism insurance  and security costs 
the company has included these costs as part of its escalatable expenses and has billed them to its tenants consistent with the terms of the underlying leases 
to the extent the company s properties contain vacant space  the company will bear such inflationary increases in expenses 
the credit facility bears interest at a variable rate  which will be influenced by changes in short term interest rates  and is sensitive to inflation 
funds from operations management believes that funds from operations ffo is an appropriate measure of performance of an equity reit 
although ffo is a non gaap measure  the company believes it provides useful information to its shareholders  potential investors and management 
the company computes ffo in accordance with the standards established by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit as net income or loss  excluding gains or losses from sales of depreciable properties plus real estate depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and is not indicative of cash available to fund cash needs 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of the company s operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity 
see selected financial data 
ffo for the year ended december  includes a gain from the sale of land and build to suit transaction in the amount of million 
for the years ended december  and  pursuant to the company s adoption of fasb statement no 
 which addresses reporting for gains and losses from extinguishment of debt  the company has reduced previously reported ffo by approximately million and million  respectively  related to the write off of certain deferred loan costs incurred in connection with the company s refinancing of its debt 
these costs were previously recorded as an extraordinary loss and therefore excluded from the company s calculation of ffo 
in addition  ffo for the year ended december  excludes million of valuation reserves on investments in affiliate loans and joint ventures 
since all companies and analysts do not calculate ffo in a similar fashion  the company s calculation of ffo presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures as reported by other companies

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary market risk facing the company is interest rate risk on its long term debt  mortgage notes and notes receivable 
the company will  when advantageous  hedge its interest rate risk using financial instruments 
the company is not subject to foreign currency risk 
the company manages its exposure to interest rate risk on its variable rate indebtedness by borrowing on a short term basis under its credit facility until such time as it is able to retire the short term variable rate debt with either a long term fixed rate debt offering  long term mortgage debt  equity offerings or through sales or partial sales of assets 
the company will recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value 
derivatives that are not hedges will be adjusted to fair value through income 
if a derivative is a hedge  depending on the nature of the hedge  changes in the fair value of the derivative will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged asset  liability or firm commitment through earnings  or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
the ineffective portion of a derivative s change in fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings 
as of december   the company had certain derivatives outstanding related to the company s january issuance of senior unsecured notes 
at december  the fair value of these instruments reasonably approximated their carrying value
