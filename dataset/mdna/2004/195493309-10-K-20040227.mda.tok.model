critical accounting policies bancgroup s significant accounting policies are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
these policies  along with the disclosures presented in the other footnotes  provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined 
those accounting policies involving significant estimates and assumptions by management  which have  or could have  a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and impact comprehensive income  are considered critical accounting policies 
bancgroup recognizes the following as critical accounting policies allowance for loan losses and goodwill impairment analysis 
allowance for loan losses 
management s ongoing evaluation of the adequacy and allocation of the allowance considers both impaired and unimpaired loans and takes into consideration the bank s past loan loss experience  known and inherent risks in the portfolio  adverse situations that may affect the borrowers ability to repay  estimated value of any underlying collateral  the reviews of regulators  and an analysis of current economic conditions 
while management believes that it has exercised prudent judgment and applied reasonable assumptions which have resulted in an allowance presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  there can be no assurance that in the future  adverse economic conditions  increased nonperforming loans  regulatory concerns  or other factors will not require further increases in  or re allocation of the allowance 
a more detailed discussion of bancgroup s allowance for loan losses is included in the respective section of management s discussion and analysis and note to the consolidated financial statements 
the table below illustrates bancgroup s sensitivity to changes in certain factors used in the determination of the allowance for loan losses 
estimated effect on provision expense assuming the following changes in each determining factor factors in thousands loan portfolio size net charge offs criticized loans no effect on provision expense is estimated for a decrease in charge offs because the allowance methodology is heavily influenced by higher charge off years 
criticized loans include all loans rated special mention or worse includes all nonperforming assets and severely past due loans 
no effect on provision expense is estimated for a increase in criticized loans because the unallocated reserve would cover the increase 
these computations do not contemplate any action bancgroup could undertake in response to changes in each of these risk factors 
goodwill impairment analysis 
goodwill represents the excess of the cost of the acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired 
bancgroup tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis  or more often if events or circumstances indicate that there may be impairment 
the company has elected to perform its annual testing as of september each year 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step process  which requires management to make judgments in determining the assumptions used in the calculations 
the first step involves estimating the fair value of each reporting unit and comparing it to the reporting unit s carrying value  which includes the allocated goodwill 
if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value  then a second step is performed to measure the actual amount of goodwill impairment 
the second step first involves determining the implied fair value of goodwill 
this requires the company to allocate the estimated fair value to all the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit 
any unallocated fair value represents the implied fair value of goodwill which is compared to its corresponding carrying value 
if the carrying value exceeds the implied fair value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
fair values of reporting units were estimated using discounted cash flow models derived from internal earnings forecasts 
the key assumptions used to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit included earnings forecasts for years  terminal values based on future growth rates and discount rates based on the company s weighted average cost of capital adjusted for the risks associated with the operations of each reporting unit 
the goodwill impairment analysis for indicated that no impairment write offs were required 
the table below illustrates bancgroup s sensitivity to changes in the rates used in discounting the estimated future cash flows 
the sensitivity analysis was based on information available as of the annual test date of september  further discussion regarding bancgroup s accounting for goodwill is included at note to the consolidated financial statements 
sensitivity of goodwill impairment analysis results assuming the following changes in discount rates no change in thousands total excess of estimated fair value versus carrying value for all reporting units these computations do not take into account changes in the forecasted cash flows and future annual growth rates 
further  the computations do not contemplate any action bancgroup could undertake in response to changes in the risks associated with the operations of each reporting unit 
under these computations  the company would anticipate no material impairment

net interest income net interest income on a tax equivalent basis increased or million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the principal factor affecting net interest income in was an increase in earning assets offset partially by a decline in the net interest margin 
average interest earning assets average interest earning assets grew billion and billion in and  respectively 
the average rate on earning assets declined and basis points in and  respectively 
the decline in the earning asset yield was due to overall market rate declines and the change in mix of earning assets 
the composition of the earning asset growth is detailed in the sections below 
loans 
average total loans grew billion or in over and million or in over  the mortgage warehouse lending portfolio accounted for million and million of the increase for the same periods  respectively 
mortgage warehouse lending is a centralized division that provides lines of credit collateralized by residential mortgage loans to mortgage origination companies 
the record low mortgage rates available in and then again in resulted in large increases in average loans for this division as overall mortgage activity  both refinancings and purchases  reached record levels 
the mortgage warehouse portfolio has grown as a percent of average total loans from in to in these lines reprice daily and therefore the average rate on this portfolio declined basis points to in versus in the average balance of loans excluding mortgage warehouse lending also showed significant growth rising million or  a much faster pace than the average increase in of million or 
the average rate on the loan portfolio excluding the mortgage warehouse division was for  compared to for this decline was due to a basis point mid year decrease in the prime rate as well as an adjustment of fixed rate loans due to the market rate declines of and mortgage loans held for sale 
mortgage loans held for sale represent single family residential mortgage loans either directly originated  or acquired as short term participations in pools of mortgage loans 
it is the company s policy to enter into forward sales commitments at the same time these mortgage loans are originated or acquired 
the level and direction of long term interest rates have a dramatic impact on the volume of mortgage loan originations from new construction and refinancings 
as a result of decreasing mortgage interest rates  average mortgage loans held for sale increased to million in from million in and million in despite lower mortgage rates  the average rate on the company s mortgage loans held for sale increased basis points to in versus the increase was due to higher yielding short term participations in pools of mortgage loans representing a larger percentage of the average balance 
securities 
on average the securities portfolio increased to billion in from billion in and billion in securities comprised of average earning assets in compared to and in and  respectively 
selectively purchasing intermediate term securities has enabled bancgroup to take advantage of attractive interest rate spreads to short term funding cost while maintaining a relatively neutral interest rate sensitivity position 
the average yield declined to in from and in and  respectively 
this decline was due in part to low mortgage rates that accelerated prepayments in the portfolio and increased the premium amortization recognition for these investments 
additionally  both the growth in the portfolio and the reinvestment due to accelerated repayments were invested in lower yielding securities  as a result of current market rates  adding downward pressure on the securities yield in and average interest bearing liabilities the average cost of interest bearing liabilities decreased basis points to in  compared to in and in the lower average cost of funds in and was primarily the result of a shift in deposit mix to non time deposits from time deposits  increased short term borrowings  and continued repricing of deposits and other borrowings as a result of the previously discussed drop in interest rates 
the percentage of average non time deposits to total average deposits has improved significantly over the past three years  with the ratio at in compared to in  and in interest bearing deposits 
average non time interest bearing deposits grew in excluding acquisitions and in excluding acquisitions 
this growth was primarily the result of efforts to emphasize relationship deposit growth and the impact of lower rates on other deposit products 
as the company de emphasized higher cost time deposits in  average time deposits decreased excluding acquisitions compared to the average rate on interest bearing deposits excluding time deposits dropped to for compared to for and for the rate on time deposits declined to an average of in compared to for and in borrowings 
total borrowings increased over the past two years primarily due to earning asset growth and a decline in time deposits as discussed above 
the percentage of average total borrowings to total assets was for  for  and for the increase was primarily short term in nature in order to fund the short term increases in mortgage warehouse lending  mortgage loans held for sale and floating rate loan demand 
short term borrowings averaged billion in up billion from the average rate on short term borrowings declined basis points to in versus in and in the average balance of long term debt increased million in versus a million increase in the increase in long term debt was used to fund securities purchases  bank owned life insurance boli purchases and to provide additional liquidity for future acquisitions 
bancgroup entered into interest rate swaps in to convert the fixed interest rates on million of existing subordinated debt and million of junior subordinated debt that was issued in september to floating rates 
bancgroup also entered into a million three year floating rate repurchase agreement 
as a result the average cost of long term debt fell basis points to in from in net interest margin as a result of the impact of rates  volumes and changes in asset mix  as previously discussed  the net interest margin declined from in to in the yield on earning assets fell basis points in to compared to and in and  respectively 
the decline in yield on earning assets was not completely offset by a decline of basis points in in the cost of interest bearing liabilities to compared to and in and  respectively 
even though on an annual basis the margin declined  bancgroup was able to keep the margin stable at throughout the first three quarters of  and improved to in the fourth quarter 
bancgroup s interest rate risk position is further described in the section interest rate sensitivity average noninterest earning assets average noninterest earning assets increased million to billion from to and million to billion from to the increase was due largely to an increase in boli and noninterest earning assets obtained through acquisitions  such as goodwill and fixed assets 
average noninterest bearing liabilities average noninterest bearing deposits increased by million from to  a increase excluding acquisitions 
as a result of this growth and the company s continuing effort to increase low cost or no cost deposits  the noninterest bearing deposit mix improved to of total deposits in up from in and in loan loss provision the provision for loan losses for the year ended december  was million compared to million for and million for net charge offs were  and of average loans for the years ended december   and  respectively 
at december  bancgroup has a reserve coverage of nonperforming loans compared to at december  and at december  see management s discussion of nonperforming assets and summary of loan loss experience presented in the review of financial condition section of this report 
noninterest income one of bancgroup s primary strategies has been to expand its noninterest income 
the company continues to emphasize growth in financial planning services  mortgage origination income  electronic banking services and cash management services 
these services provide a broad base of revenue generation capabilities 
noninterest income excluding securities gains increased million or from to and million or from to noninterest income including securities gains increased in and in years ended december  increase decrease compared to compared to in thousands noninterest income service charges on deposit accounts financial planning services electronic banking mortgage origination securities gains  net bank owned life insurance other income total noninterest income the increase in service charges on deposit accounts in is primarily due to the growth in deposits  the management of fee collection  an increase in cash management services revenues and revenue enhancement initiatives 
the increase in was primarily the result of increased account analysis fees and the acquisitions completed in financial planning services include discount brokerage  investment sales  asset management  trust services and insurance sales including term  universal  whole life and long term care 
the increase in was the result of additional sales of investment and annuity products as well as an increase in revenue from trust services due to the acquisition of palm beach national in september the increase in was primarily the result of an increase in fixed rate annuity sales 
the sales of annuity products fluctuated with changing market interest rates while the sales of investment products fluctuated with customer confidence in the stock market 
electronic banking services enable our customers to bank when and where they want 
electronic banking includes an atm network  business and personal check card services and our internet banking with bill pay service 
the increases in electronic banking fees are primarily the result of deposit growth with focused cross sales of electronic services to new and existing depositors by way of targeted promotions such as atm card to check card conversion initiatives  rewards for check card purchases and event triggered email campaigns to internet banking customers encouraging use of the online bill payment service 
electronic banking revenues began to decline in the third quarter of as a result of visa s settlement with its merchant customers  however  these declines were partially offset by increased debit card penetration as well as increased usage of electronic banking products 
mortgage origination is available in all of colonial s banking regions 
a central mortgage processing unit that facilitates the production and sale of mortgage products supports each region 
colonial offers both adjustable and fixed rate products 
adjustable rate products are generally retained in colonial s loan portfolio while fixed rate products are sold in the secondary market 
income from loans originated and subsequently sold in the secondary market is reflected in noninterest income 
mortgage origination volume and product mix are affected by changes in mortgage interest rates  therefore  mortgage banking revenues were high during the first half of and then dropped off as long term rates increased in the second half of mortgage origination income from secondary market loans increased to million in and to million in due to the lower mortgage rates available in both years 
lower rates created increased demand for fixed rate products and fueled an increase in home purchases and refinancing of existing home mortgages 
income from boli increased in and in over the previous years due to additional purchases of boli in the amounts of million in and million in december the company recorded approximately million in other income from option trading in included in other income is million and million for and  respectively  in revenue from merchant services and credit cards 
the company s contracts are expected to be renegotiated in as a result the company may experience initial declines in revenues but would expect better customer service and the ability to more aggressively sell these services 
other income for also includes an increase in income from ore gains of million 
the remainder of other income also includes revenues from customer check related fees  wire fees  letter of credit fees  and safe deposit box rental income  as well as other miscellaneous items 
noninterest expense noninterest expense to average assets was in and in and in support of the company s sales culture  bancgroup continues to make strategic investments in its people  product and service offerings  technology systems  sales incentives and branch network to enhance the company s franchise 
additional franchise enhancements included the strategic repositioning of branches within our markets through the opening of nine new locations in existing florida  texas and nevada markets and the closing of seven locations in alabama  florida and georgia 
in addition to these branches  the company also made investments in improved automation of branch delivery systems eagle  enhanced internet banking and wire transfer systems and network infrastructure improvements 
accordingly  noninterest expense increased and in and  respectively

as a result  additional investments were made in key personnel for leadership roles in commercial and industrial lending  small business initiatives  treasury and operational resources 
also included in salary increases for and are additional employees from bank acquisitions  branch openings  normal salary increases  additional production and incentive related compensation  and increased pension and health benefit costs 
occupancy expense for the years ended december  and increased million and million  respectively 
the increases were primarily the result of acquisitions  a new technology center that opened in the fourth quarter of and the strategic repositioning of branches within our markets as previously discussed 
furniture and equipment expense increased million in and million during the increase in was primarily due to the rollout of the new eagle technology system in the company s branches during  the installation of new software and upgrades to our network infrastructure  as well as the addition of nine new branches and completed acquisitions 
amortization of intangible assets increased million during and decreased million during the decrease in resulted from the implementation of sfas no 
on january  sfas no 
stipulated that goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer to be amortized 
instead  impairment testing will be performed at least annually on all goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
amortization of identifiable intangible assets  such as core deposits  will continue 
the increase in core deposit intangible amortization resulted from the acquisition of sarasota bank and the acquisitions of palm beach national and first mercantile 
advertising expenses increased million during as a result of the company s marketing efforts related to its emphasis on deposit growth 
insurance expense increased million during as a result of increased rates on policy premiums 
the increase in legal expenses in and was related to normal business issues  the occ conversion in  as well as additional work related to new or proposed banking and securities laws and regulations

the company acquired sarasota bancorporation in the details of this acquisition are included at note to the consolidated financial statements 
these items  as well as a more detailed analysis of bancgroup s financial condition  are discussed in the following sections 
loans growth in loans and maintenance of high asset quality are key components for improved earnings 
management s emphasis  within all of bancgroup s banking regions and specialized lending divisions  is on loan growth in accordance with local market demands and in reliance upon the lending experience and portfolio management expertise in these regions and divisions 
management believes that its strategy of meeting local demands and using local lending expertise has proved successful  especially when combined with the expertise offered by the managers of the specialized lending divisions such as mortgage warehouse and residential real estate 
loan growth in the company s regions  which excludes mortgage warehouse lending and family mortgages  was slow through the first half of but picked up in the second half of the year 
the strongest loan growth was in the southwest florida region with in and in  the nevada region with in and  the bay area region with in and for  and the central florida region with for and for the growth in the southwest florida region is primarily from the acquisition of sarasota bank in the fourth quarter of bancgroup has a significant concentration of commercial real estate and construction loans representing and of total loans  respectively 
bancgroup s commercial real estate and construction loans are spread geographically throughout alabama  florida and other areas including metropolitan atlanta  dallas  reno and las vegas with no more than of total commercial real estate and construction loans in any one metropolitan statistical area msa 
the alabama economy experiences a generally slow but steady rate of growth  while georgia  florida  nevada and texas are experiencing higher rates of growth 
real estate in bancgroup s main lending areas has not experienced significantly inflated values due to excessive speculation or inflationary pressures 
the collateral held in the commercial real estate and construction portfolios consists of various property types such as retail properties  multi family housing  office buildings  lodging  warehouses  amusement recreational facilities  one to four family residential housing developments  and health service facilities 
the relatively small average loan size and the application of conservative underwriting guidelines further reduce risk 
bancgroup s commercial real estate and construction loans continue to perform at acceptable levels 
net charge offs to average loans for the commercial real estate portfolio were and for and  respectively 
net charge offs to average loans for the construction portfolio were and for and  respectively 
substantially all construction and commercial real estate loans have personal guarantees of the principals involved 
the owner occupied commercial real estate portfolio represented of the total commercial real estate portfolio outstanding at december  owner occupied real estate is primarily dependent on cash flows from operating businesses rather than on the sale or rental of the property  therefore  colonial believes these loans carry less risk than other commercial real estate loans 
residential real estate loans represent of total loans in compared to in substantially all of these loans are adjustable rate first mortgages on single family  owner occupied properties  and therefore  have generally less credit risk and lower interest rate sensitivity 
demand for this type of loan has declined as more borrowers are looking for fixed rate loans  which the company originates  but sells in the secondary market 
bancgroup has a history of successfully lending in the residential real estate market and its quality ratios remain favorable in this portfolio segment 
net charge offs to average loans for the residential real estate portfolio was for compared to for the growth in this portfolio was mainly in home equity lines of credit which grew during and now represent of residential real estate loans the home equity line portfolio represented of the residential real estate portfolio in 
in  colonial launched several new equity line products and set loan growth goals to increase this product line 
loans classified as commercial  financial  and agricultural  representing of total loans  consist of secured and unsecured credit lines and equipment loans for various industrial  agricultural  commercial  financial  retail  or service businesses 
the risks associated with loans in this category are generally related to the earnings capacity of  and the cash flows generated from  the individual business activities of the borrowers 
in the fourth quarter of  colonial started implementation of two initiatives designed to grow and improve the quality of the commercial  financial  and agricultural loan portfolio 
one initiative will target small business customers and the other will focus primarily on larger commercial deals including owner occupied real estate credits which colonial feels are more closely aligned with the commercial loan portfolio than the commercial real estate portfolio 
the benefits of these initiatives should be seen in and subsequent years 
consumer loans  representing of total loans  are loans to individuals for various purposes 
automobile loans and unsecured loans make up the majority of these loans 
the principal source of repayment is the earning capacity of the individual borrower  as well as the value of the collateral for secured loans 
bancgroup established a mortgage warehouse lending division in this department provides lines of credit collateralized by residential mortgage loans to mortgage origination companies  predominantly in the southeast 
mortgage warehouse loan volume increased month over month until july  then volumes significantly decreased throughout the rest of the year as long term interest rates increased resulting in a year over year decline in outstanding balances 
loans outstanding at december  and  were million and billion  respectively  with unfunded commitments of billion and million at december  and  respectively 
bancgroup does not have a syndicated lending department  however  the company has credits with commitments funded and unfunded of million that fall within the bank regulatory definition of a shared national credit generally defined as a total loan commitment in excess of million that is shared by three or more lenders 
the largest outstanding amount to any single borrower is million which is a mortgage warehouse lending credit  with the smallest credit being approximately  at december   million of these commitments were funded 
although by definition these commitments are considered shared national credits  bancgroup s loan officers have established long term relationships with each of these borrowers 
these commitments are comprised of the following mortgage warehouse lines to large institutions  nine commercial real estate facilities with headquarters located within colonial s existing markets  seven international credits to four latin american correspondent banks  and two operating facilities one to a large national corporation headquartered in alabama and the other to an alabama municipality 
management believes that these are sound participations involving credits that fit within colonial s lending philosophy and meet its conservative underwriting guidelines 
as discussed more fully in subsequent sections  management has established policies and procedures designed to ensure maintenance of adequate liquidity and liquidity sources 
bancgroup has arranged funding sources in addition to customer deposits that provide the company the capability to exceed a loan to deposit ratio and maintain adequate liquidity 
gross loans by category december  in thousands commercial  financial and agricultural real estate commercial real estate construction real estate residential installment and consumer mortgage warehouse lending other total loans less unearned income net loans management believes that its existing distribution of loans  whether grouped geographically  by industry  or by borrower  reduces bancgroup s risk exposure 
the current distribution of loans remains diverse in location  size  and collateral function 
this diversification  in addition to our emphasis on quality underwriting  serves to reduce the risk of losses

at december   approximately of loans were floating adjustable rate loans 
contractual maturities may vary significantly from actual maturities due to loan extensions  early payoffs due to refinancing and other factors 
fluctuations in interest rates are also a major factor in early loan payoffs 
the uncertainties of future events  particularly with respect to interest rates  make it difficult to predict the actual maturities

bancgroup s strategy in this regard is carried out through its policies and procedures for the underwriting and ongoing review of loans and through a company wide senior credit administration function 
this function reviews larger credits prior to approval and also provides an independent review of credits on a continual basis 
in addition  the company has established regional loan committees made up of local officers and directors that approve loans up to certain levels 
these committees provide local business and market expertise while bancgroup s senior management provides independent oversight by participating in the state loan committees 
bancgroup has standard policies and procedures for the evaluation of new credits  including debt service evaluations and collateral guidelines 
collateral guidelines vary with the creditworthiness of the borrower  but generally require maximum loan to value ratios of for commercial real estate  for construction  for development  and for residential real estate 
commercial non real estate  financial and agricultural loans are generally collateralized by business inventory  accounts receivables or new business equipment at  and of estimated value  respectively 
installment and consumer loan collateral  where required  is based on or lower loan to value ratios 
collateral values referenced above are monitored and estimated by loan officers through inspections  independent appraisals  reference to broad measures of market values  and current experience with similar properties or collateral 
loans with loan to value ratios in excess of have potentially higher risks which are offset by other factors including the borrowers or guarantors creditworthiness  the borrowers other banking relationships  the bank s lending experience with the borrowers  and any other potential sources of repayment 
the overall goal and result of these policies and procedures is to provide a sound basis for new credit extensions and an early recognition of problem assets to allow increased flexibility in their timely disposition 
allowance for loan losses colonial  through its lending and credit functions  continuously reviews its loan portfolio for credit risk 
colonial employs an independent credit review area that reviews the lending and credit functions to validate that credit risks are appropriately identified 
the company remains committed to the early recognition of problem loans and to ensuring an adequate level of allowance to cover losses 
at december   the company s total allowance was million  which represented of period end loans as compared to million at december   which represented of period end loans 
using input from the company s comprehensive credit risk identification process  the company s credit risk management area analyzes and validates the company s loan loss reserve methodology at least quarterly 
the analysis includes three basic elements specific allowances for individual loans  general allowances for loan pools  and allowances based on identified economic conditions and other risk factors 
the credit risk management area along with senior management review and ensure the methodology is appropriate and that all risk elements have been assessed in order to determine the appropriate level of allowance for the inherent losses in the loan portfolio at each quarter end 
in addition  the allowance methodology is discussed with and reviewed quarterly by the audit committee 
the first element of the allowance for loan losses analysis involves the calculation of specific allowances for individual impaired loans as required by sfas and in addition  the company requires that a broad group of loans be tested for impairment each quarter this includes all loans of  and over that have internal risk ratings below a predetermined classification level plus all significantly past due loans of  and over 
the credit risk management area validates all impairment testing and validates the reserve allocations for all impaired loans each quarter 
reserves associated with this element are based on a thorough analysis of the most probable sources of repayment which is normally the liquidation of collateral  but also includes discounted future cash flows or the market value of the loan itself 
as of december  and  the specific allowance calculations for this element of the allowance totaled million and million  respectively 
the decrease in the reserve between these two periods primarily resulted from a decline in the dollar amount of loans that met the criteria for impaired status 
the second reserve element is the general allowance for loan pools assessed by applying loan loss allowance factors to groups of loans within the portfolio that have similar characteristics 
this part of the methodology is governed by sfas the general allowance factors are based upon recent and historical charge off experience and are typically applied to the portfolio by loan type and internal risk rating 
historical loss analyses provide the basis for factors used for homogenous pools of smaller loans  such as residential real estate and other consumer loan categories which are not evaluated based on individual risk ratings but almost entirely based on historical losses 
the statistics used in this analysis of this second reserve element are adjusted quarterly based on loss trends and risk rating migrations 
as of december  and  the general allowance calculations totaled million and million  respectively 
the increase between the periods was primarily the result of additional overdraft activity and the increased charge off experience in the commercial  financial  and agricultural portfolio including international credits in the last year which was partially offset by lower criticized and classified risk assets 
the third element of the allowance is established for economic conditions and other risk factors and is permitted under sab this part of the reserve focuses on risks that are not evaluated in the first two reserve elements 
the company analyzes and revises this part of the allowance at least quarterly 
the qualitative risk factors of this third allowance segment are subjective and require a high degree of management judgment 
the increase in the allowance calculated for economic conditions and other risk factors was million in the change in this portion of the reserve is attributed to a noted decline in the quality of some of the higher risk credits that were impacted by the economy

when management determines that a loan no longer meets the criteria for a performing loan and collection of interest appears doubtful  the loan is placed on nonaccrual status 
loans are generally placed on nonaccrual if full collection of principal and interest becomes unlikely even if all payments are current or if the loan is delinquent in principal or interest payments for days or more  unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection 
bancgroup s policy is to charge off consumer installment loans days past due unless they are in the process of foreclosure and are adequately collateralized 
management closely monitors all loans that are contractually days past due  renegotiated or nonaccrual 
these loans are summarized as follows nonperforming assets december  in thousands aggregate loans for which interest is not being accrued aggregate loans renegotiated to provide a reduction or deferral of interest or principal because of deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower total nonperforming loans other real estate and in substance foreclosure repossessions total nonperforming assets aggregate loans contractually past due days for which interest is being accrued total nonperforming loans as a percent of net loans total nonperforming assets as a percent of net loans  other real estate and repossessions total nonperforming loans and day past due loans for which interest is being accrued as a percent of net loans allowance for loan loss as a percent of nonperforming loans nonaccrual and renegotiated total does not include loans contractually past due days or more  which are still accruing interest fluctuations from year to year in the balances of nonperforming assets are attributable to several factors including changing economic conditions in various markets  nonperforming assets obtained in various acquisitions and the disproportionate impact of larger over million individual credits 
management  through its loan officers  internal credit review staff and external examinations by regulatory agencies  has identified approximately million of loans  which have been placed on a classified loan list excluding nonaccrual  other real estate  repossessions and loans that are contractually days past due 
the status of all material classified loans is reviewed at least monthly by loan officers  quarterly by bancgroup s centralized credit administration function and annually by regulatory agencies 
in connection with such reviews  collateral values are updated where considered necessary 
if collateral values are judged insufficient or other sources of repayment inadequate  the amount of reserve held is increased or the loan is reduced to estimated recoverable amounts 
as of december   substantially all of these loans are current with their existing repayment terms 
management believes that classification of such loans well in advance of their reaching a delinquent status allows the company the greatest flexibility in correcting problems and providing adequate reserves 
given the reserves and the ability of the borrowers to comply with the existing repayment terms  management believes any exposure from these loans has been adequately addressed at the present time 
the above nonperforming loans represent all material credits for which management has serious doubts as to the ability of the borrowers to comply with the loan repayment terms 
management also expects that the resolution of these problem credits as well as other performing loans will not materially impact future operating results  liquidity or capital resources 
interest income recognized and interest income foregone on nonaccrual loans was not significant for the years ended december      and a loan is considered impaired  based on current information and events  if it is probable that the company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
as mentioned previously  colonial s credit risk management area performs detailed verification and testing to ensure appropriate identification of impaired loans and that proper reserves are held on these loans 
the recorded investment in impaired loans at december  and was million and million  respectively  and these loans had a corresponding valuation allowance of million and million  respectively 
the average investment in impaired loans during and totaled million and million  respectively 
the decrease in impaired loans is primarily due to the resolution of several problem credits 
securities bancgroup determines the funds available for investment based upon anticipated loan and deposit growth  liquidity needs and pledging requirements  as well as other factors 
an investment strategy is developed based on these factors  along with the bank s balance sheet position and relative value opportunities in the market 
all securities are either classified as held to maturity or available for sale 
held to maturity securities are those securities which management has the ability and intent to hold until maturity 
the carrying value of held to maturity investments was million at the end of compared to million at year end the aforementioned decline was due to paydowns  maturities and calls in the portfolio 
securities classified as held to maturity consisted primarily of us treasury bonds  agency mortgage backed securities and municipal obligations 
overall  the stated maturity of these securities was years with an average life of years 
securities available for sale represent those securities that the company intends to hold for an indefinite period of time and may be sold in response to changes in the bank s interest rate position  prepayment risk or other similar factors 
these securities are recorded at market value with unrealized gains or losses  net of any tax effect  added to or deducted from shareholders equity 
at december   available for sale securities totaled billion or of the total portfolio versus billion or at the end of the increase of million in resulted from the investment of excess liquidity during a period of lower loan growth 
overall  the stated maturity of these securities was years with an average life of years and an average duration of years excluding equities 
stated maturities differ from average lives because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay certain obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties 
the following chart details bancgroup s available for sale securities at december  by category logo bancgroup s policy requires all securities purchased for the securities portfolio be of investment grade quality 
the purchase of non rated municipal securities is limited by policy to those bonds in the general market served by bancgroup which provide opportunities for additional banking business

deposits bancgroup s deposit structure consists of the following december  of total in thousands noninterest bearing demand deposits interest bearing demand deposits savings deposits non time deposits certificates of deposits less than  certificates of deposits more than  ira s open time deposits total deposits bancgroup is continuing to grow deposits throughout its market areas 
the company s sales and relationship development programs are designed to capitalize on the higher growth opportunities in florida  georgia  texas and nevada 
non time deposits grew in including growth in noninterest bearing deposits and  respectively  excluding the impact of sarasota bank 
time deposits declined throughout the first nine months of  however  run off slowed in the fourth quarter 
as a result  the mix of non time deposits improved to of total deposits from of total deposits at the end of the prior year 
as market demographics change  products and services are restructured to meet the needs of a particular region or customer base 
strong regional management supported by bancgroup s marketing and treasury departments provide the company with resources to remain competitive in its deposit markets 
the following chart details bancgroup s non time deposit base by state at december  logo at december   the scheduled maturities of time deposits in amounts of  or more were as follows months to maturity in thousands or less over through over through over total interest rate sensitivity bancgroup has an asset liability management committee almco  the objective of which is to optimize the net interest margin while assuming reasonable business risks 
almco annually establishes operating constraints for critical elements of bancgroup s business  including interest rate sensitivity 
the goal of almco is to minimize the volatility in the net interest margin caused by changes in interest rates by taking an active role in managing the level  mix  and repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities 
almco monitors the projected impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income by running an income simulation model under multiple rate scenarios 
over the course of  the company moved to a more neutral interest rate risk position as it became clear that the federal reserve was unlikely to raise short term interest rates any time in the near future 
this shift was due to specific actions taken by management such as the expansion of the securities portfolio  the short term funding of earning asset growth in excess of deposit growth and the conversion of fixed rate debt to floating rate via interest rate swaps 
a further discussion of the balance sheet changes can be found in the net interest income section 
the following table represents the output from the company s simulation model based on the balance sheet at december   when the fed funds rate was 
the table measures the impact on net interest income of an immediate and sustained change in all market interest rates in basis point increments for the calendar months following the date of the change 
this twelve month projection of net interest income under these scenarios is compared to the twelve month net interest income projection with rates unchanged 
basis points change fed funds rate percentage change in month projected net interest income versus projected net interest income under no rate change no rate change the computation of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions  including relative levels of market interest rates  estimates of rates on loans and deposits given these rate changes  the ability to maintain interest rate floors on loans as market rates decline  deposit decay rates and loan investment prepayments 
further  the computations do not take into account changes to the slope of the yield curve  changes in the relative relationship of various market rates  changes in the volume or mix of asset and liabilities on the balance sheet nor do they contemplate any actions bancgroup could undertake in response to changes in interest rates 
the following table represents the output of the simulation model for the economic value of equity eve  which is defined as the net present value of interest rate sensitive assets  interest rate sensitive liabilities and off balance sheet contracts 
the table represents the percentage change in the eve under basis point parallel rate shocks versus the eve assuming rates at december  and basis points change fed funds rates change in net portfolio value vs 
eve under no rate change december  december  no rate change liquidity another prominent focus of almco is maintaining and managing adequate liquidity 
liquidity is the ability of an organization to meet its financial commitments and obligations on a timely basis 
these commitments and obligations include credit needs of customers  withdrawals by depositors  repayment of debt when due and payment of operating expenses and dividends 
management of liquidity also includes management of funding sources and their utilization based on current  future and contingency needs 
retail deposit growth is a primary focus of bancgroup s funding and liquidity strategy 
in an effort to focus on deposits and relationship growth  bancgroup introduced and promoted a money market account which grew over million in the rd and th quarters of total non time deposits including the aforementioned money market grew at a rate of in to provide million of funding 
with branches in four of the top five population growth states  management expects that retail deposits should continue to be a major component of funding growth 
bancgroup has worked to expand the availability of short term and long term wholesale funding sources in addition to the emphasis on core deposit growth 
availability from the federal home loan bank of atlanta fhlb is an important part of bancgroup s wholesale funding sources 
as of december   the lendable collateral value pledged at fhlb amounted to billion up from billion the prior year 
continued loan growth is likely to increase the lendable collateral value and the fhlb will continue to provide an important source of wholesale liquidity 
bancgroup has unpledged securities of million which are available to collateralize borrowings 
other wholesale funding sources include fed funds purchased and brokered cd s 
management believes its liquidity sources and funding strategies are adequate given the nature of its asset base and current loan demand 
bancgroup utilized at december  compared to at december  of total wholesale funding sources estimated to be available to the company 
borrowings bancgroup utilizes a variety of funding sources to assist in meeting its needs of funding loan growth  securities acquisitions and deposit fluctuations 
fed funds lines  repurchase agreements and issuances of commercial paper are sources for short term borrowings 
credit facilities with the fhlb are used for both short and long term borrowings 
due to improved liquidity and resources  bancgroup discontinued its million revolving credit facility with an unrelated financial institution 
from time to time bancgroup has issued subordinated debentures  subordinated notes and trust preferred securities to provide both capital and funding 
over the course of  bancgroup focused on short term borrowings to best manage its interest rate risk and to match the short term funding requirement of mortgage warehouse lending cycles 
by year end  fed funds were de emphasized and repurchase agreements and short term borrowings from the fhlb were increased 
bancgroup  through a special purpose trust  issued million in trust preferred securities on september  the securities carry a rate of and mature in october the special purpose trust has an option to call the securities at par on or after october  the securities qualify for tier capital treatment 
in connection with this issuance  bancgroup executed an interest rate swap to convert the fixed rate to a floating rate

capital adequacy and resources management is committed to maintaining capital at a level sufficient to protect shareholders and depositors  provide for reasonable growth and fully comply with all regulatory requirements 
management s strategy to achieve these goals is to retain sufficient earnings while providing a reasonable return to shareholders in the form of dividends and return on equity 
the company s dividend payout ratio target range is 
dividend rates are determined by the board of directors in consideration of several factors including current and projected capital ratios  liquidity and income levels and other bank dividend yields and payment ratios 
the amount of a cash dividend  if any  rests with the discretion of the board of directors of bancgroup as well as upon applicable statutory constraints such as the delaware law requirement that dividends may be paid only out of capital surplus and net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and the preceding fiscal year 
bancgroup also has access to equity capital markets through both public and private issuances 
management considers these sources and related return in addition to internally generated capital in evaluating future expansion or acquisition opportunities 
the federal reserve board has issued guidelines identifying minimum tier i leverage ratios relative to total assets and minimum capital ratios relative to risk adjusted assets 
the minimum leverage ratio is for bank holding companies that meet certain specified criteria  including that they have the highest regulatory rating 
a minimum leverage ratio of is required for all bank holding companies not meeting this criteria 
higher capital ratios may be required for any bank holding companies if warranted by its particular circumstance or risk profile 
the minimum risk adjusted capital ratios established by the federal reserve are for tier i and for total capital 
bancgroup s actual capital ratios and the components of capital and risk adjusted asset information subject to regulatory review as of december  are stated below capital dollars in thousands tier i capital shareholders equity excluding unrealized gains losses on securities available for sale and intangible assets plus trust preferred securities tier ii capital allowable loan loss reserve subordinated debt of net unrealized gains on available for sale equity securities total capital risk adjusted assets quarterly average assets excluding intangible assets and unrealized gains losses on securities available for sale december  december  tier i leverage ratio risk adjusted capital ratios tier i capital ratio total capital ratio due to the adoption of fin  bancgroup no longer reflects trust preferred securities on its consolidated statement of condition  but rather reflects these securities as junior subordinated debentures 
however  under current regulatory guidelines  these securities continue to qualify for tier capital treatment 
bancgroup has increased capital gradually through normal earnings retention as well as through stock registrations to capitalize acquisitions 
the increases in the risk adjusted tier i ratios shown above are primarily due to the issuance of million in trust preferred securities in these securities provide additional flexibility for liquidity  capital management and growth 
the basel committee on banking supervision  consisting of central bank supervisors from countries  is developing a new set of risk based capital standards  on which it has received significant input from bancgroup and other major banking organizations 
the basel committee intends to finalize the capital standards by mid and implement a new framework to begin in the us banking regulators published notices and requests for comment in late for the proposed implementation of the new basel capital accord in the united states 
bancgroup is currently assessing the potential impact of the proposed new capital standards  participating in efforts to refine the standards and monitoring the progress of the basel initiative 
regulatory restrictions as noted previously  dividends payable by national banks in any year  without prior approval of the appropriate regulatory authorities  are limited 
colonial bank is also required by law to maintain noninterest bearing deposits with the federal reserve bank to meet regulatory reserve requirements 
at december   these deposits were not material to bancgroup s funding requirements

industry factors as a financial services company  our earnings are significantly affected by general business and economic conditions 
our business and earnings are impacted by general business and economic conditions in the united states and abroad 
these conditions include short term and long term interest rates  inflation  monetary supply  fluctuations in both debt and equity capital markets  and the strength of the us economy and the local economies in which we operate 
for example  an economic downturn  increase in unemployment  or other events that negatively impact household and or corporate incomes could decrease the demand for the company s loan and non loan products and services and increase the number of customers who fail to pay interest or principal on their loans 
our earnings are significantly affected by the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies 
the board of governors of the federal reserve system regulates the supply of money and credit in the united states 
its policies determine in large part our cost of funds for lending and investing and the return we earn on those loans and investments  both of which impact our net interest margin  and can materially affect the value of financial instruments we hold  such as debt securities 
its policies also can affect our borrowers  potentially increasing the risk that they may fail to repay their loans 
changes in federal reserve board policies are beyond our control and difficult to predict or anticipate 
the financial services industry is highly competitive 
we operate in a highly competitive industry which could become even more competitive as a result of legislative  regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation 
banks  securities firms and insurance companies can now merge by creating a relatively new type of financial services company called a financial holding company  which can offer virtually any type of financial service  including banking  securities underwriting  insurance both agency and underwriting and merchant banking 
a number of foreign banks have acquired financial services companies in the united states  further increasing competition in the us market 
also  technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for nonbanks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks  such as automatic transfer and automatic payment systems 
many of our competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and some have lower cost structures 
we are heavily regulated by federal agencies 
the holding company  its subsidiary bank and certain nonbank subsidiaries are heavily regulated by federal agencies 
this regulation is to protect depositors  federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole  not security holders 
congress and federal regulatory agencies continually review banking laws  regulations and policies for possible changes 
changes to statutes  regulations or regulatory policies  including changes in interpretation or implementation of statutes  regulations or policies  could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways including limiting the types of financial services and products we may offer and or increasing the ability of nonbanks to offer competing financial services and products 
also  our failure to comply with laws  regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulator agencies and damage to our reputation 
for more information  refer to discussions of regulatory considerations contained in item business and note  regulatory matters and restrictions 
future legislation could change our competitive position 
various legislation  including proposals to substantially change the financial institution regulatory system and to expand or contract the powers of banking institutions and bank holding companies  is from time to time introduced in the congress 
this legislation may change banking statutes and the operating environment of the company and its subsidiaries in substantial and unpredictable ways 
if enacted  such legislation could increase or decrease the cost of doing business  limit or expand permissible activities or affect the competitive balance among banks  savings associations  credit unions  and other financial institutions 
we cannot predict whether any of this potential legislation will be enacted  and if enacted  the effect that it  or any implementing regulations  would have on the financial condition or results of operations of the company or any of its subsidiaries 
we depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about customers and counterparties 
in deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions with customers and counterparties  we may rely on information furnished to us by or on behalf of customers and counterparties  including financial statements and other financial information 
we also may rely on representations of customers and counterparties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information and  with respect to financial statements  on reports of independent auditors 
for example  in deciding whether to extend credit  we may assume that a customer s audited financial statements conform with gaap and present fairly  in all material respects  the financial condition  results of operations and cash flows of the customer 
we also may rely on the audit report covering those financials statements 
our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted to the extent we rely on financial statements that do not comply with gaap or that are materially misleading 
consumers may decide not to use banks to complete their financial transactions 
technology and other changes are allowing parties to complete financial transactions that historically have involved banks 
for example  consumers can now pay bills and transfer funds directly without banks 
the process of eliminating banks as intermediaries  known as disintermediation  could result in the loss of fee income  as well as the loss of customer deposits and income generated from those deposits 
company factors maintaining or increasing our market share depends on market acceptance and regulatory approval of new products and services 
our success depends  in part  or our ability to adapt our products and services to evolving industry standards 
there is increasing pressure on financial services companies to provide products and services at lower prices 
this can reduce our net interest margin and revenues from our fee based products and services 
in addition  the widespread adoption of new technologies  including internet based services  could require us to make substantial expenditures to modify or adapt our existing products and services 
we might not successfully introduce new products and services  achieve market acceptance of our products and services  and or develop and maintain loyal customers 
the holding company relies on dividends from its subsidiaries for most of its revenue 
the holding company is a separate and distinct legal entity from its subsidiaries 
it receives substantially all of its revenue from dividends from its subsidiaries 
these dividends are the principal source of funds to pay dividends on the holding company s common stock and interest and principal on its debt 
various federal and or state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that our bank and certain of our nonbank subsidiaries may pay to the holding company 
also  the holding company s right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary s creditors 
for more information  refer to payment of dividends and other restrictions in item and note  regulatory matters and restrictions 
our accounting policies and methods are key to how we report our financial condition and results of operations  and they may require management to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations 
our management must exercise judgment in selecting and applying many of these accounting policies and methods so that not only do they comply with generally accepted accounting principles but also that they reflect management s judgment as to the most appropriate manner in which to record and report our financial condition and results of operations 
in some cases  management must select the accounting policy or method to apply from two or more alternatives  any of which might be reasonable under the circumstances yet might result in our reporting materially different amounts than would have been reported under a different alternative 
note  summary of significant accounting and reporting policies  to the consolidated financial statements describes our significant accounting policies 
we have identified two accounting policies as being critical to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations because they require management to make particularly subjective and or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because of the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
these critical accounting policies relate to allowance for loan losses  and goodwill impairment analysis 
because of the inherent uncertainty of estimates about these matters  we cannot provide any assurance that the company will not experience results significantly different from those expected at the time of accounting for acquisitions  significantly increase its allowance for loan losses and or sustain loan losses that are significantly higher than the amount reserved  significantly revise its estimates regarding the amount and timing of recognition of tax liabilities and assets 
for more information  refer in this report to critical accounting policies 
we have businesses other than banking 
we are a diversified financial services company 
in addition to banking  we provide insurance  investments and mortgages 
although we believe our diversity helps mitigate the impact to the company when downturns affect any one segment of our industry  it also means that our earnings could be subject to different risks and uncertainties 
we discuss one example below 
mortgage warehouse retail mortgage banking the impact of interest rates on our mortgage banking business can be large and complex 
changes in interest rates can impact the company s mortgage related revenues 
a decline in mortgage rates generally increases the demand for mortgage loans as borrowers refinance  but also generally leads to accelerated payoffs 
conversely  in a constant or increasing rate environment  we would expect fewer loans to be refinanced and a decline in payoffs 
although the company uses models to assess the impact of interest rates on mortgage related revenues  the estimates of net income produced by these models are dependent on estimates and assumptions of future loan demand  prepayment speeds and other factors which may overstate or understate actual subsequent experience 
we have an active acquisition program 
we regularly explore opportunities to acquire financial institutions and other financial services providers 
we cannot predict the number  size or timing of future acquisitions 
we typically do not comment publicly on a possible acquisition or business combination until we have signed a definitive agreement for the transaction 
our ability to successfully complete an acquisition generally is subject to regulatory approval  and we cannot be certain when or if  or on what terms and conditions  any required regulatory approvals will be granted 
we might be required to divest banks or branches as a condition to receiving regulatory approval 
difficulty in integrating an acquired company may cause us not to realize expected revenue increases  cost savings  increases in geographic or product presence  and or other projected benefits from the acquisition 
specifically  the integration process could result in higher than expected deposit attrition run off  loss of key employees  the disruption of our business or the business of the acquired company  or otherwise adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers and employees or achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition 
also  the negative impact of any divestitures required by regulatory authorities in connection with acquisitions or business combinations may be greater than expected 
our business could suffer if we fail to attract and retain skilled people 
our success depends  in large part  on our ability to attract and retain key people 
competition for the best people in most activities engaged in by the company can be intense 
we may not be able to hire people or to keep them 
our stock price can be volatile 
our stock price can fluctuate widely in response to a variety of factors including actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results  recommendations by securities analysts  new technology used  or services offered  by our competitors  significant acquisitions or business combinations  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments by or involving us or our competitors  failure to integrate our acquisitions or realize anticipated benefits from our acquisitions  operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to us  news reports relating to trends  concerns and other issues in the financial services industry  changes in government regulations  and geopolitical conditions such as acts or threats of terrorism or military conflicts 
general market fluctuations  industry factors and general economic and political conditions and events  such as economic slowdowns or recessions  interest rate changes or credit loss trends  also could cause our stock price to decrease regardless of our operating results
