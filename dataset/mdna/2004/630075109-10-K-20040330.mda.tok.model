item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
nanogen is a delaware corporation and its stock is listed on the nasdaq national market under the symbol ngen 
its corporate offices are located at pacific center court  san diego  california our main telephone number is our technology and relevant markets limitations of current molecular diagnostic assay technologies the initial technique for the analysis of genetic variations was hybridization  which was first developed in the s 
hybridization relies on the principle that a unique piece of dna will bind  or hybridize  most strongly to 
table of contents its exact complement 
in hybridization  short synthetic segments of dna  also known as probes  are used to locate and bind to their counterparts within a mixture of sample dna or rna 
hybridization is often performed using instrumentation that incorporates a detection medium that provides a signal to indicate whether the probe has hybridized to the sample dna or rna 
however  initial hybridization techniques had several limitations 
even minute changes in testing conditions could dramatically affect the outcome of the hybridization reaction and  therefore  the reliability of test results 
beginning in the s  various techniques were invented with the objective of improving the reliability of hybridization 
however  these methods did not generally provide a signal that was sufficient to be easily detectable 
therefore  in order to use these methods  it was necessary to first copy or amplify the segment of dna or rna to be analyzed using a technique known as polymerase chain reaction  or pcr 
these initial techniques have significant limitations in meeting the need of molecular diagnostic customers  including highly complex product development process conventional methods frequently require trial and error testing to validate tests or product designs 
therefore  with conventional technologies  the process of developing a test  or product  for analyzing a specific genetic variation is highly complex and cannot be automated easily 
inaccuracy accuracy is essential to adequately detect and quantify genetic variations  which may involve the analysis of thousands of genetic variations per individual 
conventional methods can result in one or more data points in being incorrect 
these inaccuracies are magnified in tests for multiple variations 
difficulty of use many of the conventional analysis methods involve multiple technical steps requiring human intervention  which make the analysis difficult to perform and challenging to automate 
lack of flexibility many of the conventional analysis methods use a passive array in which what is done to one site on the array  must be done to all sites 
this results in a lack of flexibility for the customer in using these technologies as they cannot mix different assays on a single array or may not fully utilize every site on the array 
limited clinical viability because of the low degree of accuracy and difficulties associated with product development and use  conventional research methods have not been broadly applicable to clinical settings 
beyond the limitations indicated above  in order to capture and expand the market for genetic analysis  one must provide cost effective and highly reliable tests 
despite recent advances in technology  many bioassays are too specialized or inflexible to be used throughout the various departments of a diagnostics or research laboratory 
current bioassay tools were designed for large scale data generation and the automation of repetitious tasks such as very high throughput discovery 
in addition  many of these systems are not useful in molecular  protein  enzyme  cell biology  and forensics laboratories 
these technologies fall primarily into three categories high density arrays  high throughput sequencing and snp discovery tools  and gel based methods 
while these technologies each have certain advantages  they also have significant drawbacks that inhibit their broad applicability across the life sciences market and in particular in the molecular diagnostics market 
the nanogen microelectronic solution today  clinical and research laboratories use a number of different platforms to perform a wide range of different molecular tests 
we are marketing the nanochip system based on our proprietary microelectronic technology 
the company believes that the nanochip system provides the following eight major advantages 
table of contents accuracy accuracy is critical in laboratory analysis 
to date  the nanochip system has been shown to be exceptionally accurate when performing various genetic molecular analysis 
additionally  the nanochip system embodies the technology that allows multiplexing capability 
this means that it allows two or more tests to be performed simultaneously  speeding results to the laboratory technician 
this capability has been critical in developing the asrs for use in detecting the mutations associated with cystic fibrosis 
simplicity 
the nanochip system is fully automated and once programmed and validated by the customer  has simple point and click software 
it allows the laboratory technician to load samples and easily modify parameters to facilitate minimal hands on time 
versatility one of the key attributes that positions the nanochip system as the platform for molecular diagnostics is its unique  open architecture 
the flexible  addressable nature of the nanochip cartridge enables assay development from a variety of sources 
we believe this is particularly important to customers in an emerging and rapidly growing market like molecular diagnostics  where new markers are constantly being introduced 
the ability of a molecular laboratory to respond quickly to customers who request a test for a new marker without having to procure a new platform is key to their success 
profit incentive nanogen s focus is to offer a compelling value proposition to end users by providing laboratories an alternative to sending out their tests to third party laboratories 
with nanogen products  these smaller laboratories should have the potential to earn additional profits by handling tests within their own facilities 
fast assay design experimental design of tests and assays on the nanochip system is relatively straightforward 
our customers can develop  program and validate assays in their own laboratories  allowing for faster turnaround times ie  days versus weeks for solutions to complex analyses 
ease of use assays are easy to develop  validate and perform on our nanochip system 
our fully automated loader allows the simultaneous programming and testing on up to four nanochip cartridges 
a loaded cartridge is inserted and then analyzed on the nanogen reader 
the nanochip system also includes proprietary software to automate testing operation 
all test design and development must be validated by the end user prior to reporting any results 
data interpretation that is user defined is clear cut and presented in a user friendly format 
throughput the nanochip system s ability to program as many as test sites per cartridge and up to four cartridges per run allows for higher throughput than is achievable with many competitive technologies 
as testing volumes in molecular laboratories continue to grow  throughput is becoming increasingly important 
we believe that the nanochip system is scalable to eventually utilize a cartridge with test sites at a time 
cost effectiveness the nanochip system has been designed to be a cost effective solution for most molecular testing 
the nanochip system s custom features allow users to employ their own reagents or nanogen s asrs in designing and validating assays for their specific purposes 
moreover  much of was dedicated to developing and marketing a menu of asrs that many laboratories perform routinely 
walk away automation conserves direct labor while improving the overall effectiveness of the laboratory operation 
in addition  user definability allows important experiments to be done quickly  both accelerating the discovery process and simplifying the validation of important targets 
nanogen s core technology nanogen s patented microelectronics based technology uses the natural positive or negative charge of most biological molecules 
applying an electric current to individual test sites on the nanochip system enables rapid movement and concentration of the molecules 
nanogen s technology involves electronically addressing biotinylated dna samples  hybridizing complementary dna and applying stringency to remove nonspecifically bound dna after hybridization 
the nanochip system technology provides an open platform that allows customers to effectively develop  validate and run common assays as well as customize their own tests 

table of contents the nanochip system can integrate in a single platform the following electronic operational features electronic addressing electronic addressing involves placing charged molecules at specific test sites on a nanochip microarray 
when a biotinylated sample solution is introduced onto the array  the negatively charged sample rapidly moves to the selected positively charged sites  where it is concentrated and bound to the streptavidin in the permeation layer 
the array is then washed and another sample can be added 
site by site  row by row  an array of samples are assembled on the array 
such user definable microchip arrays allow the customer to respond quickly to the ever evolving list of genes to be tested 
electronic concentration and hybridization in a standard snp assay  following electronic addressing  red and green fluorescently labeled reporter probes are used to discriminate between wildtype  heterozygote and mutant dna 
the ability of the nanochip technology to very specifically control binding of samples to reporters is a key feature of the platform 
stringency control stringency control enables removal of unbound and nonspecifically bound dna quickly and easily after hybridization  providing quality control and ensuring that any bound pairs of dna are truly complimentary 
nanogen s technology allows the customer to select electronic  thermal or chemical techniques  depending on the application  for precise  accurate stringency control 
this provides extremely high discrimination and confidence in results 
electronic multiplexing the multiplexing feature is an extension of the open platform of the nanochip system 
the customer may analyze multiple genes from a single test site representing one sample or from multiple test sites representing different samples 
the customer also has the ability to electronically address multiplexed amplicons to a single test site 
the ability to control individual test sites permits biochemically unrelated molecules to be used simultaneously on the same microchip array 
conventional dna arrays do not have this feature all process steps must be performed on an entire array 
nanogen s microelectronic array technology delivers increased versatility over conventional methods 
strand displacement amplification strand displacement amplification  or sda  is a proprietary target amplification process whereby very low numbers of diagnostic targets in a test sample are enzymatically amplified to exponentially higher levels  greatly simplifying accurate detection of these targets 
because this process does not require thermal cycling  it is extremely fast  and complex instrumentation for thermal regulation is not required 
we believe that sda may be an important element in the development of sample to answer applications for our technology platform 
we also believe that sda may potentially provide our customers with operational benefits such as being easier to use as well as cost advantages due to the high cost of the most common amplification method 
although the current nanochip system does not utilize sda  we expect to support sda applications on future instruments 
commercialization strategy platformation tm what is happening today in molecular diagnostics closely mirrors the activities that occurred in clinical chemistry laboratories thirty years ago 
the first clinical chemistry tests were done by hand they were time intensive and required great skill not unlike some of today s molecular diagnostic assays 
ultimately  the laboratory migrated from manual assays to automated accurate systems that could perform multiple assays simultaneously  increasing the reporting efficiency and reducing the time to a reportable result 

table of contents nanogen has focused on capturing the molecular diagnostics market by creating an open platform that we believe can automate laboratory testing 
the process of consolidating various molecular tests onto one platform is what we have termed platformation 
the company continually seeks to increase the installed base of the nanochip systems and to establish our platform as a standard for the molecular diagnostics industry in order to reap the benefits of the higher margin profits on consumables such as the nanochip cartridges  asrs and other products 
the nanochip system s open architecture facilitates development of molecular tests from multiple sources  driving the growth in assay development far beyond where nanogen could take it on its own 
the nanochip system could transform molecular diagnostics by  bringing to it the speed  efficiency and accuracy of a robust platform 
as this market area grows and nanogen s market share increases  the nanochip system could generate multiple revenue sources that will fuel next generation systems and the growth of the company 
nanogen s strategy to establish the nanochip system as the leading molecular diagnostics platform is five fold 
increase installed base of nanochip systems our first strategy is to increase the installed base of the nanochip molecular biology workstation in order to reap the benefits of the higher margin profits on consumables  such as the nanochip cartridges  asrs and other products 
the company has provided its customers with three main types of commercial transactions to obtain the nanochip system outright sales  reagent rental agreements and or cost per test agreements collectively  reagent rentals and development and strategic site agreements 
nanogen typically sells its nanochip systems directly to its customers through the company s sales representatives in the us or through distributors in europe and other countries throughout the world 
as of december   the company had placed nanochip systems 
the sale of nanochip systems is only one piece of the revenue stream 
as is common with clinical instruments  the consumables form a substantial revenue segment 
nanochip cartridges and asrs that are a part of each customer developed and validated assay will normally be ordered by customers to meet their testing demand 
nanogen anticipates demand to grow rapidly for certain asrs  such as those for the detection of mutations in the cftr gene that are associated with cystic fibrosis 
while there may always be customers who wish to purchase the nanochip system outright  it is our belief that there will be many high complexity clia certified clinical laboratories that will want to amortize the cost of the instrument over several years 
these arrangements  called reagent rentals  have been the standard for the clinical instruments industry for the past years  fueling the growth of industry leaders such as beckman coulter  abbott and roche 
such agreements can span from three to five years and involve establishing a minimum monthly consumables ordering level 
based on that level and the term of the agreement  a premium is added to the cost of the consumables so that the total capital equipment cost of the nanochip system is recouped by the end of the agreement 
the advantage of reagent rental agreements for nanogen is that it locks in a minimum revenue flow over the term of each agreement after a validation period that normally runs from to days 
nanogen believes that many of its customers will increase their consumable ordering levels as new asrs and ultimately fda cleared assays are made available 
the final type of agreement whereby a customer may use and eventually purchase a nanochip system  is a development or strategic site agreement 
these agreements are normally with leading research organizations and laboratories or companies that could provide us with certain rights to commercialize the discoveries made using our system 
these relationships have been focused on the discovery of the associations of specific genetic variations with major disease states  including cancer  hypertension  inflammation and cardiovascular disease 
nanogen installs a nanochip system at a customer site for a period ranging typically from six to twelve months during which time the customer can test the system by developing  validating and running certain assays on the system 
for the use of the system during this period  the customer typically assigns to nanogen rights to improvements to the system and nanogen and the customer agree on certain nanogen rights to any assays 
table of contents developed or other intellectual property discovered thereon 
once the agreement period has terminated  the customer may then either return the system to the company or purchase it through a sale or a reagent rental transaction 
increase the breadth of the asr menu on the nanochip system to further penetrate the clinical diagnostics market the second strategy is to increase the breadth of the nanochip system s asr menu for commercial applications 
each nanogen asr includes specific reagents that enable the customer to develop  validate and perform a molecular test that determines the presence or absence of certain gene mutations associated with certain disease states 
as part of nanogen s platformation strategy  the company seeks to increase the number of commercially available asrs that it provides its customers to increase the attractiveness of the nanochip system as well as to increase revenue from the sale of associated consumables 
during  nanogen introduced seven products  including five asrs  which may be utilized by customers for development of tests that detect gene mutations associated with diseases such as cystic fibrosis  hereditary hemochomotosis  canavan disease  beta thalasemia in europe and alzheimer s disease 
in the future  we intend to file with the fda for clearance to market both the next generation of the nanochip system and certain of our products for clinical diagnostics 
nanogen is currently putting in place the internal procedures and groundwork necessary to submit such products for clearance 
this may be a costly and time consuming process 
fda clearance will be essential to expanding our product offerings beyond clia certified laboratories 
development and introduction of research products our third strategy is to develop products that facilitate customers development and validation of their own home brew tests on the nanochip system 
we provide research customers with most of the tools and reagents needed to develop and validate their own home brew tests on our system and take advantage of our open architecture 
during  nanogen entered into a license agreement with institut pasteur and began development work on research reagents for the european market involving the detection of gene mutations associated with the diagnosis of hereditary deafness 
we also intend to develop and commercialize other products for our research customers 
while researchers want to use high throughput devices to discover genes and genetic mutations  they will want to explore the function and impact of these genes and mutations with a more accurate and targeted technology 
improve the nanochip system and increase the depth of other applications of the nanochip electronic microarray technology 
our fourth strategy is to continually improve the nanochip system through our engineering and advanced technology groups along with hitachi  the manufacturer of the nanochip system 
initial improvements will be focused on cost reduction and throughput 
in the long term  we would like to develop sample to answer systems which integrate otherwise time consuming and labor intensive sample preparation procedures onto a disposable cartridge 
the availability of this lab on a chip technology would fulfill a substantial unmet need in both commercial laboratory and academic research markets 
we also intend to continue the development of other technologies that may complement and improve the nanochip system  utilize the nanochip electronic microarray technology or are designed and developed by our employees or collaborators 
such products include those under development in the forensics  defense and pharmacogenomics arenas 
continue to establish strategic collaborations in order to strengthen our product menu  penetrate new markets  obtain new intellectual property and enter the service market when appropriate 

table of contents our fifth strategy is to enter into collaborations to expand applications of our technology platform and to accelerate the commercialization of products in order to strengthen our product menu  penetrate new markets  obtain new intellectual property and enter the molecular diagnostics service provider market when appropriate 
during the third quarter of  nanogen entered into a collaboration agreement with prodesse  inc  a biotechnology company focused on developing reagents that can be used by clia certified laboratories to develop assays to detect infectious pathogens 
the collaboration agreement involves the development of automated  highly sensitive microarray based products to detect a number of infectious disease agents  including influenza  pneumonia  adenovirus  herpes  west nile virus  and sars 
the companies will integrate prodesse s proprietary multiplex amplification technology with the automated nanochip platform and jointly develop and market gene based testing products to clinical reference labs and health care providers 
we will pursue additional collaborations in various forms  including research and development agreements  licensing agreements and joint ventures 
nanogen s current products nanochip system s components the company is seeking to establish the nanochip system as the standard platform for the detection of genetic mutations and to develop applications for future clinical use 
nanogen markets its nanochip molecular biology workstation to research and molecular diagnostics laboratories 
the nanochip system consists of a consumable cartridge containing a proprietary semiconductor microchip  the nanochip electronic microarray  a fully automated instrument and imbedded software that can be programmed by the end user to control all aspects of microchip operations  processing  detection and reporting 
the system has been designed so that once programmed  the end user need only insert a consumable cartridge into the instrument and all subsequent steps may be handled automatically under computer control 
the nanochip cartridge the consumable nanochip cartridge consists of a proprietary semiconductor microchip with electrical and fluidic connections to the instrument 
we expect that over time the consumable cartridge and microchip may be manufactured in high volumes at a low cost relative to many current technologies 
semiconductor microchip our proprietary microchip the nanochip electronic microarray is designed and constructed using microlithography and semiconductor fabrication techniques 
the nanochip electronic microarray is mounted within the consumable cartridge and is coated with a proprietary permeation layer 
we have developed arrays of various sizes utilizing both passive and active cmos microchips  as well as flip chip assembly technologies 
our current production of consumable cartridges employs different test sites on a single nanochip electronic microarray 
we are additionally developing a cartridge that employs different test sites on a single nanochip electronic microarray for our next generation instrument 
permeation layer our proprietary permeation layer  which is critical to the proper functioning of our system  is the reaction site of the microchip 
the permeation layer isolates the biological materials from the electrochemical environment near the electrode surface and provides the chemistry necessary for attachment of the samples 

table of contents samples samples are electronically addressed to the desired microlocations and attached to the permeation layer 
because independent control can be applied at any test site on our microchip  different samples can be addressed on the same microchip  allowing multiple tests to be processed on the same cartridge 
our open architecture approach allows the customer to address their specific samples onto a microchip to perform individualized analyses 
the nanochip molecular biology workstation our fully integrated nanochip system consists of four major subsystems a freestanding microchip loader to perform electronic addressing of blank microchips  a highly sensitive  laser based fluorescence scanner that detects molecular binding  a fluid handling subsystem that controls test sample application and washing steps  and are  collectively referred to as  the reader  and computer hardware and software that allow the operator to develop  validate and select protocols from a graphical user menu which controls all microchip operations  tabulates test results and prints test reports based upon user defined inputs 
microchip loader our system includes a cartridge microchip loader that will allow users to electronically address their own samples to selected test sites on up to four chips simultaneously 
in addition  hybridization can be performed on the loader or on the reader 
multiple loaders can operate concurrently under the control of one system 
fluorescent array scanner the fluorescent scanner component of the system uses optoelectronic technology to reduce instrument cost and size and eliminate the need for complicated array positioning mechanics 
in its present configuration  the scanner is able to perform high sensitivity scans of arrays of test sites in less than five minutes 
fluidics within the fluorescent array scanner component of the system  the fluidics function automates the movement of the reagents and test sample onto the consumable cartridge 
the fluidic subassembly of the instrument includes a panel of precision syringe pumps  a cartridge mounted sample assembly and fluidic connections between the instrument and the consumable cartridge 
computer hardware and software system a multi tasking operating system and microprocessor control all aspects of the systems operations  including bar coded test selection  test operation  fluorescent signal detection and signal processing  calculation of assay results and report generation 
the end user must develop and validate the protocols used by the software as well as define the parameters used to calculate results and generate reports 
each of the individual array locations is separately controlled by the microprocessor 
fluorescent signals emanating from positive test sites are scanned  monitored and quantified 
nanochip analysis process cartridge the electronic microchip is mounted within a plastic molded cartridge 
the bar coded cartridge is delivered in a ready to address format with no genetic sequences pre attached 

table of contents electronic addressing users design  create and validate their own genetic tests on the microelectronic chip with our automated system 
a well or well microtiter plate containing genetic sequences is placed in the loader 
the system then automatically electronically addresses the microchip with user defined tests 
hybridization and stringency users may add test samples to the cartridge and insert the cartridge into the reader 
the customer may then select to have the instrument automatically perform hybridization and the appropriate stringency control is selected by the user  chemical  thermal or electronic 
the electronically enhanced process speeds and improves the genetic analysis  allowing single base accuracy 
simple to read output within minutes of inserting the bar coded cartridge for analysis  easy to read and easy to interpret output is available based upon user defined inputs 
data can be automatically downloaded to network systems and to standard software spreadsheet packages 
the entire electronic addressing and data output process can be completed rapidly  allowing users to accelerate their research process by creating new genetic tests based on previous experimental results 
applications manager software ams nanogen currently offers a separately priced software package designed to streamline routine or frequent testing for the same genetic markers which must be validated by the customer 
ams enables users to run protocols they have written and validated for the nanochip system in a simplified  menu driven  point and click fashion 
this supplemental software offers the ease of use required of those laboratories that run the same set of tests on a regular basis 
it was designed in response to high complexity clia certified clinical laboratories that are frustrated by the research orientation of most of the currently available software 
we believe that this software provides a significant competitive advantage for the nanochip system 
analyte specific reagent asrs asrs are the specific reagents that enable either research or high complexity clia certified laboratory customers to develop  validate and run certain snp assays 
under the asrs model  we sell not only nanochip cartridges  but also the specific reagents that can be used to develop  validate and perform dna based tests 
we currently have five asrs that are commercially available for factor ii factor v multiplex launched in the first quarter  cftr launched in the first quarter  hfe launched in the first quarter  apoe launched in the second quarter  and aspa launched in the second quarter of below is a more detailed description of the asrs factor ii factor v multiplex asrs nanogen offers asrs for the detection of two genetic mutations associated with thrombosis the ga mutation on the factor v leiden gene and the ga mutation on the factor ii prothrombin gene 
clia certified high complexity laboratories may use the reagents to create and validate laboratory developed tests for detection of these two mutations 
currently  nanogen believes that it is the only provider of the factor v leiden and factor ii prothrombin mutations in a multiplexed format 
nanogen s factor ii factor v asrs are multiplexed asrs meaning that the customer can develop and validate multiple factor ii and factor v gene mutations from a single test site representing one sample or from multiple test sites representing different samples 
the customer also has the ability to electronically address multiplexed 
table of contents amplicons to a single test site 
the ability to control individual test sites permits biochemically unrelated molecules to be used simultaneously on the same microchip array 
conventional dna arrays do not have this feature  all process steps must be performed on an entire array 
nanogen s factor ii factor v asrs are a prime example of how our unique microelectronic array technology delivers increased versatility over conventional methods 
cftr asrs nanogen s cftr asrs enable the customer to develop and validate a test for the detection of the cftr mutations recommended by american college of medical genetics acmg american college of obstetrics and gynecology acog as part of a high complexity clia certified laboratory homebrew assay 
in early  we completed beta site testing of our set of asrs for use in developing and validating tests for the mutations in the cftr gene  which are associated with cystic fibrosis  and commenced a controlled release of the product to market 
many people carry a single cystic fibrosis gene mutation  and they do not experience any significant health problems 
in the general population  approximately in americans carries the gene mutations 
this is the reason acog announced that the standard of medical care should include screening women contemplating pregnancy for cystic fibrosis 
to meet the standard of medical care  a physician must at least offer screening to each woman contemplating pregnancy 
if initial screening of the prospective mother is positive for the cftr mutation  then further testing of the prospective father is warranted 
when both parents are carriers  they have a chance with every pregnancy of passing two copies of the defective gene to their child 
the current recommendation from acog is for a mutation screen 
we believe that the acog recommendations may drive a significant increase in genetic testing for gene mutations associated with cystic fibrosis 
hfe asrs nanogen offers asrs for the development and validation of a test to detect the three mutations associated with hereditary hemochromatosis hh 
hereditary hemochromatosis is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by unusually high levels of iron in the blood due to polymorphisms in the hfe gene 
excess iron accumulates over a period of years in the patients major organ systems 
clinical indications of hh include type ii diabetes also known as bronze diabetes  heart disease  arthritis  and liver disease 
our reagents include oligonucleotides for the detection of nucleotides corresponding to the cy  hd  and sc mutations of the hfe gene 
clia certified high complexity laboratories may use the reagents to create and validate laboratory developed tests ldt for hfe 
currently  nanogen s hfe asrs are the only asrs for use in developing and validating a test for the three mutations in the hfe gene 
apoe asrs in  nanogen non exclusively licensed rights to develop and commercialize asrs relating to apoe gene mutations linked to the detection of alzheimer s disease 
nanogen s apoe asrs consist of various reagents that may be used by laboratories to develop and validate a test for the detection of apoe  the main apolipoprotein e allele associated with increased risk for alzheimer s disease 
the alzheimer s association estimates that approximately million americans will develop the disease by aspa asrs during  nanogen entered into a non exclusive license agreement with a third party that provided it with rights to develop asrs for certain mutations in the aspa gene associated with canavan disease  a disease that has highest prevalence in the ashkenazi jewish community 
this community has historically been very proactive in the united states in advocating that its members undergo genetic testing prior to having children 
the aspa mutation detection test is a key member of a panel of multiple tests frequently used in an ashkenazi jewish 
table of contents genetic disease screening panel 
cystic fibrosis also is a key part of this panel and nanogen offers the asrs to enable customers to develop and validate an assay to test for the specific mutations associated with cystic fibrosis 
strategically  the aspa asrs are important as they provide patent licensure to the end user which has historically been a challenge for individual laboratories to obtain 
other current products assay toolbox the nanogen assay toolbox is a collection of general purpose reagents and accessories used to facilitate assay and protocol development and validation on the nanochip platform 
the assay toolbox components  together with oligos available from third party vendors  may be used to facilitate development and validation of laboratory developed tests by clia certified high complexity laboratories or research laboratories 
the unique  open architecture of the nanochip electronic microarray and instrumentation enables researchers to define  select and build their own test panels 
customers may be required to obtain third party licenses to the specific gene mutations for the assays that they seek to develop or validate 
beta thalassemia research reagents nanogen  working with a company in europe  developed a product for the detection of certain genes associated with beta thalassemia  a disease that is most prevalent in the mediterranean regions of europe 
these research reagents have been initially marketed through the european company as an alternative method for testing beta thalassemia 
nanogen s research use only product for beta thalassemia consists of various reagents that can be used to detect mutations of the hbb gene  which is most commonly associated with beta thalassemia 
mutations in the hbb gene affect the production of hemoglobin  a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen to tissues of the body 
people whose hemoglobin does not produce enough beta protein have beta thalassemia  which can cause life threatening anemia in children  for which there is no cure 
the frequency of this mutation in the general population is about one in however  people with mediterranean including north african  middle eastern or southeast asian ancestry have a risk of about one in for carrying this mutation  most likely related to the selective pressure from malaria 
beta thalassemia is an autosomal genetic disorder if both parents have the hbb disease causing gene  each offspring has a one in four risk of being affected 
products and applications in research and development we plan to further develop the nanochip system  integrating new features and broadening the applications of the currently marketed system  including enhancing chip design and simplifying instrument design 
our scientists will investigate new opportunities and develop and validate new protocols  asrs and products for use on the nanochip system  while customers may create and validate new home brew assays by taking advantage of the flexible format of the system 
we also intend to pursue new opportunities utilizing electronics beyond the current microchip concept 
for example  future technologies may include integration of sample processing and dna amplification 
the nanochip system may be designed to provide analysis of other charged molecules and antigen antibody  enzyme substrate  cell receptor  and cell separation techniques 
the nanochip system eventually may also become a portable lab on a chip for use in the field  away from the laboratory bench 
below is a brief description of some of future products and applications currently in research and development at either the company or with one of its collaborators 
next generation nanochip system as part of the nanogen hitachi collaboration  we have been working on improvements to the current nanochip system and the development of a next generation nanochip system 
we believe our next generation nanochip system should be more compact and less costly in order to access smaller hospital laboratories and other customers for molecular based testing 

table of contents additional potential asrs and other products infectious disease related products we believe we have the potential to apply our technology in the field of infectious disease diagnostics to develop automated tests to replace the manual and time intensive procedures used in hospitals and reference laboratories 
the role of the clinical microbiology laboratory is to detect and identify disease causing microorganisms and to determine antibiotic sensitivity 
to accomplish this task  colonies of microorganisms from patient specimens are grown  or cultured  in various growth media 
following colony growth  various direct and indirect techniques are utilized to determine the identity and  as required  the sensitivity of the microorganism to specific antibiotics 
using currently available technologies  the entire process may take days or weeks to complete 
in the meantime  a patient requiring immediate therapy  must often be treated by the clinician based upon the best clinical facts available at that time 
upon receipt of the diagnostic analysis from the laboratory  the initial patient treatment protocol may need to be modified in order to treat the patient more effectively 
current culture based methods detect a single microorganism at one time 
because a particular infectious episode may be caused by one of many microorganisms or several microorganisms together  multiple tests may be required to determine the correct diagnosis 
single tube one at a time dna probe diagnostics  which were first introduced to the marketplace in the mid s  have been unsuccessful in displacing culture based diagnostic tests in part due to their inability to identify several organisms simultaneously 
our technology addresses these shortcomings by allowing the simultaneous analysis of multiple microorganisms from a single patient sample 
we believe our technology and integrated system may speed the time to result for diagnostic tests and offer our customers the opportunity to lower their costs and improve productivity by automating all or a significant portion of their labor intensive testing 
in september  we entered into a collaboration agreement with prodesse  inc to develop automated  highly sensitive microarray products to detect a number of infectious disease agents  including influenza adenovirus  herpes  west nile virus  and sars 
the collaboration will integrate prodesse s proprietary multiplex amplification technology with the automated nanochip and jointly develop and market gene based testing products to health care and clinical reference labs 
most infectious disease diagnostics are culture based and labs often take a week or longer to produce results 
consequently  physicians frequently prescribe antibiotics or antivirals prior to determining the exact pathogen causing the infection 
by combining prodesse s pathogen detecting products with the nanochip molecular biology workstation  the company expects to be able to offer reagents for the development of an automated process for testing patient samples within hours  enabling physicians to obtain results and prescribe therapeutics in response to test results 
the company believes that this should help reduce inappropriate treatment with antibiotics  the overuse of which has resulted in an increase in antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria and a decrease in the effectiveness of many commonly prescribed antibiotics 
prodesse currently offers six different multiplex products that can be used to detect a total of different pathogens  and it expects to release five more products with an additional targets 
the company s technology amplifies the sequences for many different pathogens  simultaneously with virtually no lose of sensitivity and with no cross reactivity  which is important for obtaining of precise test results 
asrs for genes related to epilepsy in  nanogen entered into a development site agreement with bionomics  an australian company that provides for an option to the exclusive commercial rights for certain gene mutations believed to relate to epilepsy 
this agreement was extended and modified in bionomics is currently in the initial stage of validating its hypothesis and developing a test for these mutations 
since this research is in the early stage of development  no definitive time table has been set for the release of any of such asrs 
if asrs or fda cleared products are brought to market  bionomics will market such products in australia and new zealand and nanogen will market products to the remainder of the world 

table of contents advanced technology and research and development besides the continued development of the nanochip system  asrs and other similar products  we are currently conducting research and development into a number of other applications of our technology 
developing advanced technologies  nanotechnology and point of care applications in the long term  we plan to develop sample to answer systems which integrate otherwise time consuming and labor intensive sample preparation procedures on the disposable cartridge through the use of active microelectronics 
the availability of this lab on a chip technology would fulfill a substantial unmet need in both academic research and commercial sectors 
biodefense nanogen began work on biodefense related technology for the united states government in the work has expanded to include three current government grants to support biowarfare detection efforts one ongoing darpa grant and two dust grants 
specific development efforts include a prototype portable field based detection device and an integrated micro laboratory and assay protocol to analyze simulated biowarfare targets 
also under development are assays aimed at detection of specific biowarfare agents and infectious diseases and a self contained portable system capable of performing on chip non pcr amplification and detection of potential biowarfare threats 
nanotechnology as of december   nanogen had been issued six key nanotechnology patents that relate to the electronic fabrication of micro and nanoscale devices 
in may  nanogen received us patent no 
 method and apparatus for the electronic  homogenous assembly and fabrication of devices 
the patent relates to methods to integrate micro and nanoscale devices as light emitting diodes led for displays  highly integrated biosensors and micromechanical devices  into higher order structures and devices 
in november  nanogen received us patent no 
 methods for the electronic assembly and fabrication of devices 
the patent relates to a nanofabrication technology that combines an electric field assisted manufacturing platform and programmable self assembling nanostructures for example  dna building blocks for the fabrication of a wide range of unique higher order nano and microscale devices  structures and materials 
subsequently  in march the company was issued another key nanotechnology patent  us patent no 
 systems and devices for photoelectrophoretic transport and hybridization of oligonucleotides  by the us patent and trademark office 
the patent relates to new devices for nanofabrication that enable the photoelectric transport and positioning of self assembling dna nanostructures and microstructures on a semiconductor substrate material 
these devices use directed light beams to create precise electric fields on the substrate material 
charged nanostructures such as dna derivatized nanoparticles are transported to the electric field site where they become attached and can then lead to the further self organization of higher order nanoscale or microscale structures and devices 
nanogen s proprietary nanotechnology may provide a technological foundation for the effective use of nanocomponents in many diverse applications 
it is the current intention of nanogen to realize value from our nanotechnology patents through use in biomedical applications or through licensing or partnering opportunities 
forensics strs are the genetic sequences chosen by the us government and various foreign governments to populate their national criminal identification databases 
some foreign researchers and governments are also beginning to examine certain snps to develop such databases 
these databases are intended to provide nationwide tools for identifying repeat criminals by comparing a given piece of evidence or sample from a suspect with the sequences stored in the database 
currently  we have four overseas development sites working on forensic applications 
we believe our nanochip system may be useful in human identity testing 

table of contents our research collaborations in the area of forensic applications include identity testing and have allowed us to further develop existing technology and explore new technology 
prior and current grants from the national institute of justice have involved sponsored research for forensic applications  such as the development of a portable system for human identification at the crime scene and the development of on chip non pcr amplification 
nanogen recognomics nanogen recognomics  a joint venture of nanogen and aventis pharma deutchland  gmbh formerly aventis research and technologies  combines the nanochip technology and aventis intellectual property and expertise in synthetic oligonucleotide chemistry and advanced molecular biology to develop new products and applications for the nanochip system 
besides assisting us in the development of asrs for the detection of genes associated with canavan disease  their research efforts have included genetic based in vitro human detection  diagnostics  screening and monitoring applications  including research into novel oligonucleotide chemistries 
the shareholders of nanogen recognomics have recently decided to convert nanogen recognomics into a non operating holding company to attempt to commercialize its intellectual property through licensing and sale transactions 
other potential applications as the human genome project opportunity and other public and private genetic sequencing efforts yield increasing amounts of genetic information  we believe that the demand for genetic predisposition testing will continue to grow 
because many important genetic diseases are ideally suited to diagnosis in multiplexed arrays  we believe that our technology platform could contribute significantly to the expansion of testing in this area 
while our development efforts in this area with respect to specific genetic tests are still at an early stage  our core technology platform for other diagnostic applications may be well suited for these opportunities 
pharmacogenomics we believe that the ability of our technology to screen simultaneously for various dna sequences and the ability to differentiate between snps has potentially wide applicability to the field of genetic testing in general and pharmacogenomics in particular 
pharmacogenomics is the science of individualizing therapy based on genetic differences among patients 
our nanochip system may provide pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies with the ability to identify important genetic variations early in the drug development process 
we believe our system may help stratify patients during clinical trials and identify those receiving the maximum benefit from treatment 
collaborative alliances we intend to continue to enter into collaborations to expand applications of our technology platform and to accelerate the commercialization of products 
we will pursue additional collaborations in various forms  including research and development agreements  licensing agreements and joint ventures 
these collaborations permit integration of the technology and resources of our partners with our technology  while allowing nanogen to pursue diagnostics  drug discovery and genomics opportunities outside the scope of these collaborations 
we are currently involved in several material corporate collaborations 
in july  we formed a company with aventis named nanogen recognomics gmbh 
in january  we entered into a manufacturing  development and distribution agreement with hitachi  ltd 
in july  we entered into an additional agreement with hitachi  ltd  nissei sangyo co 
ltd 
and hitachi instruments service co 
ltd 
of japan collectively  hitachi to develop  manufacture and distribute additional potential products based on the parties proprietary technologies  potentially including  among other things  reduced size instruments for genetic testing  integrated amplification and point of care detection 
in july we entered into another manufacturing agreement with hitachi relating to the manufacture of our next generation system 

table of contents during the third quarter of  nanogen entered into a collaboration agreement with prodesse  inc  a biotechnology company focused on developing asrs that can be used by clia certified laboratories to detect infectious pathogens 
the company believes that the products developed with prodesse will enable physicians to immediately select and initiate appropriate therapy for patients 
aventis nanogen recognomics in december  we entered into a letter agreement with aventis for an exclusive research and development collaboration relating to new drug discovery tools and immunodiagnostics research 
in connection with the letter agreement  we entered into a definitive collaborative research and development agreement with an effective date of january  the term of this original collaboration agreement expired at the end of in september we entered into an additional collaboration agreement with aventis that involved two new research and development programs focused on gene expression arrays and on an electronics based high throughput screening system 
we retain full commercialization rights for any products resulting from these new projects  while aventis retains the right to use the technology for internal research and development 
the september agreement expired at the end of we do not expect to receive additional funding for these projects 
in july  we formed a company with aventis named nanogen recognomics gmbh 
this company was formed to allow us to benefit from the development of new technological advances for our platform while we are still focusing on our near term goal of entry into molecular diagnostics 
nanogen recognomics adds intellectual property and expertise in synthetic oligonucleotide chemistry and advanced molecular biology to nanogen 
as described earlier herein  nanogen recognomics combines the nanochip technology and aventis intellectual property and expertise in synthetic oligonucleotide chemistry and advanced molecular biology to develop new products and applications for the nanochip system 
the shareholders of nanogen recognomics have recently decided to convert nanogen recognomics into a non operating holding company to attempt to commercialize its intellectual property through licensing and sale transactions 
hitachi manufacturing agreements in january  the company executed an agreement with hitachi  ltd  effective as of december   for the full scale commercial manufacturing and distribution of the nanochip molecular biology workstation in specified research markets 
hitachi  ltd 
s instrument group provides technology and technical support to aid in the manufacturing of the nanochip molecular biology workstation s components 
pursuant to the agreement  hitachi  ltd 
has the right to be the sole distributor of nanochip molecular biology workstations in japan 
hitachi  ltd 
also has the non exclusive right to distribute nanochip cartridges in japan 
under this arrangement  the company receives a royalty for nanochip molecular biology workstations sold by hitachi  ltd 
in japan 
the company retained the right to distribute  directly or through others  nanochip molecular biology workstations outside of japan 
in addition  the company manufactures nanochip cartridges at its san diego  california facility for distribution worldwide 
the company also retained the right to form other manufacturing and distribution agreements 
pursuant to our manufacturing agreement with hitachi  the company is required to provide annual purchase commitments to hitachi for nanochip workstations 
in june  the company entered into another manufacturing agreement with hitachi for the manufacture of a new clinical instrument being developed under the collaborative research agreement described below 
pursuant to the manufacturing agreement  hitachi will manufacture the new clinical instrument  when development is completed  exclusively for the company for worldwide distribution 
once production instruments are received by the company  the company is required to meet certain annual purchase commitments for the new instrument 

table of contents research collaboration agreement in july  the company executed a ten year agreement with hitachi  ltd  nissei sangyo co 
ltd 
and hitachi instruments service co 
ltd 
of japan collectively  hitachi to develop  manufacture and distribute additional potential products based on the parties proprietary technologies  potentially including  among other things  reduced size instruments for genetic testing  integrated amplification and point of care detection 
the agreement provides that the parties will jointly determine which projects to prioritize over the term of the agreement 
the agreement may be terminated before its expiration by either party  subject to certain restrictions 
pursuant to the terms of the agreement  hitachi and the company each may contribute  toward the research and development efforts of the company  up to million in cash over the ten year period 
at a minimum  the company is required to contribute on an annual basis funding for its own general technology development in an amount equal to or greater than payments made by hitachi 
in addition  the company is liable to repay to hitachi fifty percent of all funding provided by hitachi over an indefinite period of time 
repayment amounts are determined as a percentage of the company s gross nanochip cartridge sales until the liability is paid in full 
furthermore  hitachi made an equity investment in the company by purchasing  shares of the company s common stock worth approximately million pursuant to a private sale by the company based on a per share price of the fair market value as of the signing date of the hitachi agreement 
hitachi has the right to be the exclusive distributor of collaboration products in japan and  based upon the attainment of minimum sales targets to be mutually agreed upon  in other asian countries 
the company retains the exclusive right to distribute collaboration products outside of these countries 
in august  the company received written notice from hitachi to exercise its right to terminate the collaborative research agreement in accordance with the terms of the agreement 
hitachi s exercise of its right to terminate this agreement does not accelerate the repayment due hitachi for the fifty percent of hitachi provided funding 
neither nanogen nor hitachi has terminated any of the other agreements between the companies 
based on joint discussions  nanogen and hitachi have determined to focus their joint efforts on the development and manufacture of a new clinical instrument 
nanogen and hitachi will continue to be jointly responsible for development of the new clinical instrument 
hitachi is responsible for world wide manufacturing of the instrument 
nanogen is responsible for development of assays and for marketing and sales except in japan 
service agreement in november  the company entered into an amendment to an agreement with hitachi signed in october for the service by hitachi of the nanochip molecular biology workstations in the united states after sale or placement by the company with the company s customers 
the agreement modified the agreed upon amount the company pays to hitachi for annual service for each workstation covered under the agreement 
government grants in  we continued work under a number of biodefense related technology grants for the united states government 
the work has expanded to include three current government grants to support biowarfare detection efforts one ongoing darpa grant and two dust grants in the latter part of  we received an additional million grant from the national institute of justice nij to continue an earlier nij grant for the development of a forensics detection system for the identification of certain relevant snps and strs and we received a grant from the national institute of health for  for the development of a sample preparation system for the detection of certain biological agents 
specific development efforts include a prototype portable field based detection device and an integrated micro laboratory and assay protocol to analyze simulated biowarfare targets 
also under development are assays aimed at detection of specific biowarfare agents and infectious diseases and a self contained portable system capable of performing on chip non pcr amplification and detection of potential biowarfare threats 
also  in  we received phase ii and phase iii grants totaling approximately  from the national institutes of health to develop on chip sda amplification techniques 

table of contents we believe that the actions we are taking to develop our product platform for use in molecular diagnostics are directly portable and complementary to what we are doing in the biowarfare arena for the us army and for the nih 
as a result  we believe that our government and commercial programs complement one another 
proprietary technology and patents as of december   we have issued us patents and foreign patents and a number of pending patent applications filed in the us and abroad 
in addition to pursuing patents and patent applications relating to our platform technology  we have and may enter into other license arrangements to obtain rights to third party intellectual property where appropriate 
our  or our licensors patent applications may not be issued 
issued patents may not be found valid if challenged 
in addition  intellectual property rights licensed by us may not be successfully integrated into commercial products 
others may independently develop similar technologies or duplicate any technology developed by us 
because of the extensive time required for development  testing  and regulatory review of a potential product  it is possible that  before any of our products can be commercialized  any related patent may expire or remain in existence for only a short period following commercialization  thus reducing any advantage of the patent  which could adversely affect our ability to protect future product development and  consequently  our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we seek to protect our inventions through filing us patents and foreign counterpart applications in selected other countries 
because patent applications in the us are maintained in secrecy for at least eighteen months after the applications are filed and since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries  we cannot be certain that we were the first to make the inventions covered by each of our issued or pending patent applications or that we were the first to file for protection of inventions set forth in such patent applications 
our planned or potential products may be covered by third party patents or other intellectual property rights  in which case continued development and marketing of the products would require a license 
required licenses may not be available to us on commercially acceptable terms  if at all 
if we do not obtain these licenses  we could encounter delays in product introductions while we attempt to design around the patents  or could find that the development  manufacture or sale of products requiring these licenses is foreclosed 
we are aware of us and european patents and patent applications owned by oxford gene technology ogt 
we have opposed one allowed european patent that had broad claims to array technology for analyzing a predetermined polynucleotide sequence 
ogt s position with respect to the opposed patent is that the claims relate to what it terms the diagnostic mode 
those claims have now been narrowed before the opposition division to the point that  if these claims remain final before the european patent office  we believe they would not be infringed by our technology 
in the oral proceedings before the opposition division on november   and   the division determined that the claims language must be limited to arrays with smooth  impermeable surfaces 
the case is currently on appeal 
if the decision of the opposition division is successfully appealed by ogt and the original claims are reinstated  or if an application relating to arrays issued in another country with claims as broad as the original european patent  we could be subject to infringement accusations that could delay or preclude sales of some or all of our anticipated diagnostic products 
in addition to the patent litigation described in item herein  other litigation may be necessary to defend against or assert claims of infringement  to enforce patents issued to us  to protect trade secrets or know how owned by us or to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others 
in addition  interference proceedings declared by the us patent and trademark office may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions with respect to our patent applications 
litigation or interference proceedings could result in substantial costs to and diversion of our effort  and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
any such efforts may not be successful 

table of contents we may rely on trade secrets to protect our technology 
trade secrets are difficult to protect 
we seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes by confidentiality agreements with our employees and certain consultants and contractors 
these agreements may be breached  we may not have adequate remedies for any breach and our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors 
to the extent that our employees or our consultants or contractors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us  disputes may also arise as to the rights in related or resulting know how and inventions 
manufacturing in january  we formed a collaboration with hitachi for the manufacture of our nanochip molecular biology workstation instruments 
in july  we executed a ten year agreement with hitachi  ltd  nissei sangyo co 
ltd 
and hitachi instruments service co 
ltd 
of japan to develop  manufacture and distribute products based on the parties proprietary technologies 
for the manufacture of the nanochip cartridge  we perform many of the proprietary assembly steps in house 
in june  the company entered into another manufacturing agreement with hitachi for the manufacture of a new clinical instrument being developed under the collaborative research agreement described below 
pursuant to the manufacturing agreement  hitachi will manufacture the new clinical instrument  when development is completed  exclusively for the company for worldwide distribution 
once production instruments are received by the company  the company is required to meet certain annual purchase commitments for the new instrument 
we believe our technology allows for large scale microchip production at a relatively low cost 
we believe that the implementation of this scalability and low cost will help promote the rapid acceptance of our proprietary semiconductor based platform technology as an industry standard 
however  achieving these efficiencies will require substantial commercial volumes and there can be no assurance we will be successful in generating sufficient demand to scale up manufacturing capacity to levels that will allow our products to be priced competitively 
sales and marketing we began commercializing the nanochip molecular biology workstation during the latter part of since then  we have built a commercial structure that allows us to sell directly in certain markets  while selling through distributors and partners in other markets 
we began selling our first asrs in our commercial organization includes direct sales representatives and sales management  customer support personnel  field support personnel and marketing 
we began selling our product in to customers in the united states  canada  mexico and several european countries 
to support the commercial efforts in europe  in august we established nanogen europe bv  a company with limited liability  in the netherlands 
this wholly owned subsidiary operates as our primary european sales and marketing office 
hitachi s distribution company  hitachi high technologies  began distributing our product in japan during the latter part of as well 
in january  we entered into a distribution agreement with transgenomic inc for distribution of our products in certain european countries 
we expect to augment our commercial selling process by adding additional distributor partners in other countries 
in san diego  we support world wide field activities with a customer applications laboratory 
this laboratory is used to assist in early customer demonstrations  protocol development and system and applications training 
competition as we develop applications of our technology  we expect to encounter intense competition from a number of companies that offer products competing in our targeted applications 
the molecular diagnostic test market  in particular  is highly competitive  and we expect the intensity of competition to increase 
we anticipate that our competitors will include health care companies that manufacture laboratory based tests and analyzers  diagnostic and pharmaceutical companies  as well as companies developing drug discovery technologies 
to the extent we are successful in developing products in these areas  we will face competition from established and development stage companies both in the united states and abroad 

table of contents in many instances  our competitors have substantially greater financial  technical  research  and other resources and larger  more established marketing  sales  distribution and service organizations than we 
moreover  competitors may offer broader product lines and have greater name recognition than we  and may offer discounts as a competitive tactic 
in addition  several development stage companies are making or developing products that compete with our potential products 
there can be no assurance that our competitors will not succeed in developing or marketing technologies or products that are more effective or commercially attractive than our potential products  or that would render our technologies and products obsolete 
also  we may not have the financial resources  technical expertise or marketing  distribution or support capabilities to compete successfully in the future 
our success will depend in large part on our ability to maintain a competitive position with respect to our technologies 
rapid technological development by others may also result in competing products or technologies 
government regulation currently our nanochip system is marketed for the detection of known sequences in the us and primarily distributed for research use in europe 
the asrs under development and commercially available are manufactured and distributed in the us pursuant to cfr which delineates the class ii and iii asrs  and otherwise exempts from the k pma requirements asrs distributed to in vitro diagnostic manufacturers or organizations that use the reagents to make tests for purposes other than providing diagnostic information to patients and practitioners and cfr which places limitations on the distribution  labeling  advertising  and promotion of asrs 
future short term plans include distribution of these reagents for research use in europe with eventual ce marking of the next generation system under the european ivdmdd regulations 
for our initial commercial markets  the biomedical research market and the high complexity clia certified laboratory market  we may not need fda or other regulatory clearances for our nanochip system and certain asrs prior to marketing 
the fda has recently communicated  however  that certain microarray devices that qualify as asrs by regulation  may nonetheless lose their class i  k exempt status by operation of other provisions of the federal food  drug and cosmetic act usc and fda regulations cfr  cfr  if the microarray is intended for a use which is of substantial importance in preventing impairment of human health or it presents a potential unreasonable risk of illness or injury 
it is unclear what the impact of these fda communications and determinations will be on nanogen and its current and future products 
we have not applied for fda or other regulatory clearances with respect to any of our products under development 
we anticipate  however  that the manufacturing  labeling  distribution and marketing of some or all of the diagnostic products we may develop and seek to commercialize in the future will be subject to regulation in the us and in other countries 
in addition to clinical diagnostic markets  we also may pursue forensic  agricultural  environmental  laboratory and industrial applications for our products which may be subject to different government regulation 
aspects of our manufacturing and marketing activities may also be subject to federal  state and local regulation by various governmental authorities 
in the us  the fda regulates  as medical devices  most diagnostic tests and in vitro reagents that are marketed as finished test kits and equipment 
pursuant to the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act  and the regulations promulgated thereunder  the fda regulates the preclinical and clinical testing  design  manufacture  labeling  distribution and promotion of medical devices 
we will not be able to commence marketing or commercial sales in the us of our new medical devices that require pre market authorization until we receive clearance or approval from the fda  which can be a lengthy  expensive  and uncertain process 
noncompliance with applicable requirements can result in  among other things  warning letters  administrative or judicially imposed sanctions such as injunctions  civil penalties  recall or seizure of products  total or partial suspension of production  failure of the government to grant premarket clearance k or premarket approval pma for devices  withdrawal of marketing clearances or approvals  or criminal prosecution 
in the us  medical devices are generally classified into one of three classes ie  class i  ii or iii on the basis of the controls deemed necessary by the fda to reasonably ensure the safety and effectiveness of the product 

table of contents generally  class i devices are subject to general controls eg  labeling  postmarket controls  medical device reporting and adherence to quality system regulations  or qsr 
generally  class ii devices are subject to general and special controls eg  performance standards  premarket notification and postmarket surveillance 
generally  class iii devices are new technology or high risk devices which must receive premarket approval by the fda to ensure their safety and effectiveness eg  life sustaining  life supporting  and implantable devices or new devices which have been found not to be substantially equivalent to legally marketed devices 
before a device can be introduced in the market  the manufacturer must generally obtain fda clearance of a k notification or approval of a pma application 
our products will vary significantly in the degree of regulatory approvals required 
we believe that certain of our products labeled for research  genomics  drug discovery and industrial applications may not require regulatory approvals or clearance 
some in vitro diagnostic products will require k clearances  while other diagnostic and genetic testing products will require pma approvals 
a k clearance will generally only be granted if the information submitted to the fda establishes that the device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed predicate device 
for any devices that are cleared through the k process  significant modifications or enhancements in the design or intended use that could significantly affect safety or effectiveness will require new k submissions 
it generally takes at least three to six months or more from submission to obtain k premarket clearance  but the process may take longer if fda requests more data or research 
the fda may determine that we must adhere to the more costly  lengthy  and burdensome pma approval process for our potential products 
the premarket approval pma application process is more expensive  burdensome  and lengthy than the k clearance process 
a pma must establish the safety and effectiveness of the device to the fda s satisfaction  which typically requires extensive data  including but not limited to  technical  preclinical  clinical trials  manufacturing and labeling to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the device 
although clinical investigations of most devices are subject to the investigational device exemption requirements  clinical investigations of non significant risk in vitro diagnostic tests  such as certain of our products and products under development  are exempt from the investigational device exemption ide requirements  including the need to obtain the fda s prior approval 
we believe certain of our diagnostics are non significant risk devices because the testing is noninvasive  does not require an invasive sampling procedure that presents a significant risk  does not introduce energy into the subject  and is not used as a diagnostic procedure without confirmation by another medically established test or procedure 
to fall within this exemption to the ide requirement  the in vitro diagnostic tests must be labeled for research use only or investigational use only  and distribution and due diligence controls must be established by the company to assure that ivds distributed for research or clinical investigation are used only for those purposes 
after a pma is accepted for filing  the fda begins its review of the submitted information  which generally takes between one and two years 
during this review period  the fda may request additional information or clarification of information already provided  as well as conduct a pre approval inspection of the manufacturing facility 
if we are not in compliance with quality system regulations qsrs applicable to manufacturing  we will not receive pma approval 
also during the review period  an advisory panel of experts from outside the fda will be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the fda as to the approvability of the device 
significant modifications to the design  labeling or manufacturing process of a pma approved device may require approval by the fda of a pma supplement 
we may not be able to obtain necessary approvals on a timely basis  if at all  and delays in obtaining or failure to obtain such approvals  the loss of previously obtained approvals  or failure to comply with existing or future regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
manufacturers of medical devices marketed in the us are required to adhere to the qsr requirements formerly good manufacturing practices  which include testing  control and documentation requirements 
manufacturers must also comply with medical device reporting requirements that a manufacturer report to the fda any incident in which its product may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury  or in which its product malfunctioned and would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury upon recurrence 

table of contents medical device labeling and promotional activities are subject to scrutiny by the fda and  in many circumstances  by the federal trade commission 
fda enforcement policy prohibits the marketing of unapproved devices or marketing approved medical devices for unapproved uses 
we may become subject to routine inspection by the fda and certain state agencies for compliance with qsr requirements  medical device reporting requirements and other applicable regulations and state equivalent requirements 
the qsr requirements include design controls for which there is a relatively high cost of compliance 
we may incur significant costs to comply with laws and regulations in the future and these laws and regulations may have a material adverse effect upon our business  financial condition and results of operation 
any of our customers using our potential future diagnostic devices for clinical use in the us may be regulated under the clinical laboratory improvement act of clia 
clia is intended to ensure the quality and reliability of clinical laboratories in the us by mandating specific standards in the areas of personnel qualification  administration  participation in proficiency testing  patient test management  quality control  quality assurance and inspections 
the regulations promulgated under clia establish three levels of diagnostic tests waived  moderately complex and highly complex  and the standards applicable to a clinical laboratory depend on the level of the tests it performs 
clia requirements may prevent some clinical laboratories from using our diagnostic products 
therefore  clia regulations and future administrative interpretations of clia may have a material adverse impact on us by limiting the potential market for our products 
there can be no assurance that new legislation will not impose additional costs or lengthen review times for our products 
additionally  should we develop food pathogen products  they will be subject to the regulations of various domestic and foreign government agencies which regulate food safety and food adulteration  including the us department of agriculture 
employees as of december   we had full time employees and part time employee  of whom hold phd degrees and hold other advanced degrees 
approximately are involved in research and development  in operations  manufacturing and quality assurance  in sales and marketing  and in finance  legal and other administrative functions 
our success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain employees 
we face competition in this regard from other companies  research and academic institutions  government entities and other organizations 
none of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement 
factors that may affect results if our products are not successfully developed or commercialized  we could be forced to curtail or cease operations 
we are at an early stage of development 
as of december   we had only a limited product offering that includes our nanochip system which consists of our nanochip molecular biology workstation and nanochip cartridge  nanochip cartridge  five asrs  assay toolbox and a product available only in europe solely for research use for beta thalasemia 
all of our other platforms and asrs and other potential products are under development 
our nanochip system  asrs or our other products may not be successfully developed or commercialized on a timely basis  or at all 
if we are unable  for technological or other reasons  to complete the development  introduction or scale up of manufacturing of our new products  or if our products do not achieve a significant level of market acceptance  we would be forced to curtail or cease operations 

table of contents as of december  we have placed a total of nanochip systems 
this includes instruments we have placed at various customer sites under development or strategic site agreements whereby title of the nanochip molecular biology workstation did not pass to the customer and therefore no revenue was recognized 
we are also party to transactions known as reagent rentals and cost per test agreements 
under these types of transactions  we place a workstation at a customer site with no upfront cost to the customer 
the value of the instrument is typically recaptured through a contracted stream of future reagent sales  sold at a premium to cover the cost of the system 
many of our reagent rentals and cost per test agreements entered into as of december  require customer acceptance of our cftr asrs as a pre condition to the customer s commitment to purchase the instrument 
our cftr asrs may be utilized by customers to develop and validate tests for the detection of mutations in the cftr gene associated with cystic fibrosis 
these reagent rentals and cost per test agreements might have an adverse impact on our short term instrument sales revenue and cash flow as the revenues and cash received under these agreements are over the life of the contract  as reagents are shipped to the customer 
our success will depend upon our ability to continue to overcome significant technological challenges and successfully introduce our products into the marketplace 
a number of applications envisioned by us may require significant enhancements to our basic technology platform 
there can be no assurance that we can successfully develop such enhancements 
lack of market acceptance of our technology would harm us 
although we have developed a number of products as discussed above  we may not be able to further develop these products or to develop other commercially viable products 
even if we develop a product  it may not be accepted in the marketplace 
if we are unable to achieve market acceptance  we will not be able to generate sufficient product revenue to become profitable 
we may also be forced to carry greater inventories of our products for longer periods than we may have anticipated 
if we are unable to sell the inventory of our products in a timely fashion and at anticipated price levels  we may not become profitable 
in addition  we may have to take accounting charges and reduce the value of our product inventory to its net realizable value 
in september we took an accounting charge of  to reduce product inventory to its estimated net realizable value 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by us  additional inventory write downs may be required 
market acceptance will depend on many factors  including our ability to convince prospective strategic partners and customers that our technology is an attractive alternative to other technologies  manufacture products in sufficient quantities with acceptable quality and at an acceptable cost  and sell  place and service sufficient quantities of our products 
in addition  our technology platform could be harmed by limited funding available for product and technology acquisitions by our customers  internal obstacles to customer approvals of purchases of our products and market conditions in general 
commercialization of some of our potential products depends on collaborations with others 
if our collaborators are not successful or if we are unable to find collaborators in the future  we may not be able to develop these products 
our strategy for the research  development and commercialization of some of our products requires us to enter into contractual arrangements with corporate collaborators  joint venture partners  licensors  licensees and others 
our success depends in part upon the performance by these collaboration partners and potential collaboration partners of their responsibilities under these arrangements 
some collaborators may not perform their obligations as we expect  and we may not derive any revenue or other benefits from these arrangements 
we do not know whether our collaborations will successfully develop and market any products under our respective agreements 
moreover  some of our collaborators are also researching competing technologies targeted by our collaborative programs 

table of contents in august  hitachi  ltd 
exercised its right to terminate the research collaboration agreement it has with us 
the agreement is scheduled to terminate during the second quarter of until the agreement terminates  we and hitachi expect to continue to work on the development of a new clinical instrument 
our manufacturing and distribution agreements with hitachi remain in place 
in june  we formed a new company  nanogen recognomics gmbh  with aventis research and technologies co 
kg  in which we own of the stock of nanogen recognomics and aventis r t owns the remaining 
nanogen recognomics seeks to combine our nanochip technology and aventis r t s intellectual property and expertise in synthetic oligonucleotide chemistry and advanced molecular biology to develop new products and applications for the nanochip system 
in february  the shareholders of nanogen recognomics decided to convert nanogen recognomics into a non operating holding company to attempt to commercialize its intellectual property through licensing and sales transactions 
we may be unsuccessful in entering into other collaborative arrangements to develop and commercialize our products 
in addition  disputes may arise over ownership rights to intellectual property  know how or technologies developed with our collaborators 
we have a history of net losses 
we expect to continue to incur net losses and we may not achieve or maintain profitability 
since our inception  we have incurred cumulative net losses which  as of december   total approximately million 
moreover  our negative cash flow and losses from operations will continue for the foreseeable future 
we may never generate sufficient product revenue to become profitable 
we also expect to have quarter to quarter fluctuations in revenues  expenses and losses  which fluctuations could be significant 
the amount and timing of product revenue recognition and cash flow may depend on whether potential customers for the nanochip system choose to enter into sales  reagent rentals  cost per test or development site transactions 
to develop and sell our products successfully  we may need to increase our spending levels in research and development  as well as in selling  marketing and administration 
we may have to incur these increased spending levels before knowing whether our products can be sold successfully 
we will need additional capital in the future 
if additional capital is not available  we may have to curtail or cease operations 
we will need to raise more money to continue the research and development necessary to further develop our current products to bring our products to market and to further our manufacturing and marketing capabilities 
we may seek additional funds through public and private stock offerings  arrangements with corporate partners  borrowings under lease lines of credit or other sources 
if we cannot raise more money  we will have to reduce our capital expenditures  scale back our development of new products  reduce our workforce and seek to license to others products or technologies that we otherwise would seek to commercialize ourselves 
the amount of money we will need will depend on many factors  including among others the progress of our research and development programs  the commercial arrangements we may establish  the time and costs involved in scaling up our manufacturing capabilities  meeting regulatory requirements  including meeting necessary quality system regulations or qsrs and obtaining necessary regulatory clearances or approvals  filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent claims and litigation  and the scope and results of our future clinical trials  if any 

table of contents additional capital may not be available on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
any additional equity financing would likely be dilutive to stockholders  and debt financing  if available  may include restrictive covenants and require significant collateral 
competing technologies may adversely affect us 
we expect to encounter intense competition from a number of companies that offer products in our targeted application areas 
we anticipate that our competitors in these areas will include health care and other companies that manufacture laboratory based tests and analyzers  diagnostic and pharmaceutical companies  companies developing drug discovery technologies  and companies developing molecular diagnostic tests 
if we are successful in developing products in these areas  we will face competition from established companies and numerous development stage companies that continually enter these markets 
in many instances  our competitors have substantially greater financial  technical  research and other resources and larger  more established marketing  sales  distribution and service organizations than us 
moreover  these competitors may offer broader product lines and have greater name recognition than us and may offer discounts as a competitive tactic 
in addition  several development stage companies are currently making or developing products that compete with or will compete with our potential products 
our competitors may succeed in developing  obtaining approval from the us food and drug administration or marketing technologies or products that are more effective or commercially attractive than our current or potential products or that render our technologies and current or potential products obsolete 
as these companies develop their technologies  they may develop proprietary positions that may prevent us from successfully commercializing products 
also  we may not have the financial resources  technical expertise or marketing  distribution or support capabilities to compete successfully in the future 
the uncertainty of patent and proprietary technology protection may adversely affect us 
our success will depend in part on obtaining and maintaining meaningful patent protection on our inventions  technologies and discoveries 
our ability to compete effectively will depend on our ability to develop and maintain proprietary aspects of our technology  and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others  or to obtain rights to third party proprietary rights  if necessary 
our pending patent applications may not result in the issuance of patents 
our patent applications may not have priority over others applications  and even if issued  our patents may not offer protection against competitors with similar technologies 
any patents issued to us may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  and the rights created thereunder may not afford us a competitive advantage 
we also rely upon trade secrets  technical know how and continuing inventions to develop and maintain our competitive position 
others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our technology and we may not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets  or be capable of protecting our rights to our trade secrets 
we seek to protect our technology and patents  in part  by confidentiality agreements with our employees and contractors 
our employees may breach their existing proprietary information  inventions  and dispute resolution agreements and these agreements may not protect our intellectual property 
this could have a material adverse effect on us 

table of contents our products could infringe on the intellectual property rights of others  which may subject us to future litigation and cause us to be unable to license technology from third parties 
our commercial success also depends in part on us neither infringing valid  enforceable patents or proprietary rights of third parties  nor breaching any licenses that may relate to our technologies and products 
we are aware of other third party patents that may relate to our technology 
it is possible that we may unintentionally infringe these patents or other patents or proprietary rights of third parties 
we may in the future receive notices claiming infringement from third parties as well as invitations to take licenses under third party patents 
any legal action against us or our collaborative partners claiming damages and seeking to enjoin commercial activities relating to our products and processes affected by third party rights may require us or our collaborative partners to obtain licenses in order to continue to manufacture or market the affected products and processes 
in addition  these actions may subject us to potential liability for damages 
we or our collaborative partners may not prevail in an action and any license required under a patent may not be made available on commercially acceptable terms  or at all 
there are many us and foreign patents and patent applications held by third parties in our areas of interest  and we believe that there may be significant other litigation in the industry regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
additional litigation could result in substantial costs and the diversion of management s efforts regardless of the result of the litigation 
additionally  the defense and prosecution of interference proceedings before the us patent and trademark office  or uspto  and related administrative proceedings would result in substantial expense to us and significant diversion of effort by our technical and management personnel 
we may in the future become subject to uspto interference proceedings to determine the priority of inventions 
in addition  laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property to the same extent as do laws in the us  which may subject us to additional difficulties in protecting our intellectual property in those countries 
we are aware of us and european patents and patent applications owned by oxford gene technologies 
we have opposed one allowed european patent that had broad claims to array technology for analyzing a predetermined polynucleotide sequence 
oxford gene s position with respect to the opposed patent is that the claims relate to what it terms the diagnostic mode 
those claims have now been narrowed before the opposition division of the european patent office to the point that  if these claims remain final before the european patent office  we believe they would not be infringed by our technology 
in the oral proceedings before the opposition division on november   and   the division determined that the claims language must be limited to arrays with smooth  impermeable surfaces 
the case is currently on appeal 
if the decision of the opposition division is successfully appealed by oxford gene and the original claims are reinstated  or if an application relating to arrays is issued in another country with claims as broad as the original european patent  we could be subject to infringement accusations that could delay or preclude sales of some or all of our anticipated diagnostic products 
we may continue to be involved in intellectual property litigation that may be costly  time consuming and may impact our competitive position 
in december  oxford gene technologies filed a complaint against us in the united states district court for the district of delaware claiming that we infringe us patent no 
 entitled analytical polynucleotide sequences 
in april  we filed an answer to the complaint that denied that we infringe this patent 
in october  we entered into a settlement agreement with oxford gene technologies pursuant to which the lawsuit was dismissed by oxford gene technology without prejudice 
if the litigation were to be reinitiated  significant attorneys costs and fees could result 
although it is our position that oxford gene s assertions of infringement have no merit  neither the outcome of any further litigation nor the amount and range of potential fees can be assessed 
no assurances can be given that we would prevail in any future lawsuits or that we could successfully defend ourselves against any future claims 

table of contents the regulatory approval process is expensive  time consuming  uncertain and may prevent us from obtaining required approvals for the commercialization of our products 
the manufacturing  labeling  distribution and marketing of any diagnostic products we may develop will be subject to regulation in the us and other countries 
these regulations could subject us to several problems such as failure to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or clearances for our products on a timely basis  or at all  delays in receipt of or failure to receive approvals or clearances  the loss of previously received approvals or clearances  limitations on intended uses imposed as a condition of approvals or clearances  or failure to comply with existing or future regulatory requirements 
in the us  the food and drug administration  or fda  regulates as medical devices most test systems  kits and reagents that are marketed for human in vitro diagnostic use 
pursuant to the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act  the fda regulates the preclinical and clinical testing  design  safety  effectiveness  manufacture  labeling  distribution and promotion of medical devices 
we will not be able to commence marketing or commercial sales in the us of these products until we receive an exemption  clearance or approval from the fda  which can be a lengthy  expensive and uncertain process 
we have not applied for fda or other regulatory approvals with respect to any of our current products or products under development 
we may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development  introduction and marketing of proposed products 
regulatory clearance or approval of any proposed products may not be granted by the fda or foreign regulatory authorities on a timely basis  if at all 
noncompliance with applicable fda requirements can result in criminal prosecution  civil penalties  other administrative sanctions or judicially imposed sanctions  such as injunctions  recall or seizure of products  total or partial suspension of production  and failure of the government to grant premarket clearance or premarket approval for devices or withdrawal of marketing clearances or approvals once granted 
the fda also has the authority to request the recall  repair  replacement or refund of the cost of any regulated device that may eventually be manufactured or distributed by us 
any devices manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to fda clearance or approvals are subject to thorough and continuing regulation by the fda and certain state agencies  including the california department of health services 
our dependence on suppliers for materials could impair our ability to manufacture our products 
outside vendors provide key components and raw materials used by us and hitachi in the manufacture of our products 
although we believe that alternative sources for these components and raw materials are available  any supply interruption in a limited or sole source component or raw material would harm our and hitachi s ability to manufacture our products until a new source of supply is identified and qualified  including qualification under applicable fda regulations 
in addition  an uncorrected defect or supplier s variation in a component or raw material  either unknown to us or hitachi or incompatible with our or hitachi s manufacturing processes  could harm our or hitachi s ability to manufacture products 
we or hitachi may not be able to find a sufficient alternative supplier in a reasonable time period  or on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
if we or hitachi fail to obtain a supplier for the manufacture of components of our potential products  we may be forced to curtail or cease operations 

table of contents if we are unable to manufacture products on a commercial scale  our business may suffer 
hitachi manufactures our nanochip system  and we manufacture our nanochip cartridges  our asrs and most of our other products 
we and hitachi rely on subcontractors to manufacture the limited quantities of microchips and other components we require for use by and sale to our customers  as well as for internal and collaborative purposes 
manufacturing  supply and quality control problems may arise as we or hitachi either alone  together or with subcontractors  attempt to further scale up manufacturing procedures or to manufacture new products 
we or hitachi may not be able to scale up in a timely manner or at a commercially reasonable cost 
problems could lead to delays or pose a threat to the ultimate commercialization of our products and cause us to fail 
we or hitachi or any of our contract manufacturers could encounter manufacturing difficulties  including those relating to the ability to scale up manufacturing capacity  production yields  quality control and assurance  or shortages of components or qualified personnel 
our manufacturing facilities and those of hitachi and any other of our contract manufacturers are or will be subject to periodic regulatory inspections by the fda and other federal  state and international regulatory agencies and these facilities are or may become subject to quality system regulation  or qsr  requirements of the fda 
if we  hitachi or our third party manufacturers  fail to maintain facilities in accordance with qsr regulations  other international quality standards or other regulatory requirements  then the manufacture process could be suspended or terminated which would harm us 
lead times for obtaining materials and components for our products and the manufacturing and introduction of our products may vary significantly which could lead to excess inventory levels as well as shortages of critical components and products if our supply and demand forecasts are inaccurate 
we anticipate that our products  including our asrs and most of our other products will be manufactured and introduced by us and third parties  if any  based on forecasted demand and that we will seek to purchase components and materials in anticipation of the actual receipt of purchase orders from our customers 
lead times for materials and components to be included in our products vary significantly and may depend on factors such as the business practices of each specific supplier and the terms of the particular contracts  as well as the overall market demand for such materials and components at any given time 
also  we often rely on our own and third party forecasted demand for various products and the accuracy of such forecasts may depend on a number of factors  including but not limited to  government reports and recommendations for certain genetic testing  regulatory burdens  competitive products  the nature and effectiveness of our products  the timing and extent of the introduction of our products into the marketplace and other factors 
if the forecasts are inaccurate  we could experience fluctuations in excess inventory of our products  or shortages of critical components or products  either of which could cause our business to suffer 
we currently rely on one manufacturer of our workstation and for certain future generations of the workstation and other hardware products  and only we manufacture our nanochip cartridges  and our asrs and most of our other products  which may delay the manufacture and shipment of our products to customers 
we have signed an exclusive manufacturing agreement with hitachi to manufacture our nanochip workstation and agreements to exclusively manufacture certain of our other second generation workstations and other hardware products to be developed  subject to certain terms and conditions in each agreement 
we have 
table of contents retained exclusive rights pursuant to each agreement to manufacture the nanochip cartridges 
pursuant to the manufacturing agreements and the collaboration agreement  each party is obligated to provide the other with certain notice periods if such party determines to curtail or terminate the manufacturing relationship 
nevertheless  while alternative manufacturers of our workstation and other products currently exist  a lengthy process would be required to negotiate and begin work under a manufacturing agreement with a new manufacturer which could disrupt our manufacturing process and harm our business 
the number of our sales and marketing employees may not result in corresponding numbers of sales or placements of the nanochip system or sale of asrs or other nanogen products 
as of december   we had total employees in our worldwide sales and marketing group 
in july  we incorporated a subsidiary  nanogen europe bv in the netherlands as our european sales office 
as of december   this office employed european based sales executives and support personnel in germany and the netherlands 
developing  training and monitoring this sales and marketing force has required and will further require capital and time expenditures by us and certain of our employees 
the size of our sales and marketing force may not result in corresponding numbers of sales or placements of the nanochip system nor increased product revenues associated with such sales or placements or our asrs or other products 
we may be required to increase or decrease the size of this sales and marketing force as deemed necessary and such increases or decreases in staff will require additional capital and time expenditures by us and our employees 
failure to expand our international sales as we intend would reduce our ability to become profitable 
we expect that a portion of our sales will be made outside the united states 
a successful international effort will require us to develop relationships with international customers and partners 
we may not be able to identify  attract or retain suitable international customers and distribution partners 
as a result  we may be unsuccessful in our international expansion efforts 
furthermore  expansion into international markets will require us to continue to establish and expand foreign sales and marketing efforts  hire additional sales and marketing personnel and maintain good relations with our foreign customers and distribution partners 
international operations involve a number of risks not typically present in domestic operations  including currency fluctuation risks  changes in regulatory requirements  costs and risks of deploying the nanochip system  asrs and other products in foreign countries  licenses  tariffs and other trade barriers  political and economic instability  including the war on terrorism  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign offices  costs and difficulties in establishing and maintaining foreign distribution partnerships  potentially adverse tax consequences  and the burden of complying with a wide variety of complex foreign laws and treaties 
our international sales and marketing efforts will also be subject to the risks associated with the imposition of legislation and regulations relating to the import or export of high technology products 
we cannot predict whether tariffs or restrictions upon the importation or exportation of our products will be implemented by the united states or other countries 

table of contents we may lose money when we exchange foreign currency received from international sales into us dollars 
a portion of our business is expected to be conducted in currencies other than the us dollar 
we recognize foreign currency gains or losses arising from our operations in the period incurred 
as a result  currency fluctuations between the us dollar and the currencies in which we do business will cause foreign currency transaction gains and losses 
we cannot predict the effects of exchange rate fluctuations upon our future operating results because of the number of currencies involved  the variability of currency exposure and the potential volatility of currency exchange rates 
we currently do not engage in foreign exchange hedging transactions to manage our foreign currency exposure 
we may have significant product liability exposure 
we face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability and other claims in the event that our technologies or products are alleged to have caused harm 
these risks are inherent in the testing  manufacturing and marketing of our products 
any product liability claim brought against us could be expensive to defend and could result in a diversion of management s attention from our core business 
a successful product liability claim or series of claims could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we lose our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain additional personnel  we may not be able to pursue collaborations or develop our own products 
we are highly dependent on the principal members of our scientific  manufacturing  marketing  administrative  management and executive personnel  the loss of whose services might significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our objectives 
we face competition from other companies  academic institutions  government entities and other organizations in attracting and retaining personnel 
for the year ended december   the turnover rate at all levels at nanogen was 
for the years ended december  and the turnover rates at nanogen were and  respectively 
turnover at these rates may  and if they continue  will adversely affect us 
the turnover rates above exclude the impact of reductions in workforce 
in april  we reduced our workforce by approximately and incurred a severance charge of approximately  in the second quarter 
also  in october  we reduced our workforce by approximately and incurred severance charges of approximately  during the fourth quarter of fiscal continued layoffs could have an adverse effect on us 
health care reform and restrictions on reimbursement may limit our returns on potential products 
our ability to earn sufficient returns on our products will depend in part on the extent to which reimbursement for our products and related treatments will be available from government health administration authorities  private health coverage insurers  managed care organizations  and other organizations 
if appropriate reimbursement cannot be obtained  we could be prevented from successfully commercializing our potential products 
there are efforts by governmental and third party payors to contain or reduce the costs of health care through various means 
we expect that there will continue to be a number of legislative proposals to implement government controls 
the announcement of proposals or reforms could impair our ability to raise capital 
the adoption of proposals or reforms could impair our business 

table of contents additionally  third party payors are increasingly challenging the price of medical products and services 
if purchasers or users of our products are not able to obtain adequate reimbursement for the cost of using our products  they may forego or reduce their use 
significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved health care products  and whether adequate third party coverage will be available 
if ethical and other concerns surrounding the use of genetic information become widespread  we may have less demand for our products 
genetic testing has raised ethical issues regarding confidentiality and the appropriate uses of the resulting information 
for these reasons  governmental authorities may call for limits on or regulation of the use of genetic testing or prohibit testing for genetic predisposition to certain conditions  particularly for those that have no known cure 
any of these scenarios could reduce the potential markets for our products  which could seriously harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we use hazardous materials in our business 
any claims relating to improper handling  storage or disposal of these materials could be time consuming and costly 
our research and development processes involve the controlled storage  use and disposal of hazardous materials including  but not limited to  biological hazardous materials and radioactive compounds 
we are subject to federal  state and local regulations governing the use  manufacture  storage  handling and disposal of materials and waste products 
although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of these hazardous materials comply with the standards prescribed by law and regulation  the risk of accidental contamination or injury from hazardous materials cannot be completely eliminated 
in the event of an accident  we could be held liable for any damages that result  and any liability could exceed the limits or fall outside the coverage of our insurance 
we may not be able to maintain insurance on acceptable terms  or at all 
we could be required to incur significant costs to comply with current or future environmental laws and regulations 
our stock price could continue to be highly volatile and our stockholders may not be able to resell their shares at or above the price they paid for them 
the market price of our common stock  like that of many other life sciences companies  has been highly volatile and is likely to continue to be highly volatile 
the following factors  among others  could have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock the results of our premarket studies and clinical trials or those of our collaborators or competitors or for dna testing in general  evidence of the safety or efficacy of our potential products or the products of our competitors  the announcement by us or our competitors of technological innovations or new products  the announcement by us of acquisitions by customers of our nanochip system  asrs or our other products  announcements by us of government grants or contracts or of failure to obtain such government grants or contracts  announcements by us of involvement in litigation  developments concerning our patents or other proprietary rights or those of our competitors  including other litigation or patent office proceedings  loss of key board  executive  management or other personnel or the increase or decrease in size of our sales and marketing staff  governmental regulatory actions or the failure to gain necessary clearances or approvals  
table of contents the ability to obtain necessary licenses  changes or announcements in reimbursement policies  developments with our subsidiaries and collaborators  changes in or announcements relating to acquisition programs for our products  including the expiration or continuation of our development site agreements  period to period fluctuations in sales  inventories and our operating results  market conditions for life science stocks  nanotechnology stocks  and other stocks in general  purchases by nanogen pursuant to our stock repurchase program  changes in estimates of our performance by securities analysts and the loss of coverage by one or more securities analysts  the announcement by us of any stock repurchase plan  any purchases made thereunder by us and any cessation of the program by us  changes in the united states war on terrorism and other geopolitical and military situations in which the country is involved  and changes in the price of petroleum  heating oil and any other raw materials that we use at our facilities 
our anti takeover provisions could discourage potential takeover attempts and make attempts by stockholders to change management more difficult 
the approval of two thirds of our voting stock is required to approve some transactions and to take some stockholder actions  including the calling of a special meeting of stockholders and the amendment of any of the anti takeover provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation 
further  pursuant to the terms of our stockholder rights plan adopted in november  as amended  we have distributed a dividend of one right for each outstanding share of common stock 
these rights will cause substantial dilution to the ownership of a person or group that attempts to acquire us on terms not approved in advance by our board of directors and may have the effect of deterring unsolicited takeover attempts 
if we make any acquisitions  we will incur a variety of costs and may never realize the anticipated benefits 
if appropriate opportunities become available  we may attempt to acquire businesses  technologies  services or products that we believe are a strategic fit with our business 
other than the agreement with synx pharma inc discussed below  we currently have no commitments or agreements with respect to any material acquisitions 
if we do undertake any transaction of this sort  the process of integrating an acquired business  technology  service or product may result in operating difficulties and expenditures and may absorb significant management attention that would otherwise be available for ongoing development of our business 
moreover  we may never realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition 
future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurrence of debt  contingent liabilities and or amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets and increased operating expenses  which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
risks related to our definitive agreement with synx failure to complete our proposed transaction with synx pharma inc could cause our stock price to decline and could harm our future business and operations 
our definitive agreement with synx pharma inc contains conditions which we and synx must meet in order to complete the proposed transaction 
in addition  the definitive agreement may be terminated by us or by synx under certain circumstances 

table of contents if the proposed transaction is not completed  we may be subject to the following material risks  among others the price of our common stock may decline to the extent that the current market price of our common stock reflects a market assumption that the proposed transaction will be completed  certain of our costs incurred in connection with the proposed transaction  such as legal  accounting  financial printing and certain expenses of our financial advisor must be paid even if the proposed transaction is not completed  and the secured line of credit of cdn million that we made available to synx prior to entering into the definite agreement might not be repaid 
in addition  we have filed a current report on form k with the sec containing a description of the pro forma financial impact of our proposed transaction with synx 
the synx pro forma financial information disclosed therein is preliminary and is subject to change 
the synx pro forma financial information is for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the operating results or financial position that would have occurred if the proposed transaction had occurred as of the date or during the periods presented 
actual future operating results of the combined entity may differ materially from those described in our pro forma financial presentation of the proposed transaction 
we will incur a variety of costs and may never realize the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions 
if appropriate opportunities become available  we may attempt to acquire businesses  technologies  services or products that we believe are a strategic fit with our business 
in february we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire synx pharma inc  a point of care diagnostic company 
the transaction is valued at approximately cdn million us million and is expected to close in the second quarter of however  the acquisition is subject to the approval of holders of synx common shares and debentures  court approval and other customary closing conditions 
the process of integrating synx or any other acquired business  technology  service or product may result in operating difficulties and expenditures and may absorb significant management attention that would otherwise be available for ongoing development of our business 
moreover  we may never realize the anticipated benefits of the synx acquisition or any other acquisition 
future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurrence of debt  contingent liabilities and or amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets and increased operating expenses  which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition

we believe that our facilities will be suitable and adequate for the present purposes  and that the productive capacity in the san diego and helmond facilities is substantially being utilized 
in the future  we may need to purchase  build or lease additional facilities to meet the requirements projected in our long term business plan 

table of contents the facility in franfurt relates to the operations of nanogen recognomics 
in february  the shareholders of nanogen recognomics decided to convert nanogen recognomics into a non operating holding company to attempt to commercialize its intellectual property through licensing and sales transactions 
as a result  this facility will no longer be necessary 
notice of intent to terminate the lease in accordance with a six month notice period defined in the lease was provided to the nanogen recognomics landlord in item legal proceedings in december  oxford gene technologies ogt filed a complaint against us in the united states district court for the district of delaware claiming that we infringe us patent no

overview it is our goal to become a leading provider of molecular diagnostic tests 
we integrate advanced microelectronics and molecular biology into a core technology platform with potentially broad and diverse commercial applications 
our primary areas of focus have been in genomics and biomedical research  medical diagnostics  forensics and drug discovery 
the company s current commercially available products include the nanochip molecular biology workstation  an automated  multi purpose instrument primarily used for dna based analyses  the nanochip cartridge  which incorporates the nanochip electronic microarray 
table of contents and provides a flexible tool for the rapid identification and precise analysis of biological test samples containing charged molecules  various asrs for gene mutations associated with diseases such as cystic fibrosis and nanogen s general purpose reagents and accessories used to facilitate assay and protocol development and validation on the nanochip system 
the company also has several other asrs and applications of its proprietary technology under development 
the company provides technical support and field applications assistance to its customers 
since commencing operations in  we have applied substantially all of our resources to our research and development programs 
we have incurred losses since inception and  as of december   had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect to continue to incur significant losses over at least the next few years as we attempt to further commercialize our products as well as expand the menu of applications for our current products 
during the year ended december   product related revenue was the largest category of revenue 
while we recognized revenue from product sales during the years ended december   and  our main sources of revenues during these fiscal years were payments under our sponsored research agreements  contracts and grants and  in  a license fee valued at million received from a litigation settlement with combimatrix corp 
we believe that in future periods  our revenue base will continue to be more product driven as certain research collaboration agreements expire and new products are introduced to the marketplace 
we believe our future operating results may be subject to quarterly fluctuations due to a variety of factors  including  but not limited to  market acceptance of the nanochip system and potential products under development  the type of acquisition program our potential customers may choose  whether and when new products are successfully developed and introduced by us or our competitors  and the achievement of milestones under our collaborative agreements with hitachi and various government agencies 
the recognition of revenue under contracts  grants and sponsored research agreements will be subject to significant fluctuations in both timing and amount and therefore our results of operations for any period may not be comparable to the results of operations for any other period 
the terms of our contracts and grants and sponsored research arrangements vary  but can generally be categorized as follows hitachi development program in july  the company executed a ten year agreement with hitachi  ltd  nissei sangyo co 
ltd 
and hitachi instruments service co 
ltd 
of japan collectively  hitachi to develop  manufacture and distribute additional potential products based on the parties proprietary technologies  potentially including  among other things  reduced size instruments for genetic testing  integrated amplification and point of care detection 
the agreement provides that the parties will jointly determine which projects to prioritize over the term of the agreement 
the agreement may be terminated before its expiration by either party  subject to certain restrictions 
pursuant to the terms of the agreement  hitachi and the company each may contribute  toward the research and development efforts of the company  up to million in cash over the ten year period 
at a minimum  the company is required to contribute on an annual basis funding for its own general technology development in an amount equal to or greater than payments made by hitachi 
in addition  the company is liable to repay to hitachi fifty percent of all funding provided by hitachi over an indefinite period of time 
repayment amounts are determined as a percentage of the company s gross nanochip cartridge sales until the liability is paid in full 
furthermore  hitachi made an equity investment in the company by purchasing  shares of the company s common stock worth approximately million pursuant to a private sale by the company based on a per share price of the fair market value as of the signing date of the hitachi agreement 
hitachi has the right to be the exclusive distributor of collaboration products in japan and  based upon the attainment of minimum sales targets to be mutually agreed upon  in other asian countries 
the company retains the exclusive right to distribute collaboration products outside of these countries 
in august  the company received written notice from hitachi to exercise its right to terminate the collaborative research agreement in accordance with the terms of the agreement 
hitachi s exercise of its right to terminate this agreement does not accelerate the repayment due hitachi for the fifty percent of hitachi provided funding 
neither nanogen nor hitachi has terminated any of the other agreements between the companies 
based 
table of contents on joint discussions  nanogen and hitachi have determined to focus their joint efforts on the development and manufacture of a new clinical instrument

the decline in combined revenue associated with sponsored research  
table of contents contract and grants between and is the result of the company s strategic shift away from such sponsored research revenue and more towards product revenue 
the company is shifting from primarily sponsored research funding to product revenues as sales and marketing efforts increase the installed base of our nanochip molecular biology workstation and as programs from research and development collaborations expire 
we offer our products to customers under several different types of acquisition programs  some of which pass title of the instrument to the customer and some of which do not pass title to the customer 
one of these acquisition programs is through development or strategic site agreements  where title does not pass to the customer  however  these agreements may provide for the potential development of content for use on the nanochip system 
as internal and external content development expand the capabilities of the nanochip system  the company believes that consumable sales  including nanochip cartridge sales and eventually asrs and fda cleared or approved kits will account for an increasing portion of our product revenues 
license revenue decreased to million during the year ended from million during the year ended the million license revenue received in consisted entirely of a settlement payment from combimatrix corp 
over a patent matter 
additional minimum license payments are required as part of the settlement agreement  however  these payments are not expected to be significant in fiscal year included a number of highlights

we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition we generate product revenue by the sale of our commercial products and services under various sales programs to the end user or through distribution channels 
we recognize revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin revenue recognition in financial statements and record revenues as follows we offer our nanochip molecular biology workstations under various commercial programs such as direct sale  reagent rental programs and cost per test agreements 
we also offer our workstations to customers under development or strategic site programs that may result in one of the above commercial transactions 
we sell our workstations direct to the end user and to distributors 
revenue from the sale of consumables is recognized upon shipment fob shipping point as we do not sell consumables with a right of return 
revenue from the direct sale of nanochip molecular biology workstations is recognized following receipt of a purchase order  shipment fob shipping point of product  and transfer of title when sold directly to the end user or to a distributor 
in transactions where a right of return exists  revenue is deferred until acceptance has occurred and the period for the right of return has lapsed 
the nanochip molecular biology workstation is sold with a one year warranty contract 
the fair value of the warranty is recorded as deferred revenue and recognized ratably over the warranty period included in the customer contract 
the fair value of the warranty is based on the renewal price paid by the same customer 
this renewal price for the maintenance contract is consistent for all customers 
we provide for the estimated cost of product warranty at the time revenue is recognized 
we also recognize revenue from the sale of our nanochip system under reagent rental and cost per test transactions whereby customers pay a premium for our consumable products nanochip cartridges or asrs over a number of years that is intended to cover the sales price of the nanochip workstation  consumables and warranty 
under a reagent rental transaction  the customer commits to purchasing a fixed number of consumable products on a periodic basis for a specified period of time ie a certain number of cartridges for a certain number 
table of contents of years after a normally brief validation period that varies from to days 
revenue for the workstation  consumables and warranty under reagent rental transactions is recognized as consumable products are shipped  over a period of generally two to five years  depending on the specific customer arrangement as they may vary by customer 
we reclassify the recorded value of the workstation from inventory to fixed assets  recognizing the depreciation expense as cost of sales ratably over the period of the arrangement 
under a cost per reportable transaction  the customer agrees to purchase a certain number of consumable products on a periodic basis determined by the customer s volume of reported test results to third parties from the use of our consumable products

the cost of sales related to the consumables is recorded in line with the revenue ie as consumables are shipped or consumed  depending on the terms of the contract 
we also place our nanochip molecular biology workstations at customer sites under programs  such as development or strategic site arrangements  where title of the nanochip workstation does not transfer to the customer 
no revenues are recognized at the time of placement under these agreements 
these arrangements are generally for marketing purposes and last for a period normally between six and twelve months 
under some of the arrangements  customers may develop content or optimize assays that could result in the creation or enhancement of intellectual property that we may license in the future 
in addition  the customer may decide to purchase the nanochip workstation during the period of the arrangement or at its expiration 
we provide a warranty for these nanochip workstations as well as insure them during the development site period 
warranty expense is recorded ratably over the period of the arrangement and is included within selling  general  and administrative sg a expenses 
development site customers are normally required to purchase any consumables to be used on the instrument from us during the development site period 
we classify this inventory as consignment inventory and include it within finished goods 
we record a reserve for the refurbishment costs  recorded within sg a  for each unit included in consignment inventory in the event the unit is returned under this arrangement 
in addition  we have recorded a reserve related to the older production units that may be deemed obsolete or sold to the customer at a discount due to the age of the unit during the development site period 
transactions under these types of programs do not result in the recognition of revenue  however  if the customer opts to purchase the nanochip workstation at any time  sales revenue is recognized upon receipt of a purchase order 
cost of sales for the workstation is provided for at the time revenue is recognized 
workstations sold to distributors are sold outright with title transferring at point of shipment ie  ie shipping point without a right of return 
workstations are sold at a discount to the standard sales price and without warranty coverage 
sales revenue is subject to fluctuation due to the type of acquisition program our customers may choose 
sponsored research and contract and grant revenue are generally recorded as the costs and expenses to perform the research are incurred 
under certain arrangements revenue is recorded ratably over the term of the arrangement as funding is provided for contractually on a scheduled basis 
payments received in advance under these arrangements are recorded as deferred revenue until the expenses are incurred 
continuation of certain sponsored research and contracts and grants are dependent upon our achieving specific contractual milestones 
license fees include nonrefundable fees generated from the licensing of the company s technology 
revenue is recognized immediately when the company has no further obligation to perform and collections are reasonably assured 
bad debt we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we record additions to our reserve based on specific analysis of each customer s balance due us 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances would be required 

table of contents inventory we reduce the carrying value of our inventory  including nanochip molecular biology workstations placed under development site arrangements  for estimated obsolescence or non marketability after considering future purchase commitments and based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
in september we took an accounting charge of  to reduce product inventory to its estimated net realizable value 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by us  additional inventory write downs may be required 
intangible assets we have intangible assets related to acquired technology rights

sponsored research revenue in consisted of revenue earned in connection with our development program entered into in july with hitachi 
due to the termination of this agreement in with hitachi  we expect sponsored research revenue to be significantly less in versus the final hitachi funding under this agreement is expected in the second quarter of  the amount of which is subject to the achievement of certain milestones 
sponsored research revenue for included million earned in connection with our research and development agreement entered into in january and september with aventis  which included the sale of nanochip molecular biology workstations in each year and million earned in connection with our development program entered into in july with hitachi 
all project milestones established under the research and development agreement entered into in september with aventis were completed as of fiscal year end at which time the agreements expired 
we do not expect to receive additional funding from aventis 

table of contents we fund some of our research and development efforts through contracts and grants awarded by various federal agencies 
revenues are recognized under these contracts and grants as expenses are incurred 
continuation of sponsored research agreements  contracts and grants is dependent upon us achieving specific contractual milestones 
the recognition of revenue under sponsored research agreements and contracts and grants may vary from quarter to quarter and may result in significant fluctuations in operating results from year to year 
cost of sales and gross margins cost of sales totaled million in compared to million and million in and  respectively 
gross margins on product sales revenue were negative in  positive in  and positive and in cost of sales during the years ended december   and were impacted by underabsorbed overhead costs due to underutilized capacity 
the cost per unit of our products remained high  as our volume of production relative to the available capacity remained low 
cost of sales was further impacted by reserves for excess instrument inventory and obsolete raw material components totaling   and  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
gross margins in and were unfavorably impacted due to manufacturing scrap as a result of lower yields on new products released into production 
gross margins during these periods were further impacted by sales of nanochip workstations to certain customers under various discount programs and by sales to distributors  which are generally at a discount 
as we are still in the early stages of commercialization  we expect to continue to incur significant costs associated with excess production capacity within our manufacturing facility in gross margins in future periods may additionally be impaired by minimum product royalties or potential adjustments made to reflect the impairment of intangible assets related to products sold 
research and development expenses research and development expenses totaled million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively

the company is a party to development site agreements with various entities whereby the company may be obligated to pay license fees or royalties for any customer owned or licensed intellectual property used to develop any nanogen commercial products 
none of these agreements individually are considered material 

table of contents we expect that our existing capital resources  combined with million in gross proceeds from the sale of the company s common stock in march  and anticipated revenues from potential product sales  reagent rentals  leases or other types of acquisition programs for the nanochip system  sponsored research agreements  contracts and grants will be sufficient to support our planned operations  including an estimated investment of approximately million related to the pending acquisition of synx and wind down costs related to our joint venture  nanogen recognomics  discussed elsewhere herein  through at least the next eighteen months 
this estimate of the period for which we expect our available sources of liquidity to be sufficient to meet our capital requirements is a forward looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties  and actual results may differ materially 
our future liquidity and capital funding requirements will depend on numerous factors including  but not limited to  commercial success of our products  or lack thereof  the extent to which our products under development are successfully developed and gain market acceptance  the timing of regulatory actions regarding our potential products  the costs and timing of expansion of sales  marketing and manufacturing activities  prosecution and enforcement of patents important to our business and any litigation related thereto  the results of clinical trials  competitive developments  and our ability to maintain existing collaborations and to enter into additional collaborative arrangements 
we have incurred negative cash flow from operations since inception and do not expect to generate positive cash flow to fund our operations for at least the next several years 
we may need to raise additional capital to fund our research and development programs  to scale up manufacturing activities and expand our sales and marketing efforts to support the commercialization of our products under development 
additional capital may not be available on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to curtail our operations significantly or to obtain funds through entering into collaborative agreements or other arrangements on unfavorable terms 
our failure to raise capital on acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
net operating loss carryforwards as of december   we had federal and state net operating loss  or nol  carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively  and million and million of research and development  or r d  tax credits available to offset future federal and state income taxes  respectively 
the federal and state nol carryforwards are subject to alternative minimum tax limitations and to examination by the tax authorities 
the federal tax loss carryforwards will begin expiring in  unless previously utilized  and the state tax loss carryforwards will begin to expire in  unless previously utilized 
the federal and state r d tax credit carryforwards will begin expiring in unless previously utilized 
our initial public offering combined with the concurrent private placement  which occurred in april  may be perceived as a change of ownership under federal income tax regulations 
we also experienced a change of ownership in and as such  we may be limited in the amount of nols incurred prior to our initial public offering  which may be utilized to offset future taxable income 
similar limitations may also apply to utilization of r d tax credits to offset taxes payable 
however  we do not believe such limitations will have a material impact on our ability to utilize the nols
