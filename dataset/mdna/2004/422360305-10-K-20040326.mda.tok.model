item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition general on july   the company completed its acquisition of helix 
helix owned or managed  prior to the combination  hearing healthcare clinics located in massachusetts  new york  ohio  michigan  wisconsin  minnesota  washington and missouri as well as in the provinces of ontario and quebec 
the transaction was effective for financial reporting purposes on june   the first day of the company s third quarter of in connection with the completion of the helix combination  on july  the company changed its name from hearx ltd 
to hearusa  inc 
the company s common stock continues to trade on the american stock exchange under the symbol ear 
the exchangeable shares of hearx canada  inc  the company s canadian subsidiary  trade on the toronto stock exchange under the symbol hux 
on july   the company sold of the shares of the company s three subsidiaries and selected assets associated with the management of the centers located in the canadian province of quebec  previously acquired as part of the helix combination 
the results of the quebec operations have been excluded from results of operations and are classified as discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements 
as a result of the combination with helix and following the divestiture of the quebec subsidiaries  the company now has a network of company owned hearing care centers in the states of florida  new york  new jersey  massachusetts  ohio  michigan  wisconsin  minnesota  missouri  washington and california and the province of ontario  canada 
the company now has a network of approximately  credentialed audiology providers that participate in hearing benefit programs contracted by the company with employer groups  health insurers and benefit sponsors in states 
the company intends  as its long term goal  to establish a nationwide network of centers and network providers 
during  the company completed its integration of the helix centers and capitalized on synergies resulting from the combination with helix to reduce its cost structure and improve its profitability 
in  the company will focus on improving its revenue per transaction and other key performance indicators  such as its conversion  return and binaural rate  while maintaining the same volume of transactions in its centers 
the company will also focus on entering more national managed care contracts in order to increase its network revenues 
critical accounting policies management believes the following critical accounting policies affect the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements goodwill the majority of the company s goodwill resulted from the combination with helix 
on at least an annual basis  the company is required to assess whether its goodwill is impaired 
the company elected to perform this analysis on the first day of its fourth quarter 
in order to do this  management applied judgment in determining its reporting units  which represent distinct parts of the company s business 
the reporting units determined by management are the centers  the network and e commerce 
the definition of the reporting units affects the company s goodwill impairment assessments 
the annual goodwill impairment assessment involves estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and comparing it with its carrying amount 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  additional steps are required to calculate a potential impairment charge 
calculating the fair value of the reporting units requires significant estimates and long term assumptions 
the company utilized an independent appraisal firm to test goodwill for impairment as of the first day of the company s fourth quarter during and  and each of these tests indicated no impairment 
the company estimates the fair value of its reporting units by applying a weighted average of three methods quoted market price  external transactions  and discounted cash flow 
significant changes in key assumptions about the business and its prospects  or changes in market conditions  stock price  interest rates or other externalities  could result in an impairment charge 
revenue recognition hearusa recognizes revenues from the sale of audiological products at the time of delivery and revenues from hearing care services at the time those services are performed 
the company has capitation contracts with certain healthcare organizations under which the company is paid an amount for each enrollee of the health maintenance organization to provide to the enrollee a once every three years discount on certain hearing products and services 
the amount paid to the company by the healthcare organization is calculated on a per capita basis and is referred to as capitation revenue 
the company defers recognition of capitation revenue until the earlier of the actual utilization by the member populations of the benefit  or the end of the contract term 
when the actual utilization of the benefit by the member population exceeds the amount received on a per capita basis over utilization  the excess is recorded as accounts receivable on the balance sheet 
usually  the hearing benefit is structured in a way that the member can use it only once every three years 
in these circumstances  historical data shows that the benefit will generally be over utilized the first year  appropriately utilized the second year and under utilized the third year 
the company estimates an allowance to reduce the accounts receivable from over utilization to a level equivalent to the estimated future under utilization during the remaining term of the benefit 
allowance for doubtful accounts certain of the accounts receivable of the company are from health insurance and managed care organizations and government agencies 
these organizations could take up to nine months before paying a claim made by the company and also impose a limit on the time the claim can be billed 
the company provides an allowance for doubtful accounts equal to the estimated uncollectible amounts 
that estimate is based on historical collection experience  current economic and market conditions  and a review of the current status of each customer s trade accounts receivable 
in order to calculate that allowance  the company first identifies any known uncollectible amounts in its accounts receivable listing and charges them against the existing allowance for doubtful accounts 
then a specific percent per plan and per ageing categories is applied against the remaining receivables to estimate the new allowance 
any changes in the percent assumptions per plan and ageing categories could result in a change in the allowance for doubtful accounts 
for example  an increase of in the percent used would increase the allowance for doubtful accounts by approximately  sales returns the company provides to all patients purchasing hearing aids a specific return period of at least days if the patient is dissatisfied with the product 
the company provides an allowance in accrued expenses for returns 
the return period can be extended to days if the patient attends the company s help program 
the company calculates its allowance for returns using estimates based upon actual historical returns 
the cost of the hearing aid is reimbursed to the company by the manufacturer if the return is made within days from the time of delivery to the hearing center

the total of such payments in is estimated to be approximately million  of which approximately million is included as a current maturity of tranche d and approximately  as a current maturity of tranche e  based on approval by siemens of the application of the payments 
the siemens credit facility imposes certain financial and other covenants on the company  which are customary for loans of this size and nature  including restrictions on the conduct of the company s business  the occurrence of indebtedness  merger or sale of assets  the modification of material agreements  changes in capital structure  making certain payments and paying dividends 
if the company cannot maintain compliance with these covenants  siemens may terminate future funding under the credit facility and declare all then outstanding amounts under the facility immediately due and payable

in the event of a shortfall in cash  the company might consider short term debt  or additional equity or debt offerings 
there can be no assurance however  that such financing will be available to the company on favorable terms or at all
