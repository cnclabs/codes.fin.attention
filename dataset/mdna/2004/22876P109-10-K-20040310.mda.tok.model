critical accounting policies and estimates the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect the significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements investments in real estate 
rental property and improvements  including interest and other costs capitalized during construction  are included in real estate investments and are stated at cost 
expenditures for ordinary maintenance and repairs are expensed to operations as they are incurred 
significant renovations and improvements  which improve or extend the useful life of the assets  are capitalized 
except for amounts attributed to land  rental property and improvements are depreciated as described below 
the company recognizes gains on the sale of property in accordance with sfas no 
revenues from sales of property are recognized when a significant down payment is received  the earnings process is complete and the collection of any remaining receivables is reasonably assured 
depreciation and amortization 
the company computes depreciation on its operating properties using the straight line method based on estimated useful lives of three to years 
a significant portion of the acquisition cost of each operating property is allocated to the acquired buildings usually to 
the allocation of the acquisition cost to buildings and the determination of the useful lives are based on the company s estimates 
if the company were to allocate acquisition costs inappropriately to buildings or to incorrectly estimate the useful lives of its operating properties  it may be required to adjust future depreciation expense 
deferred tenant costs leasing commissions and tenant relocation costs are amortized over the term of the related leases 
impairment of long lived assets 
the company s long lived assets include investments in real estate 
the company assesses impairment of long lived assets whenever changes or events indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the company assesses impairment of operating properties based on the operating cash 
table of contents flows of the properties 
in performing its assessment  the company must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
during the year ended december   no impairment charges were recorded 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record impairment charges 
revenue recognition 
rental income is generally recognized over the lives of leases according to provisions of the underlying lease agreements 
certain leases provide for tenant occupancy during periods for which no rent is due or where minimum rent payments increase during the term of the lease 
for these leases  the company records rental income for the full term of each lease on a straight line basis 
for  and  the recognition of rental revenues on a straight line basis for applicable leases increased rental revenues by   and  respectively  over the amount which would have been recognized based upon the contractual provisions of these leases 
the company historically generated management fees and leasing commissions income by providing on site property management and leasing services to a limited number of third party owners 
management fees are generally earned monthly and are a based on a percentage of the managed properties monthly rental and other operating revenues 
leasing commissions are earned when the company  on behalf of the third party owner  negotiates or assists in the negotiation of new leases  renewals and expansions of existing leases  and are generally a percentage of rents to be received under the initial term of the respective leases 
the management and leasing agreements between the company and third party owners generally are based on annually renewable terms and may be terminated in certain cases and for certain reasons by either party with a to day depending on the terms of the specific agreement notice 
allowances for doubtful accounts 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its tenants to make required payments for rents and other rental services 
in assessing the recoverability of these receivables  the company makes assumptions regarding the financial condition of the tenants based primarily on past payment trends and certain financial information that tenants submit to the company 
if the financial condition of the company s tenants were to deteriorate and result in an impairment of their ability to make payments  the company may be required to increase its allowances by recording additional bad debt expense 
likewise  should the financial condition of its tenants improve and result in payments or settlements of previously reserved amounts  the company may be required to record a reduction in bad debt expense 
federal income taxes 
the company is qualified and has elected tax treatment as a real estate investment trust under the internal revenue code a reit

based on a market interest rate of percent  the fair value of the company s mortgages and loans payable would be approximately million at december  fair value of in place leases 
the company adopted sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  which discontinues the practice of amortizing goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets and initiates an annual review for impairment 
impairment would be examined more frequently if certain indicators were encountered 
intangible assets with a determinable useful life will continue to be amortized over that period 
the amortization provisions apply to goodwill and intangible assets acquired after september  sfas no 
also requires the separate recognition of intangible assets acquired as part of an asset acquisition  including the value attributable to leases in place and certain customer relationships 
the company recorded    and  of the estimated value of leases in place as part of its acquisitions of three ravinia  the lakes on post oak  tollway crossing  and cigna plaza  respectively

the company is currently evaluating any other intangible asset that may have arisen in its acquisition of the mcginnis park property  which is not expected to have a material impact on the company s results from operations 
cash and cash equivalents 
cash in excess of daily requirements is invested in short term monetary securities 
such temporary cash investments have an original maturity of less than three months and are deemed to be cash equivalents for purposes of the consolidated financial statements 
restricted cash 
restricted cash represents amounts contractually and internally placed in escrow for purposes of making payments for certain future building improvements  tenant allowances  leasing commissions  real estate taxes  and debt service 
estimates 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
these estimates are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
however  actual results could differ from the company s estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates the reasonableness of its estimates

management periodically reviews its investment in properties for evidence of impairments in value 
factors considered consist of  but are not limited to current and projected occupancy rates  market conditions in different geographic regions  and management s plans with respect to its properties 
if management were to conclude that expected cash flows would not enable the company to recover the carrying amount of its investments  losses would be recorded and asset values would be reduced 
no such impairments in value were recognized during  or liquidity and capital resources operating activities 
during the year ended december   the company generated approximately million in net cash from operating activities  approximately  less than the company s decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to lower average occupancy rates in as compared to  along with higher free rent concessions provided to new tenants in these decreases were substantially offset by an increase in operating income related to the company s acquisitions

as a reit for federal income tax purposes  the company is required to pay out annually  as dividends  at least percent of its reit taxable income which  due to non cash charges  including depreciation and net operating loss carryforwards  may be substantially less than cash flow 
in the past  the company has paid out dividends in amounts at least equal to its reit taxable income 
the company believes that its cash provided by operating activities and its current cash balance will be sufficient to cover debt service payments and to pay the dividends required to maintain its reit status 
the level of cash flow generated by rents depends primarily on the occupancy rates of the company s buildings and changes in rental rates on new and renewed leases and under escalation provisions contained in most leases 
as of december   approximately percent of the company s annualized gross rental revenues were derived from existing leases containing provisions for rent escalations 
however  market conditions may prevent the company from escalating rents under such provisions

leases were renewed on approximately percent  percent  and percent of the company s rentable square feet  which expired during  and  respectively 
for those leases which renewed during  the average base rental rate decreased from to  a decrease of percent 
current market conditions in certain markets may require that rental rates at which leases are renewed or at which vacated space is leased be lower than rental rates under existing leases 
based upon the amount of leases which will expire during and the competition for tenants in the markets in which the company operates  the company has offered  and expects to continue to offer  incentives to certain new and renewal tenants 
these incentives may include the payment of tenant improvement costs and  in certain markets  reduced rents during initial lease periods 
the company has historically benefited from generally positive economic conditions and stable occupancy levels in many of the metropolitan areas in which the company owns office buildings 
the company believes that the southeastern united states and texas provides significant economic growth potential due to the areas diverse regional economies  expanding metropolitan areas  skilled work force and moderate labor costs 
however  over the past several years due to general economic trends  the company is currently experiencing a decrease in the demand for office space in the markets in which it owns office buildings 
cash flow from operations could be reduced if a weakened economy resulted in lower occupancy  declining market rental rates  and lower rental income for the company s office buildings  which may in turn affect the amount of dividends paid by the company 
for the properties owned on december   occupancy was percent 
governmental tenants including the state of florida and the united states of america  which accounted for percent of the company s leased space as of december   may be subject to budget reductions in times of recession and governmental austerity measures

furthermore  prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing  such as the reluctance of lenders to make commercial real estate loans  may result in higher interest rates upon refinancing than the interest rates on the existing debt 
consequently  the interest expense relating to the refinanced debt would increase and 
table of contents adversely affect its cash flow and the amount of distributions the company could make to its shareholders 
where the company mortgages a property to secure payment of debt  if the company is unable to meet the mortgage payments  then the mortgagee may foreclose upon  or otherwise take control of  the mortgaged property  with a consequent loss of income and asset value to the company 
risk of rising interest rates and variable rate debt 
increases in interest rates on the company s variable rate debt could increase the company s interest expense  which would adversely affect its cash flow and ability to pay dividends to shareholders 
at december   the company had an outstanding balance of million on its million secured revolving credit facility  million in term loans with variable interest rates and the company may incur additional variable rate debt in the future 
increases in interest rates on this variable rate debt could increase the company s interest expense and adversely affect cash flow and the ability to pay dividends to shareholders 
the company may be required to purchase interest rate protection products in connection with future variable rate debt  which may further increase borrowing costs 
existing leverage  no limitation on debt 
the company s board of directors can increase the company s total debt ratio without shareholder approval and any such increase could adversely affect cash flow and cash available for distribution to shareholders 
as of december   the ratio of the company s total consolidated debt to the sum of the market value of issued and outstanding capital stock plus total consolidated debt was approximately 
the company s policy regarding this debt to total market capitalization ratio is not subject to any limitation in its organizational documents 
accordingly  the company s board of directors could establish policies which would allow the company to increase its debt to total market capitalization ratio  subject to any existing debt covenants 
if this action were taken  the company could become more highly leveraged  resulting in increased debt service costs that a could adversely affect cash flow and  consequently  the amount of cash available for distribution to its shareholders and b could increase the risk of default on the company s debt 
for purposes of establishing and evaluating the company s debt policy  the company measures its leverage by reference to total market capitalization rather than by reference to the book value of its assets  which are mainly comprised of the depreciated value of real property  the company s primary tangible asset 
the company uses total market capitalization because it believes the book value of its assets does not accurately reflect its ability to borrow and meet debt service requirements 
the company s market capitalization is more variable than book value  however  and does not necessarily reflect the fair market value of its assets at all times 
the company considers factors other than market capitalization in making decisions regarding the incurrence of indebtedness  however  such as the purchase price of properties to be acquired with debt financing  the estimated market value of properties upon refinancing and its ability to generate cash flow to cover expected debt service expenses 
geographic concentration since the company s properties are concentrated in the southeastern united states and texas  the company s performance and ability to pay dividends to shareholders is dependent on economic conditions in the markets where its properties are located 
the company s revenues and the value of its properties may be affected by a number of factors  including a the regional and local economic climates of the metropolitan areas in which the properties are located  which may be adversely impacted by business layoffs or downsizing  industry slowdowns  changing demographics and other factors  and b the regional and local real estate conditions in these areas  including oversupply of  or reduced demand for  office and other competing commercial properties 
all of the company s office projects are located in the southeastern united states and texas 
there is also the risk of over building in certain sub markets located in markets which the company currently serves 
while the company has generally avoided acquiring or developing property in over built sub markets  over built conditions may occur in sub markets where the company currently own properties 
the company s performance and ability to pay dividends to shareholders is dependent on economic conditions in the markets where its properties are located 
the company s historical growth has occurred during periods when the economy in the southeastern united states has out performed the national economy 
there can be no assurance as to the continued growth of the economy in the southeastern united states and texas or the company s future growth rate 

table of contents renewal of leases and reletting of space if the company is unable to promptly relet or renew leases as they expire  the company s cash flow and ability to pay expected dividends to shareholders may be adversely affected 
the company is subject to the risks that upon expiration of leases for space located in its buildings a such leases may not be renewed  b such space may not be relet or c the terms of renewal or reletting  taking into account the cost of required renovations  may be less favorable than the current lease terms 
leases on a total of and of the total rentable square feet leased in the company s buildings will expire in and  respectively 
if the company is unable to promptly relet  or renew the leases for  a substantial portion of the space located in its buildings  or if the rental rates upon such renewal or reletting are significantly lower than expected rental rates  or if the company s reserves for these purposes prove inadequate  the company s cash flow and ability to pay expected dividends to shareholders may be adversely affected 
if the company s tenants declare bankruptcy or are unable to make rental payments  the company s cash flow and ability to pay dividends to shareholders will be adversely affected 
at any time  a tenant of the company s building s may seek the protection of the bankruptcy laws  which could result in the rejection and termination of such tenant s lease and thereby cause a reduction in the company s cash flow and ability to pay dividends to shareholders 
no assurance can be given that tenants will not file for bankruptcy protection in the future or  if any tenants file  that they will affirm their leases and continue to make rental payments in a timely manner 
in addition  tenants from time to time may experience a downturn in their business which may weaken their financial condition and result in their failure to make rental payments when due 
if a tenant s lease is not affirmed following bankruptcy or if a tenant s financial condition weakens  the company s income may be adversely affected 
leases with state of florida the company has a significant number of leases with the state of florida 
if these leases are terminated early or not renewed  the company s performance and ability to pay dividends to shareholders could be adversely impacted 
at december   the company had leases with various departments and agencies of the state of florida which totaled approximately  rentable square feet  which represents approximately of the company s total rentable square feet 
the majority of these leases are for space in the company s office projects located in tallahassee  florida 
these leases have provisions for early termination for various reasons  including lack of budget appropriations 
during times of recession and government shortage measures  the state of florida may be subject to budget reductions and may decide to terminate certain of its leases prior to the contractual lease expiration date 
in addition  these leases provide the state of florida with the right to terminate  without penalty  prior to the contractual lease expiration date in the event a state owned building becomes available for occupancy upon giving six months advance written notice to the company 
during  the state of florida announced its intention to eliminate its department of labor  which had a direct impact on the company s property in tallahassee 
the company is currently evaluating the long term impact of this reorganization and is in negotiations with other state departments to reassign the vacated space 
real estate investment risks general risks 
if the company s properties do not generate revenues sufficient to meet operating expenses  the company s cash flow and ability to pay dividends to shareholders will be adversely affected 
real property investments are subject to varying degrees of risk 
the yields available from equity investments in real estate depend in large part on the amount of income generated and expenses incurred 
if the company s properties do not generate revenues sufficient to meet operating expenses  including current levels of debt service  tenant improvements  leasing commissions and other capital expenditures  the company may have to borrow additional amounts to cover fixed costs and the company s cash flow and ability to pay dividends to shareholders will be adversely affected 
the company s net revenues and the value of its properties may be adversely affected by a number of factors  including national  regional and local economic climates  regional and local real estate conditions  the perceptions of prospective tenants as to the attractiveness of the company s properties  the company s ability to provide adequate management  maintenance and insurance  and increased operating costs  including real estate taxes and utilities 

table of contents in addition  real estate values and income from properties are affected by applicable laws  including tax laws  interest rate levels and the availability of financing 
illiquidity of real estate 
since real estate investments are generally illiquid  the company s ability to adapt to changing economic and other conditions will be limited 
equity real estate investments are relatively illiquid 
such illiquidity will limit the company s ability to vary its portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions 
in the event of a downturn in the economy  the company may suffer a material adverse impact to the value of its investments 
competition 
the company faces intense competition that affects its ability to lease properties and the company s failure to attract and retain tenants could adversely impact its cash flow and ability to pay dividends to shareholders 
numerous office buildings compete with the company s properties in attracting tenants to lease space 
some of these competing buildings are newer  have better locations or have better capitalizations 
the company believes that major national or regional commercial property developers will continue to seek development opportunities in the southeastern and southwestern united states 
these developers may have greater financial resources than the company does 
the number of competitive commercial properties in a particular area could have a material adverse effect on the company s ability to lease space in its office projects or at newly developed or acquired properties or on the amount of rents charged 
in order to secure tenants or remain competitive  the company may have to increase its marketing and administrative efforts and related expenses in connection with filling vacant space  reduce the rent the company requires tenants to pay  and make modifications to its properties 
such efforts  as well as the company s failure to attract and retain tenants  could adversely impact the company s cash flow and ability to pay dividends to shareholders 
changes in laws 
the company faces numerous and changing regulations that result in significant unanticipated expenditures that could have an adverse effect on its cash flow and ability to pay dividends 
the company s properties are subject to various federal  state and local regulatory requirements  such as requirements of the americans with disabilities act the ada and state and local fire and life safety requirements 
failure to comply with these requirements could result in the imposition of fines by governmental authorities or awards of damages to private litigants 
the company believes that its properties are currently in substantial compliance with all these regulatory requirements 
however  there can be no assurance that these requirements will not be changed or that new requirements will not be imposed which would require significant unanticipated expenditures that could have an adverse effect on the company s cash flow and ability to pay dividends 
under the ada  all public accommodations and commercial facilities are required to meet certain federal requirements relating to access and use by disabled persons 
these requirements became effective in compliance with the requirements of the ada could require removal of access barriers and non compliance could result in the imposition of fines by the us government or an award of damages to private litigants 
although the company believes its properties are substantially in compliance with these requirements  the company may incur additional costs to comply with the ada 
although the company believes that such costs will not have a material adverse effect  if required changes involve a greater expenditure than the company currently anticipate  its ability to pay dividends to shareholders could be adversely affected 
possible environmental liabilities 
under various federal  state and local environmental laws  ordinances and regulations  a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be required to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at such property and may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage and for investigation and clean up costs incurred by such parties in connection with the contamination 
these laws typically impose clean up responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner knew  or caused the presence  of the contaminants  and the liability under these laws has been interpreted to be joint and several unless the harm is divisible and there is a reasonable basis for allocation of responsibility 
the costs of investigation  remediation or removal of environmental contaminants may be substantial  and the presence of these substances  or the failure to properly remediate the contamination on the property  may adversely affect the owner s ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral 
any person who arranges for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances at a disposal or treatment facility also may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of a 
table of contents release of hazardous or toxic substances at the disposal or treatment facility  whether or not the facility is owned or operated by the person 
in addition  some environmental laws create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and costs that it incurs in connection with the contamination 
finally  the owner of a site may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from a site 
certain federal  state and local laws  regulations and ordinances govern the removal  encapsulation or disturbance of asbestos containing materials when such materials are in poor condition or in the event of construction  remodeling  renovation or demolition of a building 
such laws may impose liability for release of asbestos containing materials and may provide for third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury associated with these materials 
in connection with the company s ownership and operation of properties  the company may be potentially liable for costs associated with asbestos containing materials 
the company s environmental assessments of its properties have not revealed any environmental liability that the company believes would have a material adverse effect on its business  assets or results of operations taken as a whole  nor is the company aware of any such material environmental liability 
nevertheless  it is possible that the company s assessments did not reveal all environmental liabilities or that there are material environmental liabilities of which the company is unaware 
moreover  there can be no assurance that future laws  ordinances or regulations will not impose any material environmental liability or that the current environmental condition of the company s properties will not be affected by tenants  by the condition of land or operations in the vicinity of the company s properties  such as the presence of underground storage tanks  or by third parties unrelated to the company 
if the company suffers an uninsured loss or a loss exceeding its policy limits  the company could lose both the capital invested in  and anticipated profits from  one or more of its properties 
the company currently carries comprehensive liability  fire  and flood where appropriate  extended coverage and rental loss insurance with respect to its properties  with policy specifications and insured limits customary for similar properties 
there are  however  certain types of losses  such as from earthquakes  wars or certain acts of terrorism  including nuclear  chemical  and biological attacks  that may be either uninsurable or not economically insurable 
should an uninsured loss or a loss exceeding policy limits occur  the company could lose both the capital invested in  and anticipated profits from  one or more of its properties 
risks involved in property ownership through partnership and joint ventures 
since the company owns certain properties through partnership and joint venture arrangements  the company may not maintain sufficient control of its investment to permit its business objectives to be achieved 
although the company has generally owned of the interests in all its properties  on december   the company entered into a joint venture arrangement to acquire a interest in two class a mid rise office buildings and undeveloped land suitable for development in the mcginnis park office complex in alpharetta  georgia 
furthermore  in january  the company entered into a joint venture arrangement to acquire a interest in the broward financial centre in fort lauderdale  florida 
in the future  the company could  if then permitted by the covenants in its loan agreements and its financial position  participate with other entities in property ownership through partnerships or joint ventures 
partnership or joint venture investments may  under certain circumstances  involve risks not otherwise present in property ownership  including the possibility that a the company s partners or co ventures might become bankrupt  b such partners or co ventures might at any time have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with the company s business interests or goals  and c such partners or co ventures may be in a position to take action contrary to the company s instructions or requests or contrary to the company s policies or objectives  including the company s policy to maintain its qualification as a reit 
there is no limitation under the company s organizational documents as to the amount of available funds that may be invested in partnerships or joint ventures 
impact of inflation 
the company may experience increases in its expenses  including debt service  as well as decreased occupancy rates as a result of inflation 
the company may experience increases in its expenses  including debt service  as a result of inflation 
the company s exposure to inflationary cost increases in property 
table of contents level expenses is reduced by escalation clauses  which are included in most of its leases 
however  market conditions may prevent the company from escalating rents 
inflationary pressure may increase operating expenses  including labor and energy costs and  indirectly  real estate taxes  above expected levels at a time when it may not be possible for the company to increase lease rates to offset these higher operating expenses 
in addition  inflation can have secondary effects upon occupancy rates by decreasing the demand for office space in many of the markets in which the company operates 
effect of market interest rates on price of common and preferred stock an increase in market interest rates could reduce cash available for distribution to shareholders and adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock 
one of the factors that will influence the market price of the company s common stock in public markets is the annual dividend yield on the share price reflected by dividends paid by the company as compared to the yields on other financial instruments 
an increase in market interest rates may lead prospective investors to demand a higher annual yield which could reduce the market price of the company s common stock 
an increase in market interest rates also could increase the company s debt service expense and thus  reduce cash available for distribution to shareholders 
risk of development  construction and acquisition activities the company faces numerous development  construction and acquisition risks that could have an adverse effect on its cash flow and ability to pay dividends 
within the constraints of the company s policy concerning leverage  the company has and will continue to develop and construct office buildings  particularly on its undeveloped land 
risks associated with the company s development and construction activities  including activities relating to its undeveloped land  may include abandonment of development opportunities  construction costs of a property exceeding original estimates and possibly making the completion of a property uneconomical  occupancy rates and rents at a newly completed property insufficient to make the property profitable  unavailability of financing on favorable terms for development of a property  and the failure to complete construction and lease up on schedule  resulting in increased debt service expense and construction costs 
in addition  new development activities  regardless of whether or not they are ultimately successful  typically require a substantial portion of management s time and attention 
development activities are subject to risks relating to the inability to obtain  or delays in obtaining  all necessary zoning  land use  building  occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations 
the company will continue to acquire office buildings 
acquisitions of office buildings entail risks that investments will fail to perform in accordance with expectations 
estimates of the cost of improvements to bring an acquired building up to standards established for the market position intended for such building may prove inaccurate 
in addition  there are general investment risks associated with any new real estate investment 
the company anticipates that any future developments and acquisitions would be financed through a combination of internally generated cash  equity investments and secured or unsecured financing 
if new developments are financed through construction loans  there is a risk that  upon completion of construction  permanent financing for newly developed properties may not be available or may be available only on disadvantageous terms 
changes in policies without shareholder approval the company can change its investment  financing  borrowing  distribution  and other policies without shareholder approval  in a manner that could adversely affect its financial condition or results of operations or the market price of its common stock 
the company s investment  financing  borrowing and distribution policies  as well as its policies with respect to all other activities  including growth  capitalization and operations  are determined by the company s board of directors 
although the board of directors has no present intention to do 
table of contents so  these policies may be amended or revised at any time and from time to time at the discretion of the board of directors without a vote of the company s shareholders 
a change in these policies could adversely affect the company s financial condition or results of operations or the market price of its common stock 
adverse consequences of failure to qualify as a reit the company s failure to qualify as a reit may have a material adverse impact on an investment in the company s capital stock 
the company believes that it qualifies as a reit under the internal revenue code  which affords the company significant tax advantage 
the requirements for this qualification  however  are complex 
if the company fails to meet these requirements  its dividends will not be deductible by the company and the company will be subject to a corporate level tax on its taxable income 
this would substantially reduce the company s cash available to pay dividends and investors yield on their investment 
in addition  incurring corporate income tax liability might cause the company to borrow funds  liquidate some of its investments or take other steps that could negatively affect its operating results 
moreover  if the company s reit status is terminated because of its failure to meet a reit qualification requirement or if the company voluntarily revokes its election  the company would be disqualified from electing treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year in which reit status is lost 
certain requirements for reit qualification may in the future limit the company s ability to increase fee development  management and leasing operations conducted  and related services offered  by its subsidiaries without jeopardizing its qualification as a reit 
adverse consequences on the company s stock to changes in tax law the jobs and growth tax relief reconciliation act of  which was enacted into law on may   among other things  generally reduces to the maximum marginal rate of tax payable by domestic non corporate taxpayers on dividends received from a regular c corporation 
this reduced tax rate  however  will not apply to dividends paid to domestic non corporate taxpayers by a reit on its stock  except for certain limited amounts 
although the earnings of a reit that are distributed to its stockholders still generally will be subject to less federal income taxation than earnings of a non reit c corporation that are distributed to its stockholders net of corporate level income tax  this legislation could cause domestic non corporate investors to view the stock of regular c corporations as more attractive relative to the stock of a reit than was the case prior to the enactment of the legislation  because the dividends from regular c corporations will generally be taxed at a lower rate while dividends from reits will generally be taxed at the same rate as the individual s other ordinary income 
the company cannot predict what effect  if any  the enactment of this legislation may have on the value of the stock of reits in general or on its common or preferred stock in particular  either in terms of price or relative to other investments

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the company currently has a million secured revolving credit facility and term loans with variable interest rates 
the company may incur additional variable rate debt in the future to meet its financing needs 
increases in interest rates on such debt could increase the company s interest expense  which would adversely affect the company s cash flow and its ability to pay dividends to its shareholders 
the company has not entered into any interest rate hedge contracts in order to mitigate the interest rate risk with respect to the secured revolving credit facility 
as of december   the company had million outstanding under loans with variable interest rates 
if the weighted average interest rate on this variable rate debt were basis points higher or lower  annual interest expense would be increased or decreased by approximately  additionally  the company had million outstanding under loans with fixed interest rates as of december  the company may incur additional fixed rate debt in the future to meet its financing needs 
should market interest rates decline  the company s use of fixed rate debt financing may result in the recognition of interest expense at rates higher than market rates 
if the market interest rate on this fixed rate debt were basis points lower  the company would forfeit annual interest expense savings of approximately  as compared to variable rate debt financing
