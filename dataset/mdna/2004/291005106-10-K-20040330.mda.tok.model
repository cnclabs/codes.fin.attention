item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview emeritus is a washington corporation organized by daniel r 
baty and two other founders in in november  we completed our initial public offering 
from through  we expanded rapidly through acquisition and internal development and by december   operated assisted living communities with  units 
we believe  however  that during this expansion  the assisted living industry became significantly over built  creating an environment characterized by sluggish or falling occupancy and market resistance to rate increases 
as a result of these difficult operating circumstances  we limited further growth and in began an increasing focus first on raising our occupancy and later on operating efficiencies and cost controls as well as implementing a systematic rate enhancement program 
we believe that the health of the assisted living industry is improving and that there are developing opportunities to improve occupancy and adjust rates  as well as greater access to capital 
in light of these perceptions  we have completed several acquisitions in the last two years and have  and are continuing  to convert managed communities to owned or lease communities where opportunities are available 
in and  we continued to operate approximately communities  but in and  we increased that to and communities  respectively  primarily through the lease of communities formerly operated by marriott and through other selected acquisitions 
from the end of to the end of  the communities we manage decreased from to and the owned and leased communities increased from to  reflecting both our increasing confidence in the assisted living industry and the availability of capital 
in we expect to continue reviewing acquisition opportunities and seeking to take ownership or lease positions in communities that we manage 
to this end  we have announced a proposed lease acquisition of up to communities that we formerly managed  a second lease acquisition of nine memory loss facilities  and two other communities

   percentage increase decrease included in our consolidated portfolio of communities 
the leased communities are all operating leases  in which the revenues and expenses from these communities are included in the consolidated statement of operations  but the assets and liabilities are not included in the consolidated balance sheets 
buildings managed decreased in due to termination of regent management contracts  the emeritrust ii communities  which were leased as of september   and the horizon bay communities  which were leased as of december  one managed building has been shut down and was sold march  in   and  we managed   and of these communities  respectively 
two of the important factors affecting our financial results are the rates we charge our residents and the occupancy levels we achieve in our communities 
we rely primarily on our residents ability to pay our charges for services from their own or familial resources and expect that we will do so for the foreseeable future 
although care in an assisted living community is typically less management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued expensive than in a skilled nursing facility  we believe that generally only seniors with income or assets meeting or exceeding the regional median can afford to reside in our communities 
in this context  we must be sensitive to our residents financial circumstances and remain aware that rates and occupancy are interrelated 
in evaluating the rate component  we generally rely on the average monthly revenue per unit  computed by dividing the total revenue for a particular period by the average number of occupied units determined on a monthly basis for the same period 
in evaluating the occupancy component  we generally rely on the an average occupancy rate  computed by dividing the average units available  determined on a monthly basis  during a particular period by the average number of units occupied  determined on a monthly basis  during the period 
in october  we acquired buildings through lease with approximately  units and in march  we acquired eight buildings through lease with approximately units 
at the time of acquisition  these groups of communities had different rate and occupancy characteristics and  therefore  have a distorting effect on the rate and occupancy comparisons between and as a consequence  the comparison including and excluding these communities is presented below 
we evaluate these and other operating components for our consolidated portfolio  which included the communities we own and lease  and our operating portfolio  which also includes the communities we manage as if we were the owner or lessor 
in our consolidated portfolio  our average monthly revenue per unit increased from  in to  in and to  in these changes represented increases of and for each of the two years 
excluding the acquisition communities referred to above  the corresponding changes were for and for we believe that these improvements were a consequence of a carefully designed rate enhancement program that we began implementing in in our consolidated portfolio  our average occupancy rate was in  decreasing to in and further decreasing to in excluding the acquisition communities referred to above  our average occupancy rate was in compared to in we believe that these occupancy rates reflect industry wide factors  such as the supply of available units  which have tended to keep pressure on occupancy levels  as well as  our own actions and policies 
at the time the acquisition communities were added to our consolidated portfolio  their occupancy rates were lower average rate for was and their average revenue per occupied unit was higher  for than the balance of our portfolio 
we also believe that our rate enhancement program has affected occupancy growth and we continue to evaluate the factors of rate and occupancy to find the optimum balance 
since our inception in  we have incurred operating losses and as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we believe that these losses have resulted from our early emphasis on expansion  financing costs arising from multiple financing and refinancing transactions related to this expansion  administrative and corporate expenses that we incurred in anticipation of further expansion that did not materialize and occupancy rates that have declined and remained lower for longer periods than we anticipated 
significant transactions in we substantially increased the number of communities we lease  reduced the number of communities we manage  repurchased all of our outstanding series a preferred stock and  in connection with these changes  increased and restructured portions of our long term financing obligations 
the transactions associated with these developments are summarized below 
emeritrust transactions since  we have managed communities under arrangements with several related investor groups that involved i payment of management fees to us  ii options for us to purchase the communities at a price determined by a formula  and iii obligations to fund operating losses of certain communities 
emeritrust i communities management 
during  and  we managed the emeritrust i communities  which included of the communities  under a management agreement providing for a base fee of of gross revenues generated by the communities and an additional management fee of of gross revenues  payable to the extent of of cash flow from the communities 
the management agreement also required us to fund cash operating losses of the communities 
in each of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued april and august  the emeritrust i owners disposed of a community  reducing the number of managed communities to under this arrangement  we received management fees net of our funding obligations of approximately million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
this management agreement  as extended several times  expired at the end of on january   we and the emeritrust i investors entered into a new management agreement providing for management fees computed on the same basis and i terminating all options to purchase the communities  ii terminating any further funding obligation  and iii providing for a term expiring september   provided that either party may terminate the agreement on days notice 
in march  this management agreement was amended to provide for a management fee of of gross revenues 
in  we do not expect to receive management fees for the emeritrust i communities at the same level as we did in the interest rate on the mortgage financing of the communities was increased effective june   and may be increased further in  which will have the effect of reducing cash flow from the communities and  correspondingly  reducing our additional management fee that is payable to the extent of of cash flow 
we also expect that additional communities could be sold  thereby reducing the number of communities subject to the management agreement 
because this management agreement can be terminated by either party on short notice  there can be no guaranty that the management arrangement will continue for its full term 
emeritrust ii communities management 
during through september   and  we managed the emeritrust ii communities  which included of the communities  under management agreements providing for a base management fee of of gross revenue generated by the communities and an additional management fee of  payable if we met certain cash flow standards 
the management agreement for five of the communities also required us to fund cash operating losses of those communities 
under this arrangement  we received management fees net of our funding obligations of approximately million in through september  and approximately million in each of the years and emeritrust ii communities lease 
on september   we acquired the emeritrust ii communities for a cash purchase price of million  financed through a combination of lease and mortgage financing with an independent real estate investment trust in the aggregate amount of million 
a master operating lease covers the emeritrust ii communities and four other communities originally leased from the real estate investment trust in march the lease is for an initial year period  with one year renewal  and grants us a right of first opportunity to purchase any of the emeritrust ii communities if the trust decides to sell 
the lease is a net lease  with annual base rent of million of which million is attributable to the emeritrust ii communities  and periodic escalators 
the real estate investment trust also provided million of debt financing secured by our leasehold interests in the emeritrust ii communities 
this debt was consolidated with other debt held by the real estate investment trust as described below under debt consolidation 
as part of the purchase price  we also agreed to issue to the emeritrust ii investors warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock  of which  shares have been issued 
the warrants expire september   and have an exercise price of subject to certain adjustments 
the holders have limited registration rights 
we included the fair value of these warrants  totaling approximately million  as lease acquisition costs that we will amortize over the life of the lease 
additional information 
the history and additional detail relating to transactions involving the emeritrust communities is contained in our form k filed with the securities and exchange commission on october  mr 
baty  our chief executive officer  held financial interests in the emeritrust investor groups and had certain obligations under the emeritrust financing arrangements and in the transactions completed in these are also described in detail in this form k 
repurchase of series a preferred stock in a two part transaction that was completed august   we repurchased all the outstanding shares of our series a preferred stock for an aggregate purchase price of million 
the series a preferred stock had been issued originally in october for million 
as a part of the repurchase  the holder of the series a preferred stock waived approximately million in accrued and unpaid dividends 
as a result of the transaction  we recognized a gain of approximately million 
just prior to the repurchase  the series a preferred stock was accruing compounded  cumulative dividends of approximately million annually  with mandatory redemption in october at a price of million plus accrued and unpaid dividends 
in completing the repurchase  we avoided these future obligations 
we obtained the funds to complete the repurchase through three related financing transactions 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the first financing transaction involved three communities that we leased 
prior to this financing transaction  we also held notes receivable in the aggregate amount of million that were secured by the same three communities and under which we received interest of approximately  annually 
in the refinancing  the communities were transferred to a real estate investment trust  which became the new owner and lessor  and we received net proceeds of million in repayment of the notes we held and in exchange for our related security and other property interests in the communities 
the transfer of the communities was subject to our leases  the terms of which did not change 
because we disposed of our notes  we will no longer receive the interest we formerly did 
we recognized a deferred gain of approximately million  which we will amortize over the remaining life of the leases 
the second financing transaction  with the same real estate investment trust  involved the sale leaseback of four communities  three of which we owned and one of which we held a joint venture interest  resulting in net proceeds of million 
the lease is for a year term with a year extension and provides for a base annual rent of approximately million  with periodic escalators 
prior to this refinancing  the communities secured mortgage financing of million  with annual interest payments of approximately million 
we recognized a deferred gain of million  which we will amortize over the term of the lease 
the third financing  again with the same real estate investment trust  was a mortgage loan for million secured by the seven communities involved in the first two financing transactions 
the debt matured in august and required monthly interest only payments at an initial rate of per annum  with periodic increases 
this mortgage debt was subsequently consolidated with other debt held by the real estate investment trust  as discussed below under debt consolidation 
lease of eight communities in may in may  we entered into a lease with a real estate investment trust covering eight assisted living communities in four states containing an aggregate of units 
the lease is for an initial year period with three year extensions and includes an option to acquire the communities during the second year for a price of million and during the third year at the same price plus a premium 
we believe this option exercise price is currently well above fair value based on current operations 
under the lease we have a right of first opportunity to purchase any of the properties if the owner decides to sell 
the lease is a net lease  with annual base rental of million  and rent adjustments at the end of the first and second lease years based on a percentage of any increase in operating revenues  with an aggregate annual limit of  and adjustments each year thereafter based on increases in the consumer price index 
the real estate investment trust has agreed to fund up to  for capital expenditures  with amounts added to the lease base and option price  and has provided us a year working capital loan for  with interest at per annum payable monthly 
lease of eight communities from baty on september   we entered into an agreement to lease eight communities that we were then managing for entities owned or controlled by mr 
baty  which we have formerly referred to as the horizon bay communities 
under the agreement  the baty entities assigned  and we assumed  the existing leases relating to seven of the facilities 
in lieu of acquiring the remaining community  which was owned by a baty entity subject to mortgage financing  we leased the community for a term of years  with rent equal to the debt service on the mortgage indebtedness including interest and principal plus of cash flow after accounting for assumed management fees and capital expenditures 
the debt that is secured by this community may be cross collateralized by mr 
baty with an emeritrust i community that he may acquire and lease to us  as described below 
annual rent relating to the eight communities is estimated at million  with annual adjustments based upon changes in the consumer price level index 
we will pay the baty entities approximately  which represents their cash investment plus per annum  as provided in the original agreement related to the management of these communities between the baty entities and us 
although this transaction closed december   the economic and financial terms were effective june  debt consolidation the real estate investment trust that financed the emeritrust ii transaction already held million of our leasehold mortgage debt that matured in march and bore interest at per annum  commencing march with periodic increases up to per annum 
this real estate investment trust also provided million in leasehold mortgage financing incurred to support management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the series a preferred stock repurchase in august on september   these two financings  together with the million leasehold mortgage financing related to the emeritrust ii communities  were consolidated into a single million leasehold mortgage financing  secured by the communities and maturing on june  the debt bears interest at an initial rate of per annum with periodic increases up to 
the consolidated loan requires monthly payments of interest the first year and monthly payments of principal and interest  based on a year amortization  thereafter 
additional principal reductions may occur  at our option  through the increase in the amount of the lease financing based on the portfolio achieving certain coverage ratios 
alterra transactions in december  we invested million representing an ownership interest  net of transaction costs  in a limited liability corporation llc that acquired alterra healthcare corporation  a national assisted living company headquartered in milwaukee  wisconsin that was the subject of a voluntary chapter bankruptcy 
alterra operated assisted living communities in states 
the purchase price for alterra was million and the transaction closed on december   following approval by the bankruptcy court 
the members of the llc consists of an affiliate of fortress investment group llc fortress  a new york based private equity fund  which is the managing member  an entity controlled by mr 
baty  and us 
under the llc agreement  distributions are first allocated to fortress until it receives its original investment of million together with a preferred return  and then are allocated to the three investors in proportion to their percentage interests  as defined in the agreement  which are a interest for fortress and a interest for each of us and the entity controlled by mr 
baty 
on december   independent of the llc  we acquired five assisted living communities  containing an aggregate of units  from alterra for the assumption of million of mortgage debt  which bears interest at per annum  provides for monthly payments of  including principal and interest  and matures august the following table summarizes the transactions described above owned leased managed december

includes two communities not elsewhere discussed management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued results of operations summary of significant accounting policies and use of estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to resident programs and incentives such as move in fees  bad debts  investments  intangible assets  impairment of long lived assets  income taxes  restructuring  long term service contracts  contingencies  self insured retention  health insurance  and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following accounting policies are most significant to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revisions in such estimates are charged to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
for commercial general liability and professional liability insurance  we use a captive insurance structure essentially to self fund our primary layer of insurance 
this policy is claims made based and covers losses and liabilities associated with general and professional liability 
the primary layer has per occurrence and aggregate limits 
within that primary layer is a self insured retention  which also has a per occurrence and aggregate limit 
we also have an excess policy  which applies to claims in excess of the primary layer on a per occurrence basis 
losses within the primary layer  which include the self insured retention  are accrued based upon actuarial estimates of the aggregate liability for claims incurred  which will vary based on actual versus expected experience 
for health insurance  we self insure up to a certain level for each occurrence above which a catastrophic insurance policy covers any additional costs 
health insurance expense is accrued based upon historical experience of the aggregate liability for claims incurred 
if these estimates are insufficient  additional charges may be required 
for workers compensation insurance for insured states excluding texas and compulsory state funds  we are on an incurred loss  retrospective insurance policy  retroactively adjusted  upward or downward  based upon total incurred loss experience 
the premium charged by the insurance underwriter is based upon a standard rate determined by the underwriter to cover  amongst other things  estimated losses and other fixed costs 
the difference between the premium charged and the actuarial based estimate of costs  which is expensed on a monthly basis  is carried as an asset on the balance sheet 
after the end of the policy year  the insurance company conducts an audit and adjusts the total premium based upon the actual payroll and actual incurred loss for the policy year 
any premium adjustment for the differences between estimated and actual payroll and estimated and actual losses will first be applied to the accrued asset and then as an adjustment to workers compensation expense at the time such adjustment is determined 
there is a reasonable expectation that the incurred loss adjustment will be downward  resulting in a premium refund 
the incurred loss adjustment is limited to of the standard premium with the initial adjustment six months after policy expiration on december   and annually thereafter 
for work related injuries in texas  we are a non subscriber  meaning that work related losses are covered under a defined benefit program outside of the texas workers compensation system 
losses are paid as incurred and estimated losses are accrued on a monthly basis 
we account for stock option awards to employees under the intrinsic value based method of accounting prescribed by apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
under this method  no compensation expense is recorded provided the exercise price is equal to or greater than the quoted market price of the stock at the grant date 
we make pro forma disclosures of net income and earnings per share as if the fair value based method of accounting the alternative method of accounting for stock based compensation had been applied as required by fas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
the fair value based method requires us to make assumptions to determine expected risk free interest rates  stock price volatility  dividend yield and weighted average option life 
to management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the extent  such things as actual volatility or life of the options is different from estimated  amounts expensed will be more or less than would have been recorded otherwise 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our residents to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our residents were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized which at this time shows a net asset valuation of zero 
we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
however  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made

for the year ended december   our operating income after interest expense increased to million from million for  primarily as a result of a combination of increased rates and decreased community operating expenses mainly due to improvements in taxes  licenses  and fees  insurance  and other operating expenses in compared to management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued liquidity and capital resources for the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities was million compared to million for the prior year 
the decrease in net loss of million between and was a major contributor to our increased operating cash flow 
increases in current liabilities provided cash of approximately million primarily due to an increase in accounts payable of million and an increase in deferred revenue of million  partially offset by decreases in other current liabilities of million 
net cash used by increases in current assets were approximately  primarily from increases in prepaid expenses 
net cash provided by investing activities amounted to million for the year ended december   and was comprised primarily of proceeds from sale of property and equipment of million  proceeds from sale of investment securities of million  repayment of advances to affiliates of million  which was partially offset by management and lease acquisition costs of million  a million investment in alterra  which includes transaction costs  acquisition of property and equipment of million  and the purchase of a minority partner s interest of million 
net cash provided by investing activities amounted to million for the year ended december   and was comprised primarily of proceeds from sale of property and equipment related to refinancing of four communities through sale leaseback transactions  which was partially offset by the acquisition of property  equipment  new leases  and lease improvements 
for the year ended december   net cash used in financing activities was million primarily from the repurchase of series a preferred stock for million  long term debt repayments of million  short term debt repayments of million  and an increase in restricted deposits of million  partially offset by proceeds from long term borrowings of million 
for the year ended december   net cash used in financing activities was million primarily from short term and long term debt repayments  and financing and debt issuance costs 
we have incurred significant operating losses since our inception and have a working capital deficit of million  although million represents deferred revenue and million of preferred dividends is due only if declared by our board of directors 
in   and  we reported positive net cash from operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
at times in the past  however  we have been dependent upon third party financing or disposition of assets to fund operations and we cannot guarantee that  if necessary in the future  such transactions will be available timely or at all  or on terms attractive to us 
in  we refinanced substantially all of our debt obligations  extending the maturities of such financings to dates in or thereafter  at which time we will need to refinance or otherwise repay the obligations 
as a consequence of our property acquisitions in  our long term debt has increased from million at december   to million at december   and our obligations under operating leases have increased from million to million during the same period 
in particular  the number of communities we lease increased from at december  to at december  we believe that  on the basis of the operating results of these communities many of which we managed prior to the commencement of the leases  the cash flow from such communities will be adequate to support the increased lease obligations 
many of our debt instruments and leases contain cross default provisions pursuant to which a default under one obligation can cause a default under one or more other obligations to the same lender or lessor 
such cross default provisions affect owned assisted living properties and operated under leases 
accordingly  any event of default could cause a material adverse effect on our financial condition if such debt or leases are cross defaulted 
we expect to be in compliance at least through and for the foreseeable future 
management believes that we will be able to sustain positive operating cash flow at least through and for the foreseeable future and will have adequate cash from operations for all necessary investing and financing activities including required debt service and capital expenditures 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december  in thousands payments due by period less than after total year years years years contractual obligations long term debt  including current portion     operating leases 












     convertible debentures 









  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued recent accounting pronouncements in june  fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
requires us to record the fair value of an asset retirement obligation as a liability in the period in which it incurs a legal obligation associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development  and or normal use of the assets 
we also record a corresponding asset that is depreciated over the life of the asset 
subsequent to the initial measurement of the asset retirement obligation  the obligation will be adjusted at the end of each period to reflect the passage of time and changes in the estimated future cash flows underlying the obligation 
we adopted sfas no 
on january  however  adoption of sfas no 
did not have an impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
 and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
sfas no 
amends existing guidance on reporting gains and losses on the extinguishment of debt to prohibit the classification of the gain or loss as extraordinary  as the use of such extinguishments have become part of the risk management strategy of many companies 
sfas no 
also amends sfas no 
to require sale leaseback accounting for certain lease modifications that have economic effects similar to sale leaseback transactions 
the provisions of the statement related to the rescission of statement no 
are applied in fiscal years beginning after may  the provisions of the statement related to statement no 
were effective for transactions occurring after may   with early application encouraged 
the adoption of sfas no 
in the fourth quarter of had no effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness to others  an interpretation of fasb statements no 
  and and a rescission of fasb interpretation no 
this interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under guarantees issued 
the interpretation also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions of the interpretation are applicable to guarantees issued or modified after december  the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  adoption of interpretation no 
did not have an impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
this interpretation was revised in december and addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities vie s 
a vie is subject to the consolidation provisions of fin no 
if it cannot support its financial activities without additional subordinated financial support from third parties or its equity investors lack any one of the following characteristics the ability to make decisions about its activities through voting rights  the obligation to absorb losses of the entity if they occur  or the right to receive residual returns of the entity if they occur 
fin no 
requires a vie to be consolidated by its primary beneficiary 
the primary beneficiary is the party that holds the variable interests that expose it to a majority of the entity s expected losses and or residual returns 
for purposes of determining a primary beneficiary  all related party interests must be combined with our actual interests in the vie 
the application of this interpretation is immediate for vie s created or altered after january   and is effective at the end of the first quarter of for variable interest entities that existed prior to february  we have evaluated the impact of fin no 
on all its current related party management agreements including those more fully discussed under item certain relationships and related transactions  under sections denoted as emeritrust transactions and baty transactions as well as other management agreements and other arrangements with potential vie s 
we doe not believe we have any vie s that will require consolidation 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
for public enterprises  like us  this statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  management has determined that none of our current financial instruments are covered by this pronouncement 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued impact of inflation to date  inflation has not had a significant impact on emeritus 
inflation could  however  affect our future revenues and operating income due to our dependence on the senior resident population  most of whom rely on relatively fixed incomes to pay for our services 
the monthly charges for the resident s unit and assisted living services are influenced by the location of the community and local competition 
our ability to increase revenues in proportion to increased operating expenses may be limited 
we typically do not rely to a significant extent on governmental reimbursement programs 
in pricing our services  we attempt to anticipate inflation levels  but there can be no assurance that we will be able to respond to inflationary pressures in the future 
risk factors our business  results of operations and financial condition are subject to many risks  including  but not limited to  those set forth below the following important factors  among others  could cause actual operating results to differ materially from those expressed in forward looking statements included in this report and presented elsewhere by our management from time to time 
do not place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date of this report 
a number of the matters and subject areas discussed in this report refer to potential future circumstances  operations and prospects  and therefore  are not historical or current facts 
the discussion of such matters and subject areas is qualified by the inherent risks and uncertainties surrounding future expectations  which may materially differ from our actual future experience involving any one or more of such matters and subject areas as a result of various factors  including possible excess assisted living capacity in our market areas affecting our occupancy and pricing levels  uncertainties in increasing occupancy and pricing  generally  effective management of costs and the effects of cost increases beyond our control  such as utilities and insurance  the difficulty in reducing and eliminating continuing operating losses  vulnerability to defaults in our debt and lease financing as a result of noncompliance with various covenants  the effects of cross default terms  competition  and uncertainties relating to construction  licensing  environmental  and other matters that affect acquisition  disposition and development of assisted living communities 
we have attempted to identify  in context  certain of the factors that may cause actual future experience and results to differ from our current expectations regarding the relevant matter or subject area 
we are not obligated to release publicly the results of any revisions to these forward looking statements that may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this report or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 
these and other factors are discussed in more detail below 
we have incurred losses since we began doing business and may continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future 
we organized and began operations in july and have operated at a loss since we began doing business 
for   and  we recorded net losses before preferred dividends of million  million  and million  respectively 
we believe that the historically aggressive growth of our portfolio through acquisitions and developments and related financing activities  as well as our inability along with much of the assisted living industry to increase occupancy rates at our communities  were among the causes of these losses 
to date  at many of our communities  we have been generally able to stabilize occupancy and rate structures to levels that have resulted in positive cash flow but not earnings for the company as a whole 
our operations may not become profitable in line with our current expectations or may not become profitable at all 
if we cannot generate sufficient cash flow to cover required interest  principal and lease payments  we risk defaults on our debt agreements and operating leases 
at december   we had total debt of million  with minimum principal payments of about million due in at december   we were obligated under long term operating leases requiring minimum annual lease payments of which million is payable in in addition  we will have approximately million and million in principal amount of debt repayment obligations that become due in and  respectively 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to make such payments as required and are unable to renegotiate payments or obtain additional equity or debt financing  a lender could foreclose on our communities secured by the respective indebtedness or  in the case of an operating lease  could terminate our lease  resulting in loss of income and asset value 
in some cases  our indebtedness is secured by a particular community and a pledge of our interests in a subsidiary entity that owns that community 
in the event of a default  a lender could avoid judicial procedures required to foreclose on real property by foreclosing on our pledge instead  thus accelerating its acquisition of that community 
furthermore  because of cross default and cross collateralization provisions in certain of our mortgage and sale leaseback agreements  if we default on one of our payment obligations  we could adversely affect a significant number of our communities 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued because we are highly leveraged  we may not be able to respond to changing business and economic conditions or continue with selected acquisitions 
a substantial portion of our future cash flow will be devoted to debt service and lease payments 
in the past  we have frequently been dependent on third party financing and disposition of assets to fund these obligations in full and we may be required to do so in the future 
in addition  we are periodically required to refinance these obligations as they mature 
as a consequence of acquisitions of communities  we have substantially increased our leverage in our long term debt has increased from million at december   to million at december  and our obligations under operating leases have increased from million to million during the same period 
these circumstances reduce our flexibility and ability to respond to our business needs  including changing business and financial conditions such as increasing interest rates and opportunities to expand our business through selected acquisitions 
we may be unable to increase or stabilize our occupancy rates that would result in positive earnings 
in previous years  we have been unable to increase our occupancy to levels that would result in net income on a sustained basis 
our historical losses have resulted  in part  from occupancy levels that were lower than anticipated when we acquired or developed our communities 
during the last three years  occupancy levels declined  although last year occupancy was nearly flat  excluding the effects of acquired communities 
we cannot guarantee that our occupancy levels will increase 
we will occasionally seek additional funding through public or private financing  including equity financing 
we may not find adequate equity  debt  or sale leaseback financing when we need it or on terms acceptable to us 
this could affect our ability to finance our operations or refinance our properties to avoid the consequences of default and foreclosure under our existing financing as described above 
in addition  if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  our shareholders may experience dilution of their investment 
if we fail to comply with financial covenants contained in our debt instruments  our lenders may accelerate the related debt 
from time to time  we failed to comply with certain covenants in our financing agreements 
in the future  we may not be able to comply with these covenants  which generally relate to matters such as cash flow  and debt coverage ratios 
if we fail to comply with any of these requirements  our lenders could accelerate the related indebtedness so that it becomes due and payable prior to its stated due date 
we may be unable to pay or refinance this debt if it becomes due 
our liability insurance may be insufficient to cover the liabilities we face 
in recent years  participants in the long term care industry have faced an increasing number of lawsuits alleging negligence  malpractice  or other related legal theories 
many of these suits involve large claims and significant legal costs 
we expect that we occasionally will face such suits because of the nature of our business 
we currently maintain insurance policies with coverage and self insured retention with respect to general and professional liability and deductibles with respect to auto liability and property damage claims we deem appropriate based on the nature and risks of our business  historical experience  industry standards  and the availability of insurance 
we could incur liability in excess of our insurance coverage or experience claims not covered by our insurance  including punitive damages 
claims against us  regardless of their merit or eventual outcome  may also undermine our ability to attract residents or expand our business and would require management to devote time to matters unrelated to the operation of our business 
our liability insurance policies must be renewed annually  and we may not be able to obtain liability insurance coverage in the future or  if available  on acceptable terms 
during the past several years  retained losses relating to high self insured retention and annual premiums have increased significantly  which have substantially compounded our costs associated with insurance and claims defense 
we face risks associated with selective acquisitions 
we intend to continue to seek selective acquisition opportunities 
however  we may not succeed in identifying any future acquisition opportunities or completing any identified acquisitions 
the acquisition of communities presents a number of risks 
existing residences available for acquisition may frequently serve or target different market segments than those we presently serve 
it may be necessary in these cases to reposition and renovate acquired residences or turn over the existing resident population to achieve a resident care level and income profile that is consistent with our objectives 
in the past  these obstacles have delayed the achievement of acceptable occupancy levels and increased operating and capital expenditures 
as a consequence  we currently plan to target assisted living communities with established operations  which could reduce the number of acquisitions we can complete and increase the expected cost 
even in these acquisitions  however  we may need to make staff and operating management personnel changes to successfully integrate acquired communities into our existing operations 
we may not succeed in repositioning acquired communities or in effecting any management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued necessary operational or structural changes and improvements on a timely basis 
we also may face unforeseen liabilities attributable to the prior operator of the acquired communities  against whom we may have little or no recourse 
we expect competition in our industry to increase  which could cause our occupancy rates and resident fees to decline 
the long term care industry is highly competitive  and given the relatively low barriers to entry and continuing health care cost containment pressures  we expect that our industry will become increasingly competitive in the future 
we believe that the industry is experiencing over capacity in several of our markets  thereby intensifying competition and adversely affecting occupancy levels and pricing 
we compete with other companies providing assisted living services as well as numerous other companies providing similar service and care alternatives  such as home healthcare agencies  independent living facilities  retirement communities  and skilled nursing facilities 
we expect that competition will increase from new market entrants  as assisted living residences receive increased market awareness and more states decide to include assisted living services in their medicaid programs 
many of these competitors may have substantially greater financial resources than we do 
increased competition may limit our ability to attract or retain residents or maintain our existing rate structures 
this could lead to lower occupancy rates or lower rate structures in our communities 
we also cannot predict the effect of the healthcare industry trend toward managed care on the assisted living marketplace 
managed care  an arrangement whereby service and care providers agree to sell specifically defined services to public or private payers in an effort to achieve more efficiency with respect to utilization and cost  is not currently a significant factor in the assisted living marketplace 
however  managed care plans sponsored by insurance companies or hmos may in the future affect pricing and the range of services provided in the assisted living marketplace 
if development of new assisted living facilities outpaces demand  we may experience decreased occupancy  depressed margins  and diminished operating results 
we believe that some assisted living markets have become or are on the verge of becoming overbuilt 
the barriers to entry in the assisted living industry are not substantial 
consequently  the development of new assisted living facilities could outpace demand 
overbuilding in the markets in which we operate could thus cause us to experience decreased occupancy and depressed margins and could otherwise adversely affect our operating results 
market forces could undermine our efforts to attract seniors with sufficient resources 
we rely on our residents abilities to pay our fees from their own or familial financial resources 
generally  only seniors with income or assets meeting or exceeding the comparable median in the region where our assisted living communities are located can afford our fees 
inflation or other circumstances may undermine the ability of seniors to pay for our services 
if we encounter difficulty in attracting seniors with adequate resources to pay for our services  our occupancy rates may decline and we may suffer losses that could cause the value of your investment in our stock to decline 
our labor costs may increase and may not be matched by corresponding increases in rates we charge to our residents 
we compete with other providers of assisted living services and long term care in attracting and retaining qualified and skilled personnel 
we depend on our ability to attract and retain management personnel responsible for the day to day operations of each of our residences 
if we are unable to attract or retain qualified residence management personnel  our results of operations may suffer 
in addition  possible shortages of nurses or trained personnel may require us to enhance our wage and benefits packages to compete in the hiring and retention of personnel 
we also depend on the available labor pool of semi skilled and unskilled employees in each of the markets in which we operate 
as a result of these and other factors  our labor costs may increase and may not be matched by corresponding increases in rates we charge to our residents 
we face possible environmental liabilities at each of our properties 
under various federal  state  and local environmental laws  ordinances  and regulations  a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be held liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances  including asbestos containing materials that could be located on  in or under its property 
these laws and regulations often impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of  or was responsible for  the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances 
we could face substantial costs of any required remediation or removal of these substances  and our liability typically is not limited under applicable laws and regulations 
our liability could exceed our properties value or the value of our assets 
we may be unable to sell or rent our properties  or borrow using our properties as collateral  if any of these substances is present or if we fail to remediate them properly 
under these laws and regulations  if we arrange for the disposal of hazardous or toxic substances such as asbestos containing materials at a disposal site  we also may be management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued liable for the costs of the removal or of the hazardous or toxic substances at the disposal site 
in addition to liability for these costs  we could be liable for governmental fines and injuries to persons or properties 
some of our facilities generate infectious medical waste due to the illness or physical condition of the residents  including  for example  blood soaked bandages  swabs  and other medical waste products  and incontinence products of those residents diagnosed with an infectious disease 
the management of infectious medical waste  including handling  storage  transportation  treatment  and disposal  is subject to regulation under various laws  including federal and state environmental laws 
these environmental laws set forth the management requirements  as well as permit  record keeping  notice  and reporting obligations 
each of our facilities has an agreement with a waste management company for the proper disposal of all infectious medical waste 
any finding that we are not in compliance with these environmental laws could adversely affect our business and financial condition 
because these environmental laws are amended from time to time  we cannot predict when and to what extent liability may arise 
in addition  because these environmental laws vary from state to state  expansion of our operations to states where we do not currently operate may subject us to additional restrictions on the manner in which we operate our facilities 
our chief executive officer has personal interest that may conflict with ours due to his interest in holiday retirement corporation and columbia pacific group  inc mr 
baty  our chief executive officer  is a principal shareholder  director  and chairman of the board of holiday retirement corporation  and is the principal owner of columbia pacific group  inc substantially all of the independent living facilities operated by holiday are owned by partnerships that are controlled by mr 
baty and holiday 
mr 
baty s varying financial interests and responsibilities include the acquisition  financing  and refinancing of independent living facilities and the development and construction of  and capital raising activities to finance  new facilities 
columbia pacific and affiliated partnerships operate assisted living communities and independent living facilities  many of which we manage under various management agreements 
the financial interests and management and financing responsibilities of mr 
baty with respect to holiday and columbia pacific and their affiliated partnerships could present conflicts of interest with us  including potential competition for residents in markets where both companies operate and competing demands for the time and efforts of mr 
baty 
because mr 
baty is both our chief executive officer as well as holiday s chairman of the board and is the principal owner of columbia pacific  circumstances could arise that would distract him from our operations 
our interests and those of holiday and columbia pacific interests may  on some occasions  be incompatible 
we have entered into a noncompetition agreement with mr 
baty  but this noncompetition agreement does not limit mr 
baty s current role with holiday or its related partnerships  so long as assisted living is only an incidental component of holiday s operation or management of independent living facilities 
we have entered into agreements with a number of entities that are owned or controlled by mr 
baty  whose interests with respect to these companies occasionally may conflict with ours 
we have entered into agreements  including most of our management agreements  with a number of entities that are owned or controlled by mr 
baty 
under these agreements  we provide management and other services to senior housing and assisted living communities owned by these entities and we have material agreements with these entities relating to the purchase  sale  and financing of a number of our operating communities 
there is a risk that the administration of these and any future arrangements could be adversely affected by these continuing relationships because our interest and those of mr 
baty may not be consistent at all times 
some of our recent transactions and the operations of certain communities that we manage are supported financially by mr 
baty with limited guarantees and through his direct and indirect ownership of such communities  we would be unable to benefit from these transactions and managed communities without this support 
our recent transactions to lease an additional communities and our agreements to manage communities involve limited guarantees by mr 
baty and rely on his direct and indirect ownership of the communities involved 
we believe that we would be unable to take advantage of these transactions and management opportunities without mr 
baty s individual and financial support 
the ongoing administration of these transactions  however  could be adversely affected by these continuing relationships because our interests and those of mr 
baty may not be consistent at all times 
in addition  we cannot guarantee that such support will be available in the future 
we may be unable to attract and retain key management personnel 
we depend upon  and will continue to depend upon  the services of mr 
baty  our chief executive officer 
the loss of mr 
baty s services  in part or in whole  could adversely affect our business and our results of operations 
mr 
baty has financial interests and management responsibilities with respect to holiday and its related partnerships 
as a result  he does not devote his full time and efforts to emeritus 
we may be unable to attract and retain other qualified executive personnel critical to the success of our business 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued our costs of compliance with government regulations may significantly increase in the future 
federal  state  and local authorities heavily regulate the healthcare industry 
regulations change frequently  and sometimes require us to make expensive changes in our operations 
a number of legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to long term care are proposed or under study at both the federal and state levels that  if enacted or adopted  could adversely affect our business and operating results 
we cannot predict to what extent legislative or regulatory initiatives will be enacted or adopted or what effect any initiative would have on our business and operating results 
changes in applicable laws and new interpretations of existing laws can significantly affect our operations  as well as our revenues  particularly those from governmental sources  and our expenses 
our residential communities are subject to varying degrees of regulation and licensing by local and state health and social service agencies and other regulatory authorities 
while these regulations and licensing requirements often vary significantly from state to state  they typically address fire safety  sanitation  staff training  staffing patterns  living accommodations such as room size  number of bathrooms  and ventilation  and health related services 
we may be unable to satisfy all regulations and requirements or to acquire and maintain any required licenses on a cost effective basis 
in addition  with respect to our residents who receive financial assistance from governmental sources for their assisted living services  we are subject to federal and state regulations that prohibit certain business practices and relationships 
failure to comply with these regulations could prevent reimbursement for our healthcare services under medicaid or similar state reimbursement programs 
our failure to comply with such regulations also could result in fines and the suspension or inability to renew our operating licenses 
federal  state  and local governments occasionally conduct unannounced investigations  audits  and reviews to determine whether violations of applicable rules and regulations exist 
devoting management and staff time and legal resources to such investigations  as well as any material violation by us that is discovered in any such investigation  audit or review  could strain our resources and affect our profitability 
in addition  regulatory oversight of construction efforts associated with refurbishment could cause us to lose residents and disrupt community operations 
our stock price has been highly volatile  and a number of factors may cause our common stock price to decline 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated and could fluctuate significantly in the future in response to various factors and events  including  but not limited to the liquidity of the market for our common stock  variations in our operating results  variations from analysts expectations  and new statutes or regulations  or changes in the interpretation of existing statutes or regulations  affecting the healthcare industry generally or the assisted living residence business in particular 
in addition  the stock market in recent years has experienced broad price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
these market fluctuations also may cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
our share ownership and certain other factors may impede a proposed takeover of our business 
as of february   mr 
baty  our chief executive officer  controls about of our outstanding common stock 
together  our directors and executive officers own  directly and indirectly  over of the voting power of our outstanding common and preferred stock 
accordingly  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued mr 
baty and the other members of our board and management would have significant influence over the outcome of matters submitted to our shareholders for a vote  including matters that would involve a change of control of emeritus 
further  our articles of incorporation require a two thirds supermajority vote to approve a business combination of emeritus with another company that is not approved by the board of directors 
accordingly  the current management group and board of directors could prevent approval of such a business combination 
we currently have a staggered board in which only one third of the board stands for election each year 
thus  absent removals and resignations  a complete change in board membership could not be accomplished in fewer than approximately two calendar years 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the table below provides information about our financial instruments entered into for purposes other than trading that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
for our debt obligations  the table presents principal repayments in thousands of dollars and current weighted averages of interest rates on these obligations as of december  for our debt obligations with variable interest rates  the rates presented reflect the current rates in effect at the end of these rates are based on libor plus margins ranging from to expected maturity date in thousands average fair interest thereafter total value rate long term debt fixed rate 

       variable rate      our earnings are affected by changes in interest rates as a result of our short term and long term borrowings 
we manage this risk by obtaining fixed rate borrowings when possible 
at december   our variable rate borrowings totaled approximately million 
currently  all our variable rate borrowings are based upon libor  subject to a libor floor ranging from to 
as of december   the libor rates were below the floor 
if libor interest rates were to average more  our annual interest expense and net loss would increase approximately  with respect to our variable rate borrowings 
this amount is determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our outstanding variable rate borrowings as of december   and does not consider changes in the actual level of borrowings that may occur subsequent to december  if libor rates should increase above the floor  we will be exposed to higher interest expense costs 
this analysis also does not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment  nor does it consider actions that management might be able to take with respect to our financial structure to mitigate the exposure to such a change
