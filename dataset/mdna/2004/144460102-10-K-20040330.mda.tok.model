overview we design  manufacture and sell next generation broadband access communications equipment to wireline and wireless communications service providers 
we were incorporated in september as a successor company to koenig communications  inc  an equipment systems integration and consulting company which had been in operation since in the summer of  we ceased our systems integration and consulting business and commenced our main product sales with the commercial deployment of our first network access products  
table of contents which was followed by the introduction of our wide bank products in november  access navigator products in january  adit products in december  the broadmore products in october  which we acquired from litton network access systems  inc  or lnas  and the axxius products in june in november we acquired the master series and broadway product lines through our acquisition of paragon networks international  inc during the late s  a substantial number of service providers  including clecs  invested heavily in network infrastructure and service delivery projects  which accelerated growth in the telecommunications equipment market 
by  when our annual net revenues reached million  we relied on a limited number of clecs for a significant portion of our net revenue 
however  starting in late  many of these clecs encountered sharp declines in the amount of capital they had available to fund network infrastructure and service delivery projects 
as a result  there was a significant decline in the demand for telecommunications equipment  including demand for our products 
we have since broadened our product portfolio into new markets  including wireless service providers and incumbent wireline carriers 
for example  in  of our net revenue was derived from clecs  from ilecs  and from wireless service providers compared to  and  respectively  in currently  the wireless and ilec markets are dominated by a small number of large companies  and we continue to rely upon a small number of customers in these markets for a significant portion of our revenue 
for example  we believe that tmobile usa  inc  a wireless service provider  both directly and indirectly through our oem channel  accounted for of our net revenue for the year ended december  when the downturn in the telecommunications industry adversely affected our net revenue and operating results in late  we reduced our operating expenses in an effort to better position our business for the long term 
in december  we completed a restructuring plan designed to reduce our expenses and align our workforce and operations to be more in line with anticipated net revenues 
as a result of the restructuring plan  we recorded a million restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of this charge was comprised of million for future rent payments related to facility closures and downsizing and  for salary related expenses due to reductions in our workforce 
our objective has been to focus on cost controls while continuing to invest in the development of new and enhanced products  which we believe will position us to take advantage of sales opportunities as economic conditions improve and demand recovers  a trend that we have started to see over the past six months 
however  we believe current economic conditions may continue to cause our customers and potential customers to defer and reduce capital spending 
historically  most of the sales of our products have been through a limited number of distributors 
for example  as a percentage of net revenue  walker associates accounted for in  in  and in recently  however  an increasing proportion of our products sales have been made directly to telecommunications service providers and oems 
for example  for the year ended december   nortel  an oem  accounted for of net revenue and we sold directly to two service providers  t mobile and xo communications  inc  which accounted for and of our net revenue  respectively 
we expect that the sale of our products will continue to be made to a small number of distributors  oems  and direct customers 
as a result  the loss of  or reduction of sales to  any of these customers would have a material adverse effect on our business 
our net revenue continues to be affected by the timing and number of orders for our products  which continue to vary from quarter to quarter due to factors such as demand for our products  economic conditions  and the financial stability and ordering patterns of our direct customers  distributors  and oems 
in addition  a significant portion of our net revenue has been derived from a limited number of large orders  and we believe that this trend will continue in the future  especially if the percentage of oem and direct sales to customers continues to increase since such customers typically place larger orders than our distributors 
the timing of such orders and our ability to fulfill them have caused material fluctuations in our operating results  and we anticipate that such fluctuations will continue in the future 

table of contents recent developments on november   we completed the acquisition of paragon networks international inc  a provider of wireless transport products to mobile wireless operators worldwide 
in exchange for all outstanding shares of paragon capital stock  we issued  shares of our common stock and distributed  in cash to the paragon stockholders 
as of the closing of the acquisition  the aggregate value of the consideration that we issued to the paragon stockholders was approximately million 
all outstanding paragon options and warrants were cancelled as part of the transaction 
we accounted for the acquisition using the purchase method of accounting 
in addition to the consideration that we issued in exchange for the outstanding shares of paragon capital stock  we will pay an aggregate of approximately million in cash to paragon employees 
results of operations years ended december   and year ended december  in thousands net revenue cost of goods sold our net revenue for increased to million from million in the increase in net revenue in was due to increases in the number of units sold into the wireless market 
we believe that the increase in units sold in was partially due to the deployment by some wireless carriers of our axxius  adit and masterseries products to comply with fcc mandated e location services and expand cell site bandwidth capacity 
the acquisition of paragon in november contributed to the increase in our wireless market revenue  primarily because of the masterseries product 
our net revenue also improved due to a slight economic recovery and the lessening of capital market constraints in the telecommunications sector in our net revenue for decreased to million from million for the year ended december  the decrease in net revenue in was due to decreases in the number of units of our products sold and price decreases in some of our products  which were primarily caused by overall economic weakness and capital market constraints impacting telecommunication service providers and continued downturns in the telecommunications sector in a significant portion of our net revenue has been derived from a limited number of large orders  and we believe that this trend will continue in the future  especially if the percentage of direct sales to end users increases 
in  and  of our net revenue was derived from  and orders  respectively 
ten customers placed these orders over those years 
these customers include adc  walker associates and xo  each of which contributed at least of our net revenue in at least one of those periods 
we have experienced a substantial decrease in the number of orders from some of these customers as a result of decreases in their capital spending budgets and the impact of adverse economic conditions both in general and in the telecommunications equipment industry in particular  which has resulted in decreased demand for telecommunications equipment during this period 
in order to maintain or grow our net revenue  as well as offset the loss of anticipated net revenue from some of our prior customers  we will need to sell more products to both our remaining customers and new customers  and we can provide no assurance that we will be able to make such sales 
our net revenue was and continues to be affected by the timing and quantities of orders for our products which may vary from quarter to quarter in the future  as they have in the past  due to factors such as demand for our products  economic conditions  bankruptcies of our customers and distributors  and ordering patterns of distributors  oems and other direct customers 
we believe that this trend could continue in the future  especially if the percentage of direct sales to end users increases 
the timing of customer orders and our ability to fulfill them can cause material fluctuations in our operating results  and we anticipate that such fluctuations will occur in the future 
during  approximately of our revenue was derived from the sales of our products through our distributors and oems 
our success depends in part on the continued sales and customer support efforts of our 
table of contents network of distributors and oems as well as increased sales to our direct customers 
in  walker associates  a distributor  accounted for of net revenue and nortel  an oem  accounted for of net revenue 
we expect that the sale of our products will continue to be made to a small number of distributors 
accordingly  the loss of  or a reduction in sales to  any of our key distributors or oems could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition to being dependent on a small number of distributors and oems for a majority of our net revenue  we believe that our products are distributed to a limited number of service provider customers 
two of these service provider end user customers  t mobile and xo communications  inc  accounted for and of our net revenue  respectively  for the year ended december  a decrease in sales to either t mobile or xo communications could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we believe that our revenue will increase in as we will have a full year of revenue from the broadway and masterseries products acquired with the paragon acquisition  and as wireless carriers continue their expansion of cell sites and continue to deploy data services into cell sites for e location services and other bandwidth intensive applications like pictures or streaming video 
additionally we believe the acceptance and deployment of voice over ip services will continue to increase throughout the year 
cost of goods sold for was million compared to million in and million for the increase in was due to increased sales and was partially offset by charges of million taken in for slow moving and excess inventory 
the decrease in was primarily attributable to decreased product shipments  partially influenced by cost reductions in existing product platforms  and partially offset by charges taken in for slow moving and excess inventory 
year ended december  in thousands gross profit gross margin gross profit in increased to million from a gross profit of million in this increase was caused by the increased shipments of our products in and by charges taken for slow moving and excess inventory in gross margin increased to in from in gross margin increases were also attributable to changes in product mix  as gross margins vary among products  product cost reductions and higher production volumes  and were partially offset by decreases in selling prices 
our gross profit for was million  a decrease of million from the gross profit of million in gross margin decreased to in from in the decrease in gross margin was driven primarily by reduced revenues and charges taken for slow moving and excess inventory 
gross margins were also impacted by changes in the mix of products sold  as gross margins vary among products  increased production volumes  decreases in selling prices  product cost reductions  and decreased overhead expenses 
we believe that gross margins could continue to increase in if sales of our products increase and if we are able to reduce the cost of our products at a greater rate than anticipated price reductions  or if we are able to gain manufacturing efficiencies by consolidating our production facilities 
new product introductions could potentially harm gross margins until production volumes increase 
we believe that average selling prices and gross margins for our products will decline as such products mature  as volume price discounts in distributor contracts and direct sales relationships take effect  and as competition intensifies  among other factors 
for example  the average selling price for the wide bank products and adit products has decreased in the past two years 
these decreases were due to unfavorable general economic conditions and the introduction of competitive products 
in addition  discounts to distributors vary among product lines and are based on volume shipments  each of which affects gross margins 
as a result  we believe that our gross margins are likely to fluctuate in the future based on product mix and channel mix 
furthermore  gross margins may decrease from time to time as a result of new product introductions by our competitors and us 

table of contents year ended december  in thousands research and development expenses as a percentage of net revenue research and development expenses for decreased to million from million in mostly due to a million decrease in personnel expense due to reductions in work force 
there were also decreases of million for depreciation expense  million in expense for technical certification programs and million decrease in prototyping expenses 
depreciation decreased as we took assets out of service in late and telcordia certification decreased due to a one time expense in related to our wide bank product 
we believe that research and development expenses will increase in the first quarter of as we absorb the research and development department from the paragon acquisition and as we continue to develop new product platforms and service cards for our existing platforms 
research and development expenses for decreased to million from million in primarily as a result of a million decrease in personnel expense and a million decrease in prototyping expense 
personnel expense in the past two years decreased as we reduced employees in order to reduce operating expenses 
prototyping expense decreased in the past two years as we completed and reduced the number of product development programs 
year ended december  in thousands sales and marketing expenses general and administrative expenses goodwill and intangible asset amortization bad debt expense recoveries asset impairment charges restructuring charge total selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenue selling  general and administrative expense for decreased to million from million in sales and marketing expense for decreased to million from million in primarily as a result of a million decrease in personnel expense  a  decrease in travel and entertainment expense  a  decrease in expenses for demonstration equipment and a  decrease in communication expense 
most of the decreases in sales and marketing expenses were the result of the reduction in sales and marketing personnel that occurred in the early part of and the expenses related to their sales and marketing activities 
we anticipate that sales and marketing expenses will increase in as we increased our sales and marketing department with the acquisition of paragon 
we are also increasing marketing activities in some targeted markets 
general and administrative expense for decreased to million from million in the decrease was primarily attributable to a million expense for legal and settlement costs incurred in as well as a million decrease in personnel cost and a  decrease in professional fees 
bad debt expense went from a million expense in to a million recovery in in  a number of our customers filed for bankruptcy and one of our distributors was experiencing financial difficulties which caused a significant amount of accounts receivables to become delinquent 
in  we were able to recover some of the delinquent receivables and part of the accounts receivable related to the bankruptcy 
we also incurred an asset impairment charge related to goodwill of million and a restructuring charge of million in selling  general and administrative expenses for increased to million from million in sales and marketing expense for decreased to million from million in primarily as a result of a million decrease in personnel expense  a  decrease in recruiting expense and a  decrease in advertising expense 
general and administrative expenses for increased to million from 
table of contents million in primarily as a result of a million payment for a settlement to an inventory purchasing dispute  partially offset by a  decrease in personnel expense 
year ended december  in thousands interest and other income  net income taxes benefit interest and other income  net for decreased to  from  in the decrease was due to lower interest income earned due to lower interest rates 
we believe that net interest and other income will increase substantially in due to increased cash and cash equivalent balances from our public stock offering that we completed in february  which resulted in net proceeds of million 
interest and other income  net for decreased to  from million in the decrease of  was due to interest income earned on lower cash and cash equivalent balances as well as lower interest rates 
for  our effective combined federal and state income tax rate was a negative compared to an income tax rate of negative and for and  respectively 
in the second quarter of  we determined that it was not more likely than not  based on our taxable losses  projections of future taxable income and the reversal of deferred tax liabilities  that our deferred tax assets would be realized 
as a result  we recorded a valuation allowance of million reducing the carrying amount of our deferred tax assets to zero 
we recorded an additional valuation allowance of million in the second half of and  in to reduce the additional deferred tax assets generated during that period 
in  we realized a tax benefit from research and experimentation tax credits  which increased the effective rate of the tax benefit in although we may be profitable in  we do not believe that we will experience any income tax expense in our net operating loss carryforwards may be used to offset up to million of future taxable income for federal tax purposes and up to million for state tax purposes 
as these net operating loss carryforwards are utilized  we will reduce the related valuation allowance 
reductions in the valuation allowance  if any  will be recognized in our statements of operations as an income tax benefit  and may offset any current income tax expense 
in addition  should we demonstrate a history of sustained profitability  we may reverse all or a significant portion of the remaining valuation allowance 
liquidity and capital resources december  december  working capital cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities total assets years ended december  net cash provided used by operating activities investing activities financing activities at december   our principal sources of liquidity included cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities available for sale of approximately million 
at december   our working capital was approximately million 
we have no significant capital spending or purchase commitments other than facilities leases 
subsequent to december   we completed a stock offering  which generated additional cash of approximately million 

table of contents cash provided by operations was million for the year ended december  contrasted by million used in operations in the million change was primarily due to our net income in of million combined with the receipt of our income tax refund of million compared with our net loss of million in this was partially offset by decreases in non cash charges for depreciation  asset impairments  provisions for doubtful accounts and obsolete inventory  and deferred tax expense 
increases in accounts receivable were substantially offset by the increase in accounts payable 
cash used by investing activities for the year ended december  was million compared to  for the year ended december  for the year ended december   we had net purchases of million of marketable securities compared to net sales of million for the year ended december  we acquired million of cash in connection with our acquisition of paragon  net of cash used for the acquisition 
our capital expenditures for the year ended december  were  for equipment to support research  development  and manufacturing activities compared to million for the year ended december  we believe our current facilities are sufficient to meet our current operating requirements 
capital expenditures in are expected to exceed those of as we invest to support research  development and production tooling 
net cash from financing activities provided million for the year ended december   which was the result of cash received upon the exercise of stock options  compared to  for the year ended december  our net inventory levels increased approximately million to million at december  from million at december  the increase was primarily the result of the fulfillment of a million purchase commitment  which was satisfied in june of  and million from the acquisition of paragon offset by the shipment of products 
we anticipate that inventory levels will decline in  as we have decreased our purchasing and continue to ship out of our current inventory 
we believe that our existing cash and investment balances are adequate to fund our projected working capital and capital expenditure requirements for a period greater than months 
although operating activities may provide cash in certain periods  to the extent we experience growth in the future  we anticipate that our operating and investing activities may use cash 
we may consider using our capital to make strategic investments  acquisitions of companies  or to acquire or license technology or products 
however  we cannot assure you that additional funds or capital will be available to us in adequate amounts and with reasonably acceptable terms 
contractual obligations the company leases office space under various noncancelable operating leases that expire through the company also leases copiers under various capital leases which expire in the impact that our contractual obligations as of december  are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods is as follows in thousands payments due by period less more than than total year years years years operating leases purchase obligations total the company records rent expense under noncancelable operating leases using the straight line method after consideration of increases in rental payments over the lease term  and records the difference between actual payments and rent expense as deferred rent concessions 
the company has placed non cancellable purchase orders for million of inventory from certain of its vendors for delivery in purchase orders are generally placed up to months in advance based on the lead time of the inventory 

table of contents rent expense for the years ended december    and totaled million  and million  and million respectively 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue and product returns  inventory valuations  allowance for doubtful accounts  intangible assets  deferred income taxes and warranty reserves 
we use historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances as a basis for making estimates about the carrying value of assets and liabilities and other items that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we consider the following accounting areas to have the most significant impact on the reported financial results and financial position of our company 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue from product sales at the time of shipment and passage of title using guidance from sec staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by staff accounting bulletin no 
our revenue from sales of products is recognized upon shipment based upon our shipping terms  provided that we have evidence of an arrangement  the fee is fixed and collectibility is probable 
we offer certain of our customers the right to return products for a limited time after shipment as part of a stock rotation program 
we estimate future stock rotation returns based upon actual historical return rates and reduce our revenue by these estimated returns 
if future returns exceed our estimates  revenue would be further reduced 
inventory reserves 
we value our inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase and or manufacture or the current estimated net realizable value of inventory 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than our estimates  then additional inventory write downs may be required 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust open account status based upon payment history and the customer s current creditworthiness  as determined by our review of current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon the age of outstanding invoices and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have usually been within our expectations and the provisions established  we did recover a significant portion of aged receivables in that we had previously provided for 
this recovery amounted to approximately million 
we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
because our accounts receivable are concentrated in a relatively few number of customers  a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one of these customers could have a material impact on our ability to collect our accounts receivable and  accordingly  on our future operating results 
valuation of intangible assets 
we regularly evaluate the potential impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets 
in assessing whether the value of our goodwill and other intangibles has been impaired  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of these assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record additional impairment charges 

table of contents deferred income taxes 
current income tax expense benefit represents actual or estimated amounts payable or receivable on tax return filings each year 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the accompanying balance sheets  and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities for the period determines the deferred tax provision or benefit for the period 
effects of changes in enacted tax laws on deferred tax assets and liabilities are reflected as adjustments to the tax provision or benefit in the period of enactment 
a valuation allowance is required to reduce the carrying amount of deferred tax assets if management cannot conclude that realization of such assets is more likely than not at the balance sheet date 
based upon our recent history of losses and an analysis of projected net taxable income for future operating periods  we determined that realization of our tax net operating loss carryforwards  tax credit carryforwards and other deferred tax assets is not sufficiently assured 
based upon this analysis  a valuation allowance was established 
warranty reserves 
we offer warranties of various lengths to our customers depending on the specific product and the terms of our customer purchase agreements 
our standard warranties require us to repair or replace defective product returned to us during the warranty period at no cost to the customer 
we record an estimate for warranty related costs based on our actual historical return rates and repair costs at the time of sale 
on an on going basis  management reviews these estimates against actual expenses and makes adjustments when necessary 
while our warranty costs have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same warranty return rates or repair costs that we have in the past 
a significant increase in products return rates or the costs to repair our products could have a material adverse impact on our operating results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position  results of operations or cash flows due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices and interest rates 
historically  and as of december   we have had little or no exposure to market risk in the area of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates as measured against the united states dollar 
historically  and as of december   we have not used derivative instruments or engaged in hedging activities
