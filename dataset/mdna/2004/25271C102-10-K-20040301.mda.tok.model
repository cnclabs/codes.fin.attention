item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements including the notes thereto in item of this report 
overview industry conditions the offshore drilling industry continues to be extremely competitive  and demand for the company s drilling services remains challenging 
the company had all of its actively marketed deep and mid water semisubmersibles in the us gulf of mexico us gom operating during at least part of the fourth quarter of however  these semisubmersibles continue to work under well to well contracts and dayrates are currently flat 
for the company s jack up fleet in the us gom  dayrates and utilization improved significantly during compared to and this market continues to do well as the effect of high gas prices and the repositioning of jack ups to the mexican gulf of mexico have had a positive effect 
however  the company can make no assurances that these favorable market conditions will persist 
in the north sea  the company has two of its three semisubmersibles committed through most of and a fourth north sea rig  the ocean nomad has moved to west africa where it is contracted to operate through the middle of the year 
the company is actively pursuing opportunities for the ocean vanguard  which is currently stacked at invergordon 
in southeast asia  all of the company s semisubmersibles are committed through mid year 
in addition  the ocean sovereign  a jack up  will operate in indonesia through the end of the first quarter  and the ocean heritage has mobilized to ecuador where it is operating under a three well contract 
in brazil  the company renewed its contracts for two of its semisubmersibles  although the renewal dayrates for the ocean yatzy and the ocean winner were lower than previous contracts that were set during a peak market cycle 
both of these semisubmersibles will begin required surveys during the first quarter of the company also successfully renewed the contract for the ocean clipper drillship in brazil at the same dayrate as the unit s previous contract 
all of the new brazilian contracts are for days each 
although the company is encouraged by the currently favorable outlook in its international markets  the company offers no assurance that a favorable outcome will be achieved 
results of operations revenues 
the company s revenues vary based upon demand  which affects the number of days the fleet is utilized and the dayrates earned 
when a rig is idle  generally no dayrate is earned and revenues will decrease as a result 
revenues can also increase or decrease as a result of the acquisition or disposal of rigs  required surveys and shipyard upgrades 
in order to improve utilization or realize higher dayrates  the company may mobilize its rigs from one market to another 
however  during periods of unpaid mobilization  revenues may be adversely affected 
as a response to changes in demand  the company may withdraw a rig from the market by cold stacking it or may reactivate a rig stacked previously  which may decrease or increase revenues  respectively 
revenues from dayrate drilling contracts are recognized currently 
the company may receive lump sum payments in connection with specific contracts 
such payments are recognized as revenues over the term of the related drilling contract 
mobilization revenues  in excess of costs incurred to mobilize an offshore rig from one market to another  are recognized over the primary term of the related drilling contract 
revenues from reimbursements received for the purchase of supplies  equipment  personnel services and other services provided at the request of the customer in accordance with a contract or agreement are recorded for the gross amount billed to the customer  as revenues related to reimbursable expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 
revenues from offshore turnkey drilling contracts are accrued to the extent of costs until the specified turnkey depth and other contract requirements are met 
income is recognized on the completed contract method 
provisions for future losses on turnkey contracts are recognized when it becomes apparent that expenses to be incurred on a specific contract will exceed the revenue from that contract 
the company has elected not to pursue contracts for integrated services  which includes turnkey contracts  except in very limited circumstances 
operating income 
operating income is primarily affected by revenue factors  but is also a function of varying levels of operating expenses 
operating expenses generally are not affected by changes in dayrates and may not be significantly affected by fluctuations in utilization 
for instance  if a rig is to be idle for a short period of time  few decreases in operating expenses may actually occur since the rig is typically maintained in a prepared or ready stacked state with a full crew 
in addition  when a rig is idle  the company is responsible for certain operating expenses such as rig fuel and supply boat costs  which are typically costs of the operator when a rig is under contract 
however  if the rig is to be idle for an extended period of time  the company may reduce the size of a rig s crew and take steps to cold stack the rig  which lowers expenses and partially offsets the impact on operating income 
the company recognizes as operating expenses activities such as inspections  painting projects and routine overhauls  which meet certain criteria  that maintain rather than upgrade its rigs 
these expenses vary from period to period 
costs of rig enhancements are capitalized and depreciated over the expected useful lives of the enhancements 
higher depreciation expense decreases operating income in periods subsequent to capital upgrades 
operating income is negatively impacted when the company performs certain regulatory inspections that are due every five years year survey for all of the company s rigs 
operating revenue decreases because these surveys are performed during scheduled down time in a shipyard 
operating expenses increase as a result of these surveys due to the cost to mobilize the rigs to a shipyard  inspection costs incurred and repair and maintenance costs 
repair and maintenance costs may be required resulting from the survey or may have been previously planned to take place during this mandatory down time 
the number of rigs undergoing a year survey will vary from year to year 
critical accounting estimates the company s significant accounting policies are included in note of its notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
management s judgments  assumptions and estimates are inherent in the preparation of the company s financial statements and the application of its significant accounting policies 
the company believes that its most critical accounting estimates are as follows property  plant and equipment 
drilling and other property and equipment is carried at cost 
maintenance and routine repairs are charged to income currently while replacements and betterments  which meet certain criteria  are capitalized 
depreciation is amortized up to applicable salvage values by applying the straight line method over the remaining estimated useful lives 
in april the company commissioned a study to evaluate the economic lives of its drilling rigs 
as a result of this study  effective april   the company recorded changes in accounting estimates by increasing the estimated service lives to years for jack ups and years for semisubmersibles and the company s drillship and by increasing salvage values to for most of the company s drilling rigs 
the change in estimate was made to better reflect the remaining economic lives and salvage values of the company s fleet 
the effect of this change in accounting estimate resulted in an increase to net income after tax for the year ended december  of million  or per share 
management makes judgments  assumptions and estimates regarding capitalization  useful lives and salvage values 
changes in these assumptions could produce results that differ from those reported 
the company evaluates its property and equipment for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in september the company wrote down two of its second generation semisubmersible drilling rigs  the ocean century and the ocean prospector  by million to their fair market values subsequent to a decision to offer the rigs for sale 
these rigs were sold in december for  each pre tax 
management s assumptions are an inherent part of an asset impairment evaluation and the use of different assumptions could produce results that differ from those reported 
personal injury claims 
the company s retention of liability for personal injury claims  which primarily result from jones act liability in the gulf of mexico  is million per claim with an additional aggregate annual deductible of million 
the company estimates its liability for personal injury claims based on the existing facts and circumstances in conjunction with historical experience regarding past personal injury claims 
eventual settlement or adjudication of these claims could differ significantly from the estimated amounts 
income taxes 
the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for income taxes  which requires the recognition of the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year  and an asset and liability approach in recognizing the amount of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been currently recognized in its financial statements or tax returns 
the application of this accounting standard requires that management make judgments regarding future events and related estimations especially as they pertain to forecasting of the company s effective tax rate  the potential realization of deferred tax assets such as utilization of foreign tax credits  and exposure to the disallowance of items deducted on tax returns upon audit 
in a valuation allowance of million  which resulted in a charge against earnings  was established for certain of the company s foreign tax credit carryforwards which will begin to expire in although the company intends to make use of all available tax planning strategies in order to be able to utilize these carryforwards  under the more likely than not approach of evaluating the associated deferred tax asset the company deemed that a valuation allowance was necessary 
years ended december  and comparative data relating to the company s revenues and operating expenses by equipment type are listed below eliminations offset i dayrate revenues earned when the company s rigs are utilized in its integrated services and ii intercompany expenses charged to rig operations 
certain amounts applicable to the prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the classifications currently followed

revenues 
revenues from high specification floaters decreased million during the year ended december   compared to the same period in lower average operating dayrates for most of the rigs in this classification resulted in a million reduction in revenue 
average operating dayrates fell from  during to  excluding the ocean rover during significant reductions in average operating dayrates were experienced by certain rigs located in southeast asia the ocean baroness  to  us gulf of mexico the ocean valiant  to  and the ocean victory  to 
an overall improvement in utilization for high specification floaters during contributed million to revenues and partially offset the negative effect of lower average operating dayrates 
utilization improved to for the year ended december  from for the same period in excluding the ocean rover 
utilization improved for the ocean america  which worked most of but was stacked for almost half of  the ocean baroness  which worked most of but spent most of the first quarter of in a shipyard completing its upgrade to high specification capabilities  and the ocean star  which worked all of but was stacked four months during the same period in partially offsetting the overall improvement in utilization was a decline in utilization for the ocean valiant  which was stacked in for approximately three more months than in the unfavorable revenue variance for high specification rigs in compared to was also partially offset by million in revenue contributed by the ocean rover  which began its drilling program offshore malaysia in july upon completion of its upgrade to high specification capabilities 
the rig spent all of undergoing its upgrade 
contract drilling expense 
contract drilling expense for high specification floaters for the year ended december  increased million compared to the same period in higher contract drilling expenses were primarily due to operating costs for the ocean baroness  which worked most of the current year compared to when the rig began operations late in the first quarter upon completion of its upgrade  operating costs associated with the ocean rover  which began operating in july compared to  when most of this rig s costs were capitalized in connection with its upgrade  and mobilization  year survey and repair costs incurred by the ocean valiant during these higher contract drilling expenses were partially offset by lower expenses in compared to primarily due to higher costs incurred during for the recovery of the ocean baroness s marine riser  net of costs charged to an associated insurance claim  and year survey and repair costs for the ocean victory and the ocean star incurred during other semisubmersibles 
revenues 
revenues from other semisubmersibles for the year ended december  were million lower compared to the same period in a decline in the average operating dayrate excluding the ocean patriot and the ocean vanguard  from  during to  during  resulted in lower revenues of million 
the most significant decreases in average operating dayrates were to certain rigs located in the north sea the ocean guardian  to  the ocean princess  to  the ocean nomad  to  and southeast asia the ocean general  to 
lower utilization of excluding the ocean patriot and the ocean vanguard during compared to during resulted in a million revenue decrease 
utilization declined primarily due to the ocean epoch  which was stacked the majority of but worked most of  the ocean guardian and the ocean yorktown  which were each stacked approximately three months during compared to when both rigs worked most of the year  and the ocean liberator  which was cold stacked all of but worked approximately three months during partially offsetting the decline in revenue in compared to were improvements in revenue from the ocean worker which worked most of but spent approximately three months in in a shipyard for its year survey and repairs  and million contributed by the ocean vanguard and the ocean patriot  which the company acquired in december and march  respectively 
contract drilling expense 
contract drilling expense for other semisubmersibles during the year ended december  was higher by million compared to the same period in primarily due to additional costs during associated with the ocean vanguard and the ocean patriot  which the company acquired in december and march  respectively  the mobilization of the ocean worker  ocean ambassador  ocean yorktown and the ocean whittington to mexico in  the inspection of the ocean guardian  and the year surveys of the ocean ambassador  ocean nomad and the ocean bounty during partially offsetting the higher contract drilling expenses during were lower expenses from the ocean liberator  ocean new era  ocean voyager and the ocean endeavor which were cold stacked all of but were ready stacked during most or part of jack ups 
revenues 
revenues from jack ups decreased million during the year ended december   compared to the same period in utilization fell to during from during  resulting in a million reduction in revenue 
the decline in utilization was primarily from the ocean sovereign  which spent most of in a shipyard completing its leg extension upgrade but operated offshore indonesia all of  and the ocean titan  which was in a gulf of mexico shipyard from may through december for a cantilever conversion but worked almost all of the same period in the lower overall revenue in was partially offset by a million increase in revenue due to utilization improvements from the ocean spartan  ocean spur and the ocean heritage  which operated most of but were undergoing leg extension upgrades during  and the ocean crusader  which worked almost all of but was stacked approximately three months in also offsetting the unfavorable revenue variance for jack up rigs was an overall improvement in the average operating dayrate  from  during to  during  which increased revenue by million in contract drilling expense 
contract drilling expense for jack ups during increased million from primarily due to operating costs incurred in for the ocean spartan  ocean spur  ocean tower and the ocean heritage compared to costs that were capitalized in connection with their leg extension upgrades  and costs associated with the year surveys of the ocean drake and ocean warwick in partially offsetting the higher contract drilling expenses were reduced costs for the ocean champion  which was cold stacked all of but only part of  and reduced costs for the ocean titan due to the capitalization of most costs during its cantilever upgrade  which began in the second quarter of and continued through its completion in january integrated services 
integrated services had an operating loss of million in comprised of project income of million from the completion of one turnkey plug and abandonment project in the gulf of mexico during the first quarter of that was more than offset by operating overhead costs 
during  an operating loss of million resulted primarily from an unprofitable turnkey project in the gulf of mexico 
the company has elected not to pursue contracts for integrated services except in very limited circumstances 
other 
other operating expense of  for the year ended december   decreased million compared to operating income of million for the year ended december  for the year ended december  other operating expense of million was primarily due to the write off of a contract dispute with a customer and a reserve for pending litigation 
these operating expenses in were partially offset by operating income of million primarily from the reimbursement of foreign taxes paid by the company s customers on its behalf  settlements with the company s customers related to prior years disputes and the reversal of a reserve related to a prior year customer contract audit 
other operating income of million for the year ended december   resulted primarily from a million reimbursement of prior year foreign income tax to be received by the company from its customers and related to a tax settlement made between the company and the norwegian tax authorities in december the corresponding income tax expense is reflected in income tax benefit expense in the company s consolidated statement of operations 
other operating income in also included a million reversal of an accrual made in a prior year for personal injury claims and the elimination of a million reserve for inventory obsolescence  from prior years  that was deemed no longer necessary 
reimbursable expenses  net 
reimbursable expenses include items that the company purchases  and or services it performs  at the request of its customers 
revenues related to reimbursable items  offset by the related expenditures for these items  were million in compared to million in depreciation 
depreciation expense for the year ended december   decreased million to million compared to million in a million pre tax reduction in depreciation expense resulted from increasing the estimated service lives and salvage values of most of the company s drilling rigs  effective april   to better reflect their remaining economic lives and salvage values 
this decrease was partially offset by additional depreciation from the ocean vanguard and the ocean patriot  which the company acquired in december and march  respectively 
depreciation also increased due to additional depreciation for five of the company s recently upgraded jack up rigs  additional depreciation for the ocean rover  which completed its upgrade in july and additional depreciation for the ocean baroness  which completed its upgrade in march loss gain on sale and disposition of assets 
a loss on the sale and disposition of assets of million occurred during primarily due to the sale of two of the company s second generation semisubmersible drilling rigs  the ocean century and ocean prospector 
these rigs  which had been cold stacked since july and october  respectively  were permanently retired from service as offshore drilling rigs and written down by million to their fair market values in september and subsequently sold for  each pre tax in december a gain on the sale of assets of approximately  occurred in interest income 
interest income of million earned in declined million  from million earned in these earnings were lower primarily due to lower interest rates earned on cash and marketable securities compared to and less cash investment during loss gain on sale of marketable securities 
a loss on the sale of marketable securities of million occurred in compared to a million gain on the sale of marketable securities in see note marketable securities in item of this report 
other income and expense other  net 
other income of million for the year ended december  increased million from other income of million for the same period in other income for both years ended december  and was primarily from a pre tax gain on foreign exchange forward contracts of million and million  respectively 
see note derivative financial instruments forward exchange contracts to the company s consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
income tax benefit expense 
an income tax benefit of million was recognized on a pre tax loss of million for the year ended december   compared to tax expense of million recognized on pre tax income of million in in the company formed a cayman island corporation  diamond offshore international limited  which is a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
certain of the company s rigs that operate internationally are now owned and operated  directly or indirectly  by diamond offshore international limited 
effective january   the company began to postpone remittance of the earnings from this subsidiary to the us and to indefinitely reinvest these earnings internationally 
consequently  no us taxes were provided on these earnings and no us tax benefits were recognized on losses during in a valuation allowance of million  which resulted in a charge against earnings  was established for certain of the company s foreign tax credit carryforwards which will begin to expire in although the company intends to make use of all available tax planning strategies in order to be able to utilize these carryforwards  under the more likely than not approach of evaluating the associated deferred tax asset the company deemed that a valuation allowance was necessary 
in addition  in the company reduced its deferred tax liability by million related to the deductibility of goodwill associated with a acquisition 
in the first quarter of  a portion of the earnings from the company s uk subsidiaries was considered to be indefinitely reinvested and no uk taxes were provided on those earnings 
the effect of the indefinite reinvestment of the uk earnings in was to lower the annual effective tax rate but this decline was more than offset by prior year foreign tax expense recorded in  primarily million for a norwegian income tax settlement 
see other 
these uk subsidiaries are now owned  directly or indirectly  by diamond offshore international limited 
consequently  earnings and losses from the uk subsidiaries for are part of the earnings and losses of the cayman island subsidiary on which no us taxes are provided

revenues 
despite the rise in oil and natural gas prices that began in late and continued throughout  improvements in dayrates and utilization for the company s equipment did not materialize 
as a result  revenues from high specification floaters decreased million during the year ended december  from the same period in revenue generated from the operation of the ocean baroness in of million partially offset revenue shortfalls caused by lower average dayrates and utilization for this fleet during the year ended the ocean baroness began operations in mid march after completing an upgrade to high specification capabilities 
the rig was in a singapore shipyard undergoing its upgrade throughout excluding the ocean baroness  average operating dayrates dropped from  per day during to  per day during resulting in a million revenue decline 
significant declines to average operating dayrates were experienced by the following rigs all located in the us gulf of mexico the ocean valiant  to  the ocean victory  to  the ocean america  to  and the ocean star  to 
utilization declined from in to in resulting in a million decrease in revenue excluding the ocean baroness 
significant utilization reductions resulted from the ocean america  which was idle for approximately five months during but worked most of  the ocean star  which spent three and one half months during in a shipyard for its year survey and repairs but worked all of  and the ocean victory which spent two months during in a shipyard for its year survey and repairs but worked all of contract drilling expense 
contract drilling expense for high specification floaters during the year ended december  increased million from the same period in higher contract drilling expenses were primarily due to operating expenses for the ocean baroness of million for which included costs incurred in connection with the recovery of its marine riser  net of insurance recoveries  as well as its normal operating costs  year surveys and repairs of the ocean star  ocean victory  and the ocean quest in which increased expenses by million  higher brazilian customs fees in of million for the importation of spare parts and supplies for the ocean alliance and the ocean clipper  approximately million for repairs to the ocean america including boat and fuel costs while the rig was idle during  and higher comparative costs in for the ocean clipper resulted from a million reduction in an insurance deductible  which lowered overall operating costs in other semisubmersibles 
revenues 
revenues from other semisubmersibles decreased million from the year ended december  compared to the same period of lower utilization accounted for million of the decrease  dropping to for the year ended december  from for the same period in significant declines in utilization were experienced by the ocean voyager and the ocean endeavor both of which have been cold stacked since march but worked the majority of  the ocean new era which was idle or cold stacked all of but worked almost half of  the ocean worker which was in a shipyard for a year survey and repairs during part of but worked most of  and the ocean saratoga which was in a shipyard for its year survey during part of but worked most of partially offsetting the negative impact of these declines in utilization was an improvement in utilization for the ocean bounty  which operated most of compared to when the rig was stacked for approximately two months 
lower overall average dayrates caused million of the unfavorable variance in other semisubmersibles revenue 
however  the average operating dayrate for this fleet increased to  during the year ended december  from  during the same period of this occurred because several of the rigs that were contracted at lower dayrates in were stacked throughout parts of consequently  the average operating dayrate rose in for the working rigs in this class 
rigs in this fleet with significant changes to average operating dayrates were experienced by certain rigs located in the us gulf of mexico the ocean worker  to  africa the ocean whittington  which operated in brazil during  to north sea the ocean guardian  to  and the ocean princess  to 
contract drilling expense 
contract drilling expense for other semisubmersibles was million lower in than in primarily due to cost savings of million in from the ocean endeavor and the ocean voyager  both of which have been cold stacked since march  a million reduction in costs resulting from the ocean new era and the ocean ambassador which were stacked with reduced crews for most of  and contract drilling expenses lower by million in for the ocean whittington compared to expenses which included a year survey  repairs and preparation for its mobilization from the us gulf of mexico to namibia in december partially offsetting the overall lower contract drilling expenses in were higher operating costs million for the ocean nomad compared to operating costs which were lower because this rig was in a shipyard being upgraded  additional expenses million in due to a year survey and repairs to the ocean worker  and additional expenses million in from higher brazilian customs fees for the importation of spare parts and supplies for the ocean yatzy  ocean yorktown and the ocean winner 
jack ups 
revenues 
revenues from jack ups during the year ended december  decreased million from the same period of a reduction in the average operating dayrate from  in to  in  contributed million to the overall revenue decline 
all of the gulf of mexico jack up rigs experienced lower average operating dayrates in only the ocean heritage  a rig which operated offshore indonesia and australia  experienced a significant improvement in its dayrate  from  in to  in revenues decreased million from a decline in utilization from in to in primarily due to the ocean champion  which was idle and or cold stacked throughout  but worked most of  and the ocean spartan  ocean spur  ocean tower and the ocean heritage all of which spent time in shipyards undergoing upgrades during but worked most of the unfavorable utilization variance in was partially offset by higher revenue for the ocean sovereign which worked all of but spent most of in a shipyard for repairs 
contract drilling expense 
contract drilling expense for jack ups decreased million in compared to significant reductions in expenses were as follows million for the ocean spartan  ocean spur  ocean tower and the ocean heritage resulting from reduced operating costs while these rigs were in shipyards undergoing upgrades  million for the ocean champion which was idle and or cold stacked during all of but worked most of  and lower comparative costs in for the ocean nugget  ocean crusader  and the ocean summit due to repairs that contributed to higher contract drilling expenses during the first half of partially offsetting the lower contract drilling expenses in were higher costs from the mobilization of the ocean heritage from indonesia to australia and higher labor costs in australia 
integrated services 
operating income for integrated services decreased million during the year ended december  compared to the same period of resulting from the difference in type and magnitude of projects during those periods 
during  an operating loss of million resulted primarily from an unprofitable turnkey project in the gulf of mexico 
during the same period in  operating income of million was primarily due to the completion of one international turnkey project and three turnkey permanent plug and abandonment projects in the gulf of mexico 
other 
other operating income of million for the year ended december  increased million from the same period in the increase resulted primarily from a million reimbursement of prior year foreign income tax to be received by the company from its customers and relates to a tax settlement made between the company and the norwegian tax authorities in december the corresponding income tax expense is reflected in income tax benefit expense in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
also contributing to the higher other operating income in was a million reversal of an accrual made in a prior year for personal injury claims and the elimination of a million reserve for inventory obsolescence  from prior years  that was deemed no longer necessary 
reimbursables  net 
revenues related to reimbursable items that the company purchases and or services it performs at the request of its customers offset by the related expenditures for these items were million in compared to million in depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended december  increased million over the same period of higher depreciation resulted primarily from depreciation for capital additions and additional depreciation for the ocean baroness  which completed its deepwater upgrade and began operations in march the suspension of goodwill amortization on january  partially offset this increase 
goodwill amortization during the year ended december  was million 
see note goodwill and note to the company s consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense was million higher in than in the comparable period in primarily due to higher personnel costs and professional expenses  including legal fees  tax and accounting fees and security consulting 
interest income 
interest income of million for the year ended december  decreased million from million for the same period in primarily due to a reduction in marketable securities held and lower interest rates earned on cash and marketable securities in compared to interest expense 
interest expense of million for the year ended december  was million lower than in the same period of primarily due to an million pre tax charge that resulted from the april redemption of the company s convertible subordinated notes due notes 
in addition  the company s weighted average interest rate in was lower than in resulting from the redemption in of the notes and the issuance of the convertible senior debentures due the debentures on april  interest expense was also lower in than in due to more interest capitalized to rig upgrades in interest capitalized to rig upgrades was million in compared to million in in interest was capitalized to the ocean baroness during the final three months of its upgrade and during the entire year for the ocean rover

see note derivative financial instruments forward exchange contracts to the company s consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
other expense in included a million reserve established for a class action lawsuit which was ultimately settled in june and was partially offset by a million receipt for the settlement of an unrelated lawsuit 
income tax expense 
income tax expense of million for the year ended december  decreased million from million for the same period in primarily as a result of a million decrease in income before income tax expense in the annual effective tax rate increased from in to in in the company made the decision to indefinitely reinvest part of the earnings of its uk subsidiaries and the annual effective rate for the year reflects this decision 
the effect of the indefinite reinvestment of the uk earnings in was to lower the annual effective tax rate but this decline was more than offset by prior year foreign tax expense recorded in  primarily million for a norwegian income tax settlement

the company s measure of market risk exposure represents an estimate of the change in fair value of its financial instruments 
market risk exposure is presented for each class of financial instrument held by the company at december  and december   assuming immediate adverse market movements of the magnitude described below 
the company believes that the various rates of adverse market movements represent a measure of exposure to loss under hypothetically assumed adverse conditions 
the estimated market risk exposure represents the hypothetical loss to future earnings and does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected actual loss  even under adverse conditions  because actual adverse fluctuations would likely differ 
in addition  since the company s investment portfolio is subject to change based on its portfolio management strategy as well as in response to changes in the market  these estimates are not necessarily indicative of the actual results which may occur 
exposure to market risk is managed and monitored by senior management 
senior management approves the overall investment strategy employed by the company and has responsibility to ensure that the investment positions are consistent with that strategy and the level of risk acceptable to it 
the company may manage risk by buying or selling instruments or entering into offsetting positions 
interest rate risk the company has exposure to interest rate risk arising from changes in the level or volatility of interest rates 
the company s investments in marketable securities are primarily in fixed maturity securities 
the company monitors its sensitivity to interest rate risk by evaluating the change in the value of its financial assets and liabilities due to fluctuations in interest rates 
the evaluation is performed by applying an instantaneous change in interest rates by varying magnitudes on a static balance sheet to determine the effect such a change in rates would have on the recorded market value of the company s investments and the resulting effect on stockholders equity 
the analysis presents the sensitivity of the market value of the company s financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices which the company believes are reasonably possible over a one year period 
the sensitivity analysis estimates the change in the market value of the company s interest sensitive assets and liabilities that were held on december  and december   due to instantaneous parallel shifts in the yield curve of basis points  with all other variables held constant 
the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
accordingly  the analysis may not be indicative of  is not intended to provide  and does not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on the company s earnings or stockholders equity 
further  the computations do not contemplate any actions the company could undertake in response to changes in interest rates 
the company s long term debt  as of december  and december  is denominated in us dollars 
the company s debt has been primarily issued at fixed rates  and as such  interest expense would not be impacted by interest rate shifts 
the impact of a basis point increase in interest rates on fixed rate debt would result in a decrease in market value of million and million  respectively 
a basis point decrease would result in an increase in market value of million and million  respectively 
foreign exchange risk foreign exchange rate risk arises from the possibility that changes in foreign currency exchange rates will impact the value of financial instruments 
in mid the company had contracted to purchase approximately million australian dollars  million australian dollars to be purchased monthly from august  through june   and million australian dollars to be purchased on july  these foreign exchange forward contracts are recorded at their fair value determined by discounting future cash flows at current forward rates 
as of december   the company had satisfied all obligations under these contracts and has not entered into any new forward exchange contracts 
at december   an asset of million reflecting the fair value of the forward contracts was included with prepaid expenses and other in the consolidated balance sheet 
the sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous change in the foreign currency exchange rates versus the us dollar from their levels at december   with all other variables held constant 
the following table presents the company s market risk by category interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates fair value asset liability market risk december  december  in thousands category of risk exposure interest rate marketable securities  a  a c  c long term debt  b  b foreign exchange  d a the fair market value of the company s investment in marketable securities is based on the quoted closing market prices on december  and december  b the fair values of the company s debentures due and zero coupon convertible debentures due are based on the quoted closing market prices on december  and december  the fair value of the company s ocean alliance lease leaseback agreement is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows using a discount rate of for december  and for december  c the calculation of estimated market risk exposure is based on assumed adverse changes in the underlying reference price or index of an increase in interest rates of basis points at december  and december  d the calculation of estimated market risk exposure is based on assumed adverse changes in the underlying reference price or index of a decrease in foreign exchange rates of at december
