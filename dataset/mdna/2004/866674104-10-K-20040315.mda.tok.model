item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto elsewhere herein 
the company is a fully integrated  self administered and self managed reit which owns  operates  develops and finances manufactured housing communities concentrated in the midwestern and southeastern united states 
as of december   the company owned and operated a portfolio of developed properties located in seventeen states  including manufactured housing communities  five recreational vehicle communities  and seven properties containing both manufactured housing and recreational vehicle sites 
during  the company acquired one manufactured housing community located in east lansing  michigan  comprising developed sites and sites suitable for development for million  and the company sold four manufactured housing communities located in michigan and illinois which comprised sites for million 
the company has been experiencing increased vacancies due primarily to the glut of repossessed homes caused by lax credit standards in the mid to late s 
as lenders recognize their problems and repossess homes  the company s vacancies rise 
industry estimates are that such conditions are abating and the number of repossessed homes in will approximate  roughly one half of the number in recent years 
this abatement should have positive effects on new home sales which fill sites in the company s communities 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
in preparing these financial statements  management has made its best estimates and judgment of certain amounts included in the financial statements 
nevertheless  actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following significant accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements impairment of long lived assets 
rental property is recorded at cost  less accumulated depreciation 
management evaluates the recoverability of its investment in rental property whenever events or changes in circumstances  such as recent operating results  expected net operating cash flow and plans for future operations  indicate that full asset recoverability is questionable 
if such assets were deemed to be impaired as a result of this measurement  the impairment that would be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset as determined on a discounted net cash flow basis 
notes receivable 
the company evaluates the recoverability of its notes receivable whenever events occur or there are changes in circumstances such that management believes it is probable that it will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
the loan is then measured based on the present value of the expected future cash flow discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
depreciation 
depreciation is computed on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
the company uses a thirty year useful life for land improvements and buildings and a seven to fifteen year useful life for furniture  fixtures and equipment 
revenue recognition 
rental income attributable to leases is recorded on a straight line basis when earned from tenants 
leases entered into by tenants generally range from month to month to one year and are renewable by mutual agreement of the company and the resident 
capitalized costs 
the company capitalizes certain costs including interest and other costs incurred in connection with the development  redevelopment  capital enhancement and leasing of its properties 
management is required to use professional judgment in determining whether such costs meet the criteria for immediate expense or capitalization 
the amounts are dependent on the volume and timing of such activities and the costs associated with such activities 
maintenance  repairs and minor improvements to properties are expensed when incurred 
renovations and improvements to properties are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives and construction costs related to the development of new community or expansion sites are capitalized until the property is substantially complete 
certain expenditures to dealers and residents related to obtaining lessees in our communities are capitalized and amortized over a seven year period  shorter than the average resident s occupancy in the home and the average term that the home is in our community 
costs associated with implementing the company s new computer systems are capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful lives of the related software and hardware 
derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the company has entered into three interest rate swap agreements to offset interest rate risk 
the company does not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes 
the company adjusts its balance sheet on an ongoing quarterly basis to reflect current fair market value of its derivatives 
changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in earnings or comprehensive income  as appropriate 
the ineffective portion of the hedge is immediately recognized in earnings to the extent that the change in value of a derivative does not perfectly offset the change in value of the instrument being hedged 
the unrealized gains and losses held in accumulated other comprehensive income will be reclassified to earnings over time and occurs when the hedged items are also recognized in earnings 
the company uses standard market conventions to determine the fair values of derivative instruments  including the quoted market prices or quotes from brokers or dealers for the same or similar instruments 
all methods of assessing fair value result in a general approximation of value and such value may never actually be realized 
deferred tax assets 
shs currently has significant deferred tax assets  which are subject to periodic recoverability assessments 
shs has recognized deferred tax assets of million  net of a valuation reserve of million 
realization of these deferred tax assets is principally dependent upon shs s achievement of expected future taxable income 
judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions  shs s ability to continue to successfully execute its business plan  and other factors 
income taxes 
the company has elected to be taxed as a reit as defined under section c of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
in order for the company to qualify as a reit  at least ninety five percent of the company s gross income in any year must be derived from qualifying sources 
as a reit  the company generally will not be subject to us federal income taxes at the corporate level if it distributes at least ninety percent of its reit ordinary taxable income to its stockholders  which it fully intends to do 
if the company fails to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  the company will be subject to federal income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on its taxable income at regular corporate rates 
the company remains subject to certain state and local taxes on its income and property as well as federal income and excise taxes on its undistributed income

these increases were partially offset by million of income related primarily to the change in market value of an interest rate swap contract that does not qualify for hedge accounting 
equity income from affiliates of million represents the company s one third interest in the operations of origen for its initial operating period after a recapitalization in october  the remaining expense increase of million relates to the consolidation of sun home services which is discussed in detail below 
sun home services prior to january   the results of operations of sun home services were accounted for using the equity method and reported as a single line item called equity in income from affiliates 
as the company is the primary beneficiary of the results of operations of sun home services  it is appropriate to consolidate sun home services at december  this has no effect on previously reported net income 
the following table summarizes certain financial and statistical data for sun home services for the years ended december  and increase decrease percent change pro forma new home sales revenues    cost of sales    gross profit    pre owned home sales revenues    cost of sales    gross profit  ancillary revenue  net    home sales volumes new homes pre owned homes new home sales declined by percent  while revenues and costs of sales declined by and percent  respectively

same property information the following table reflects property level financial information as of and for the years ended december  and the same property data represents information regarding the operation of communities owned as of january  and december  site  occupancy  and rent data for those communities is presented as of the last day of each period presented 
the total portfolio column differentiates from the same property column by including financial information for properties acquired after january  and new development communities

investors in and analysts following the real estate industry utilize net operating income noi as a supplemental performance measure 
the company considers noi  given its wide use by and relevance to investors and analysts  an appropriate supplemental measure to net income because noi provides a measure of rental operations and does not factor in depreciation amortization and non property specific expenses such as general and administrative expenses 
same property information does not include properties sold during the year ended december  on a same property basis  property net operating income increased by million from million to million  or percent 
income from property increased by million from million to million  or percent  due primarily to increases in rents including water and property tax pass through

liquidity and capital resources the company s principal liquidity demands have historically been  and are expected to continue to be  distributions to the company s stockholders and the operating partnership s unitholders  property acquisitions  development and expansion of properties  capital improvements of properties and debt repayment 
the company expects to meet its short term liquidity requirements through its working capital provided by operating activities and its line of credit  as described below 
the company considers its ability to generate cash from operations anticipated to be approximately million to be adequate to meet all operating requirements  including recurring capital improvements  routinely amortizing debt and other normally recurring expenditures of a capital nature  pay dividends to its stockholders to maintain qualification as a reit in accordance with the internal revenue code and make distributions to the operating partnership s unitholders 
the company plans to invest approximately million in developments consisting of expansions to existing communities and the continuing development of new communities 
the company expects to finance these investments by using net cash flows provided by operating activities and by drawing upon its line of credit 
furthermore  the company expects to invest in the range of to million in the acquisition of individual properties in  depending upon market conditions 
the company plans to finance these investments by using net cash flows provided by operating activities and by drawing upon its line of credit 
cash and cash equivalents increased by million to million at december  compared to million at december  due to the net proceeds received from the sale of four properties 
net cash provided by operating activities increased by million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase resulted primarily from increased net income  higher depreciation  the effect of consolidating shs  and changes in other miscellaneous asset and liabilities accounts 
the company s net cash flows provided by operating activities may be adversely impacted by  among other things a the market and economic conditions in the company s markets  b lower occupancy rates of the properties  c increased operating costs  including insurance premiums  real estate taxes and utilities  that cannot be passed on to the company s tenants  and d decreased sales of manufactured homes 
see factors that may affect future results 
in october  the company acquired a community in east lansing  mi and financed the acquisition with a mortgage for million and the remainder in cash 
the company entered into a million loan facility in september of  of which million was available to be borrowed at december  borrowings bear an interest rate of federal funds effective rate plus 
and mature on march  in april the company issued million of percent senior notes  due april   and used the proceeds from the offering to retire the bridge loan of million and senior notes of million which matured on april and may   respectively 
the remaining proceeds paid down the company s line of credit 
the company has a million unsecured line of credit facility  which matures in july  with a one year optional extension 
at december   the average interest rate of outstanding borrowings under the line of credit was  million was outstanding and million was available to be drawn under the facility 
the line of credit facility contains various leverage  debt service coverage  net worth maintenance and other customary covenants all of which the company was in compliance with at december  the company s primary long term liquidity needs are principal payments on outstanding indebtedness 
at december   the company s outstanding contractual obligations were as follows payments due by period in thousands contractual cash obligations total due year years years after years line of credit   collateralized term loan    collateralized term loan fnma   senior notes     mortgage notes  other      capitalized lease obligations   redeemable preferred op units     the provisions of the callable redeemable million notes are such that the maturity date will likely be if the year treasury rate is greater than on may  the maturity is reflected in the above table based on that assumption 
the company anticipates meeting its long term liquidity requirements  such as scheduled debt maturities  large property acquisitions and operating partnership unit redemptions  through the issuance of debt or equity securities  including equity units in the operating partnership  or from selective asset sales 
since  the company has raised  in the aggregate  nearly billion from the sale of shares of its common stock  from the sale of op units in the operating partnership  and the issuance of secured and unsecured debt securities 
in addition  at december   of the properties were unencumbered by debt  therefore  providing substantial financial flexibility 
the ability of the company to finance its long term liquidity requirements in such manner will be affected by numerous economic factors affecting the manufactured housing community industry at the time  including the availability and cost of mortgage debt  the financial condition of the company  the operating history of the properties  the state of the debt and equity markets  and the general national  regional and local economic conditions 
see factors that may affect future results 
if the company is unable to obtain additional equity or debt financing on acceptable terms  the company s business  results of operations and financial condition will be harmed 
included in debt are million of preferred op units which would require collateralization were the company to no longer be classified as investment grade by the rating agencies 
at december   the company s debt to total market capitalization approximated percent assuming conversion of all common op units to shares of common stock 
the debt has a weighted average maturity of approximately years and a weighted average interest rate of percent 
capital expenditures for the years ended december  and included recurring capital expenditures of million excluding million related to a main office relocation and million related to a software conversion and million  respectively 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million in the prior year 
the differences are due to decreased investment in rental properties of million  increased proceeds from property disposition of million  increased repayments of notes receivables of million  and decreased investment in and advances to affiliates of million 
included in proceeds from property dispositions is million of proceeds deposited with an intermediary for section exchange purposes 
these sales proceeds will be disbursed as the company exchanges properties under section of the internal revenue code 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million in the prior year 
the differences were primarily due to changes in net proceeds from notes payable  inclusive of borrowings on line of credit  of million  increased distributions of million  offset by changes in net proceeds from common stock issuance of million and changes in payments of deferred financing costs of million 
ratio of earnings to fixed charges the company s ratio of earnings to fixed charges for the years ended december    and was  and respectively 
inflation most of the leases allow for periodic rent increases which provide the company with the opportunity to achieve increases in rental income as each lease expires 
such types of leases generally minimize the risk of inflation to the company

recent accounting pronouncements in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity which establishes standards for how financial instruments that have characteristics of both liabilities and equity instruments should be classified on the balance sheet 
the requirements of sfas generally outline that financial instruments that give the issuer a choice of settling an obligation with a variable number of securities or settling an obligation with a transfer of assets or any mandatorily redeemable security should be classified as a liability on the balance sheet 
the company has reclassified mandatorily redeemable preferred operating partnership units of million into debt as of december  the reclassification had no effect on the company s compliance with the covenant requirements of its credit agreements 
in april  fasb issued sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the statement amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts collectively referred to as derivatives and for hedging activities under fasb statements no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement is effective for contracts entered into or modified after june  and for hedging relationships designated after june  in addition  all provisions of this statement should be applied prospectively 
the provisions of this statement that relate to statement implementation issues that have been effective for fiscal quarters that began prior to june   should continue to be applied in accordance with their respective effective dates 
the adoption of this statement did not have a significant impact on the financial position or results of the operations of the company 
in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
the objective of this interpretation is to provide guidance on how to identify a variable interest entity vie and determine when the assets  liabilities  non controlling interests and results of operations of a vie need to be included in a company s consolidated financial statements 
a company that holds variable interests in an entity will need to consolidate the entity if the company s interest in the vie is such that the company will absorb a majority of the vie s expected losses and or receive a majority of the vie s expected residual returns  if they occur 
fin also requires additional disclosures by primary beneficiaries and other significant variable interest holders 
the provisions of this interpretation apply to the end of the first interim period or annual period ending after december  ie  december  to vies in which a company holds a variable interest that it acquired before february  the company has consolidated shs in its financial reporting beginning december  other funds from operations ffo is defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit as net income computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  excluding gains or losses from sales of property  plus rental property depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
industry analysts consider ffo to be an appropriate supplemental measure of the operating performance of an equity reit primarily because the computation of ffo excludes historical cost depreciation as an expense and thereby facilitates the comparison of reits which have different cost bases in their assets 
historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time  whereas real estate values have instead historically risen or fallen based upon market conditions 
ffo does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by generally accepted accounting principles and is a supplemental measure of performance that does not replace net income as a measure of performance or net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of liquidity 
in addition  ffo is not intended as a measure of a reit s ability to meet debt principal repayments and other cash requirements  nor as a measure of working capital 
the following table reconciles net income to ffo and calculates ffo data for both basic and diluted purposes for the years ended december    in thousands sun communities  inc 
reconciliation of net income to funds from operations amounts in thousands  except for per share op unit amounts net income    adjustments depreciation and amortization    valuation adjustment allocation of sunchamp losses   gain loss on dispositions and impairments  net    income allocated to common minority interests    funds from operations ffo    ffo continuing operations    ffo discontinued operations    weighted average common shares op units outstanding basic    diluted    continuing operations ffo per weighted average common share op unit basic ffo per weighted average common share op unit diluted discontinued operations ffo per weighted average common share op unit basic ffo per weighted average common share op unit diluted total operations ffo per weighted average common share op unit basic ffo per weighted average common share op unit diluted the company entered into three interest rate swaps and an interest rate cap agreement 
the valuation adjustment reflects the theoretical noncash profit and loss were those hedging transactions terminated at the balance sheet date 
as the company has no expectation of terminating the transactions prior to maturity  the net of these noncash valuation adjustments will be zero at the various maturities 
as any imperfection related to hedging correlation in these swaps is reflected currently in cash as interest  the valuation adjustments are excluded from funds from operations 
the valuation adjustment is included in interest expense 
the company acquired the equity interest of another investor in sunchamp in december consideration consisted of a long term note payable at net book value 
although the adjustment for the allocation of the sunchamp losses based on sunchamp as a stand alone entity is not reflected in the accompanying financial statements  management believes that it is appropriate to provide for this adjustment because the company s payment obligations with respect to the note are subordinate in all respects to the return of the members equity including the gross book value of the acquired equity plus a preferred return 
as a result  the losses that are allocated to the company from sunchamp as a stand alone entity under generally accepted accounting principles are effectively reallocated to the note for purposes of calculating funds from operations 
at december   the remaining balance on the sunchamp note is approximately million 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company s principal market risk exposure is interest rate risk 
the company mitigates this risk by maintaining prudent amounts of leverage  minimizing capital costs and interest expense while continuously evaluating all available debt and equity resources and following established risk management policies and procedures  which include the periodic use of derivatives 
the company s primary strategy in entering into derivative contracts is to minimize the variability that changes in interest rates could have on its future cash flows 
the company generally employs derivative instruments that effectively convert a portion of its variable rate debt to fixed rate debt 
the company does not enter into derivative instruments for speculative purposes 
the company has entered into three separate interest rate swap agreements and an interest rate cap agreement 
one of the swap agreements fixes million of variable rate borrowings at percent for the period april through july  another of the swap agreements fixes million of variable rate borrowings at percent for the period april through july and the third swap agreement  which is only effective for so long as day libor is percent or less  fixes million of variable rate borrowings at percent for the period april through july the interest rate cap agreement has a cap rate of percent  a notional amount of million and a termination date of april  each of the company s derivative contracts is based upon day libor 
the company s remaining variable rate debt totals million as of december  which bears interest at various libor or fnma discounted mortgage backed securities dmbs rates 
if libor or dmbs increased or decreased by percent during the years ended december  and  the company believes its interest expense would have increased or decreased by approximately million and million  respectively  based on the million and million average balance outstanding under the company s variable rate debt facilities for the year ended december  and  respectively 
additionally  the company had million and million libor based variable rate mortgage and other notes receivable as of december  and if libor increased or decreased by percent during the years ended december  and  the company believes interest income would have increased or decreased by approximately million and million  respectively  based on the million and million average balance outstanding on all variable rate notes receivable for the year ended december  and  respectively
