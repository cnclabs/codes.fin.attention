item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  notes and tables included throughout this report 
all statements other than statements of historical fact included in this report  including statements in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are  or may be deemed to be  forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the exchange act 
executive overview has been a year of significant opportunities and challenges 
opportunities have been substantial as the company expanded its business presence into new markets and will enter a new state during the company s presence will expand from its current three state region to four as it enters tennessee upon consummation of the pcb bancorp acquisition announced in december the acquisition of pcb bancorp was  as all transactions are evaluated  within the context of fcbc s commitment to its shareholders and the value that this transaction will create in terms of earnings and earnings potential for the company s shareholders 
in addition  the company added market presence and depth with the completed acquisitions of stone capital management  a registered investment advisory firm  in january  as well as the commonwealth bank acquisition in june economy the interest rate environment continues to present a challenge to the company s earnings as net interest margins and asset yields have declined in response to the historically low interest rate environment 
net interest margin is managed  to the extent possible  by securing lower funding cost and passing a portion of the reductions to depositors 
the impact of the current economic cycle and interest rate environment is not anticipated to continue its current trend 
nonetheless  the timing and extent of changes is impacted by many variables and is currently unknown 
however  the federal reserve has indicated its willingness to be patient in removing policy accommodation in setting the federal reserve s current monetary policy 
mortgage industry although the low interest rate environment in fueled unprecedented mortgage origination volume  it also came at a time when mortgage and mortgage backed index rates were very volatile 
the first half of the year was favorable as rates remained relatively stable 
however  the latter half of saw fluctuations in mortgage rates which caused many borrowers to lock  unwind and relock positions or not act at all pending hopes for further rate reductions 
the impact of the rate swings was significant on the volume of rate locks outstanding at year end in comparison to and resulted in increased hedging costs at a time when the value of loans began to decline 
the industry forecast and economic outlook for mortgage originations is substantially lower than as a result  the company is evaluating the operations of the mortgage subsidiary of the bank and preparing for the anticipated reduction in origination volume 
other actions may include reducing the overhead of ufm  curtailing hedging activity and developing more efficient delivery channels and mechanisms 
competitive forces and market expansions the company entered new markets in richmond  virginia and winston salem  north carolina 
the richmond and winston salem markets provide great opportunities for expansion but also include the presence of a great number of competitive forces 
competition throughout the banking industry has grown as companies attempt to hold onto and grow market share as the number and type of participating institutions banks  insurance companies  brokerage houses  etc 
increase 
the richmond branch network is well developed and is known to the community in which it serves  which provides a competitive advantage for serving the customer needs of that market 
the winston salem market is a new market for the company and will be a challenge to the de novo branches established there to develop lasting relationships  expand the loan portfolio and other components of profitability 
the new richmond operations are mature and are producing positive returns  however  projected profitability of the winston salem market is not anticipated until late in the fourth quarter of application of critical accounting policies first community s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and conform to general practices within the banking industry 
first community s financial position and results of operations are affected by management s application of accounting policies  including judgments made to arrive at the carrying value of assets and liabilities and amounts reported for revenues  expenses and related disclosures 
different assumptions in the application of these policies could result in material changes in first community s consolidated financial position and or consolidated results of operations 
estimates  assumptions  and judgments are necessary principally when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at estimated fair value  when a decline in the value of an asset carried on the financial statements at fair value warrants an impairment write down or valuation reserve to be established  or when an asset or liability needs to be recorded based upon the probability of occurrence of a future event 
carrying assets and liabilities at fair value inherently results in more financial statement volatility 
the fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based either on quoted market prices or are provided by third party sources  when available 
when third party information is not available  valuation adjustments are estimated in good faith by management primarily through the use of internal and external modeling techniques and or appraisal estimates 
first community s accounting policies are fundamental to understanding management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following is a summary of first community s more subjective and complex critical accounting policies 
in addition  the disclosures presented in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and in management s discussion and analysis  provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined 
based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods  assumptions  and estimates underlying those amounts  management has identified the determination of the allowance for loan losses  the valuation of loans held for sale and the valuation of derivative instruments utilized in mortgage banking and hedging activity to be the accounting areas that require the most subjective or complex judgments 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is established and maintained at levels management deems adequate to cover probable losses inherent in the portfolio as of the balance sheet date and is based on management s evaluation of the risks in the loan portfolio and changes in the nature and volume of loan activity 
estimates for loan losses are determined by analyzing historical loan losses  current trends in delinquencies and charge offs  plans for problem loan resolution  the opinions of fcbi s regulators  changes in the size and composition of the loan portfolio and industry information 
also included in management s estimates for loan losses are considerations with respect to the impact of economic events  the outcome of which are uncertain 
these events may include  but are not limited to  a general slowdown in the economy  fluctuations in overall lending rates  political conditions  legislation that may directly or indirectly affect the banking industry and economic conditions affecting specific geographic areas in which first community conducts business 
as more fully described in note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements and in the discussion included in the allowance for loan losses section of this discussion  the company determines the allowance for loan losses by making specific allocations to impaired loans  loans that exhibit inherent weaknesses and loan pools that possess common credit risk factors 
allocations to loan pools are developed giving weight to risk ratings  historical loss trends and management s judgment concerning those trends and other relevant factors 
these factors may include  among others  actual versus estimated losses  regional and national economic conditions  business segment and portfolio concentrations  industry competition and consolidation  and the impact of government regulations 
the foregoing analysis is performed by the company s credit administration department to evaluate the portfolio and calculate an estimated valuation allowance through a quantitative and qualitative analysis that applies risk factors to those identified risk areas 
this risk management evaluation is applied at both the portfolio level and the individual loan level for commercial loans and credit relationships while the level of consumer and residential mortgage loan allowance is determined primarily on a total portfolio level based on a review of historical loss percentages and other qualitative factors including concentrations  industry specific factors and economic conditions 
the commercial and commercial real estate portfolios require more specific analysis of individually significant loans and the borrower s underlying cash flow  business conditions  capacity for debt repayment and the valuation of secondary sources of payment collateral 
this analysis may result in specifically identified weaknesses and corresponding specific impairment allowances 
the use of various estimates and judgments in the company s ongoing evaluation of the required level of allowance can significantly impact the company s results of operations and financial condition and may result in either greater provisions against earnings reducing net income and earnings per share to increase the allowance or reduced provisions increasing net income and earnings per share 
these estimates and judgments are based upon management s current view of portfolio and economic conditions and the application of revised estimates and assumptions 
loans held for sale  derivative instruments and hedging activities ufm provides a distribution outlet for the sale of loans produced by ufm s wholesale and retail operations 
it originates residential mortgage loans through its production offices located in eastern virginia and sells the majority of its loans through pooled commitments to national investors on a servicing released basis 
in addition  ufm acquires loans from a network of wholesale brokers for subsequent resale to these national investors 
ufm originates all loans with the intent to sell 
loans held for sale are stated at the lower of cost or market locom 
the locom analysis on pools of homogeneous loans is applied on a net aggregate basis 
interest income with respect to loans held for sale is accrued on the principal amount outstanding 
locom valuation techniques applicable to loans held for sale are based on estimated market price indications for similar loans 
pricing estimates are established by participating mortgage purchasers and prevailing economic conditions 
the majority of the loans held for sale have established market pricing indications 
the loans held for sale portfolio at december  was million compared to million at december  risks associated with this lending function include interest rate risk  which is mitigated through the utilization of financial instruments commonly referred to as derivatives to assist in offsetting the effect of changing interest rates 
the company accounts for these instruments in accordance with fasb statement no 
 as amended accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activity 
this statement established accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and for hedging activities 
ufm uses forward mortgage contracts and options short position sales and options to manage interest rate risk in the pipeline of uncommitted loans and interest rate lock commitments rlcs from the point of the loan commitment to the subsequent allocation commitment and delivery to outside investors 
as a result of the timing from origination to sale  and the likelihood of changing interest rates  forward commitments and options collectively referred to as hedging instruments or securities are placed with counter parties to attempt to counter the effect of changing interest rates 
the options and forward commitments to sell securities are considered to be derivatives and  as such  are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value 
the changes in fair value of derivatives are reflected in the consolidated statements of income as gain or loss 
the fair value of the rlcs is based on prevailing interest rates and the assumed probability of closing pull through 
the assumption of a given pull through percentage also enters into the determination of the volume of derivative contracts 
pull through assumptions are continually monitored for changes in the interest rate environment and characteristics of the pool of rlcs 
differences between pull through assumptions and actual pull through could result in a mismatch in the volume of security contracts corresponding to rlcs and lead to volatile or reduced profit margins on the loan products ultimately delivered 
as more fully described in note to the financial statements summary of significant accounting policies  under recent accounting developments  the valuation techniques used to measure loan commitments is very likely to change in the near future as a result of a pending proposal by the sec to create conformity within the industry or how to account for rlc s 
the valuation proposed by the sec would result in the recognition of a liability and expense associated with an option written 
this would constitute a significant change from the current practice which results in the recognition of an asset and associated revenue recognition 
the valuation of rlcs is considered critical because of the impact of borrower behavior and the impact that this behavior pattern will have on the pull through ratio during times of significant rate volatility 
customer behavior is modeled by a mathematical tool based upon historical pull through experience  however  substantial volatility can be experienced  as has been the case over the last two quarters  as a result of the general movement in mortgage rates 
as a result daily pull through has varied significantly over this time period 
customer behavior is difficult to model 
however  the mathematical tool utilized by ufm incorporates volatility derived from market data in an attempt to anticipate borrower reaction to market rate movements 
recent acquisitions and branching activity in january  the bank completed the acquisition of stone capital  based in beckley  west virginia 
this acquisition expanded the bank s operations to include a broader range of financial services  including wealth management  asset allocation  financial planning and investment advice 
at december   stone capital had a total market value of assets under management of million 
stone capital was acquired through the issuance of  shares of company common stock  which represents of the total consideration 
in  stone capital exceeded the annual revenue requirement outlined in the acquisition agreement and another  shares were paid to the original shareholders subsequent to december  the balance of the remaining consideration is payable over the next two years in the form of company common stock subject to revenue minimums outlined in the acquisition agreement 
in june  the company acquired commonwealth  a virginia chartered commercial bank for total consideration of approximately million 
the merger was accomplished through the exchange of 
shares of the company s common stock valued at  cash  or a combination of the company s stock and cash equivalent to for each share of commonwealth common stock 
at acquisition  commonwealth had total assets of million  net loans of million and total deposits of million 
as a result of the preliminary purchase price allocation  the million excess of purchase price over the fair market value of the net assets acquired and identified intangibles was recorded as goodwill 
in the second  third and fourth quarters of  the company opened three de novo branches in winston salem  north carolina 
it is anticipated that these branches will not be profitable until market development has proven successful and adequate loan balances and corresponding loan revenues are established to support the added facilities  infrastructure and other operating costs of these branches 
however  based upon loan production indicators and given the current level of demand  it is anticipated that these branches will begin to break even in the latter half of in february  the company also established loan production offices in charlotte and mount airy  north carolina 
these offices are not involved in deposit gathering activities 
however  they will assist in commercial real estate loan origination 
on december   the company announced the signing of a definitive merger agreement pursuant to which the company will acquire pcb bancorp  inc this acquisition will expand first community bank s commercial banking operations into east tennessee  the company s first entry into the tennessee market 
pcb bancorp has five full service branch offices presently in operation and in the process of construction located in johnson city  kingsport and surrounding areas in washington and sullivan counties in east tennessee 
pcb bancorp  which is headquartered in johnson city  tennessee  had total assets of million  total deposits of million and total stockholders equity of million as of december  under the terms of the merger agreement  shares of pcb bancorp common stock will be purchased for per share in cash 
the total deal value  including the cash out of outstanding stock options  is approximately million 
concurrent with the pcb bancorp merger  peoples community bank  the wholly owned subsidiary of pcb bancorp  will be merged into the bank 
the merger is expected to close late in the first quarter of  pending the receipt of all requisite regulatory approvals and the approval of pcb bancorp s shareholders 
results of operations net income for was million  up million from million in and up million from net income of million 
basic and diluted earnings per share for were and  respectively  compared to basic and diluted earnings per share of and  respectively  in and basic and diluted in the june  acquisition of commonwealth and the opening of three de novo branches combined with a million net loss in the mortgage banking segment were the major factors impacting the company s earnings performance 
after absorbing additional costs associated with the opening of the new branches  the community banking segment generated an increase in net income of million  or in compared to the prior year 
this improvement  however  was largely offset by the decline in earnings in the mortgage banking segment 
net income from the mortgage banking segment of the company dropped from  for to a loss of million for the impact of the mark to market valuation for reduced the mortgage banking segment net income by  as outstanding unfunded interest rate lock commitments  adjusted for fallout rlc s declined by million from million at december  to million at december  the mortgage banking segment is discussed more fully later in this management s discussion 
the company s key profitability ratios of return on average assets roa and return on average equity roe compare favorably with the average of the company s national peer ratios of and  respectively  based on the september bank holding company performance report 
roa  which measures the company s stewardship of assets  was at  compared to in and in roe for the company was in  compared to in and in net interest income current year comparison vs 
the primary source of the company s earnings is net interest income  the difference between income on earning assets and the cost of funds supporting those assets 
significant categories of earning assets are loans and securities while deposits and short term borrowings represent the major portion of interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income  the largest contributor to earnings  was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the corresponding period in for purposes of the following discussion  comparison of net interest income is done on a tax equivalent basis  which provides a common basis for comparing yields on earning assets exempt from federal income taxes to those which are fully taxable 
as indicated in table i  tax equivalent net interest income totaled million for  an increase of million from the million reported in this million increase includes a million increase in earning assets  which were added to the portfolio at declining replacement rates 
this increase was partially offset by a million reduction in rate changes on the underlying assets as asset yields fell in the declining rate environment 
management was able to help offset the effect of the declining asset yield through aggressive management of deposit rates 
average earning assets increased million while interest bearing liabilities increased million 
as indicated in table i  the yield on average earning assets decreased basis points from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  however  this decrease was largely offset by a basis point decline in the cost of funds during the same periods leaving the net interest rate spread the difference between interest income on earning assets and expense on interest bearing liabilities at december  slightly lower at compared to for the same period last year 
the company s tax equivalent net interest margin of for the year ended december  decreased basis points from in the largest contributor to the decrease in the yield on average earning assets in  on a volume weighted basis  was the decrease in the overall tax equivalent yield on loans held for investment of basis points from the prior year to  as loans repriced downward in response to the declining rate environment while the average balance increased million 
the decline in asset yield is attributable to the recent interest rate environment which created refinancing or repricing incentives for fixed rate borrowers to lower their current borrowing costs 
in addition  due to the volume of loans directly tied to prime and other indices that are either adjustable incrementally or are variable rate advances  asset yields have declined in response to rate cuts and drops in the prime loan rate which began in  continued in and continues to remain at lows not seen in over years 
the balance of average loans held for sale decreased by million while the yield decreased basis points to 
the yield on loans held for sale is much more sensitive to interest rate change since these loans are only held for to days and are replenished with new loan volume at the then prevailing rates 
the change in rate on this pool of loans is reflective of the volatility experienced in mortgage rates and the underlying mortgage backed securities into which they are delivered 
the average secondary market loan delivered to investors through the company s mortgage subsidiary varied in rate during the current year from a high in january of to a low of in june during  the taxable equivalent yield on securities available for sale decreased basis points to while the average balance increased by million 
consistent with the current rate environment  the company and the securities industry as a whole have experienced rapid turnover in securities as higher yielding securities are either called or prepaid as the refinancing opportunity presented itself 
the increasing average security balance is the result of continued reinvestment of available funds largely created by higher average deposit levels 
both the average balance and tax equivalent yield on investment securities held to maturity remained relatively stable with a slight increase in yield of basis points to and a million decrease in average balance from securities held to maturity are largely comprised of tax free municipal securities 
compared to  average interest bearing balances with banks increased million while the yield increased basis points 
this average balance increase was largely the result of funds received from new deposit growth in existing markets and deposits obtained in the acquisition of greenville in the fourth quarter of and commonwealth in june as well as the continued cash flow roll off experienced in the loan and investment portfolio 
the company actively manages its product pricing by staying abreast of the current economic climate and competitive forces in order to enhance repricing opportunities available with respect to the liability side of its balance sheet 
in doing so  the cost of interest bearing liabilities decreased by basis points from in to for the same period of while the average volume increased million 
active deposit liability review and pricing management is performed weekly 
average short term borrowings  increased million in when compared to  because of additional borrowings assumed in the acquisition of commonwealth and a general increase in the level of retail repurchase agreements 
the average rate paid on these borrowings decreased basis points to in versus in average long term borrowings increased million because of the september issuance of million in trust preferred securities and the payment of an million advance from the fhlb 
the average rate paid on these borrowings decreased basis points in compared to in addition  the average balances of interest bearing demand and savings deposits increased and million  respectively  during while the corresponding average rate paid on these deposit categories declined and basis points  respectively 
average time deposits increased million while the average rate paid decreased basis points from in to in likewise  average fed funds and repurchase agreements increased million while the average rate decreased basis points 
the level of average non interest bearing demand deposits increased million to million in compared to approximately million of the million increase in average interest bearing deposit growth is attributable to the acquisitions of greenville million in the fourth quarter of and commonwealth million in june  respectively 
commonwealth also contributed significant non interest bearing deposit balances with its high balance deposit product for title companies and real estate settlement firms 
prior year comparison vs 
on a tax equivalent basis  net interest income increased million  or in compared to an increase of million  or in  in each case  over the prior year 
the increase in was the net result of an million increase due to the higher volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and a million increase due to changes in rates on these assets and liabilities 
the increase in net interest income in was primarily due to a million or increase in average earning assets over the increase in average earning assets was the result of an million increase in average total loans  an million increase in average investment securities and a million increase in other interest yielding deposits 
the cost of all interest bearing liabilities decreased to in  compared to in reflecting the steadily declining interest rate environment throughout the year 
the combined increase in average earning assets in of million was attributable in large part to the fourth quarter acquisition of four branches in virginia 
the balance of earning asset growth came in the form of internal or organic growth in existing branches  along with increased wholesale borrowings million and growth in average equity million 
average interest bearing liabilities increased million in  which included a million increase in interest bearing deposits 
additionally  there was a million increase in average non interest bearing demand deposits compared to the prior year 
the acquisition of bank of greenville in the fourth quarter of accounted for only million of the average interest bearing deposit balance increase in while the branch acquisitions in the fourth quarter of accounted for approximately million 
organic growth in was enhanced by significant merger activity in competing banks which assisted in customer acquisition and market share growth primarily in southern west virginia

rate and volume analysis of interest the following table summarizes the changes in interest earned and paid resulting from changes in volume of earning assets and paying liabilities and changes in their interest rates 
in this analysis  the change in interest due to both rate and volume has been allocated to the volume and rate columns in proportion to absolute dollar amounts 
this table will assist you in understanding the changes in the company s principal source of revenues  net interest income nii 
the principal themes or trends which are evident in this table include the significant increase in nii in resulting largely from branch growth downward repricing of liabilities in which exceeded declining loan and investment yields the resulting higher margin and net revenues in the beneficial effects of falling rates in lower growth in roughly half the rate of growth the limiting effect of low rates in as deposit rates hit floor levels and loan and investment rates continued to reprice downward the resulting shrinkage in margin which was overcome only by growth in average earning assets compared to compared to increase decrease due to increase decrease due to volume rate total volume rate total amounts in thousands interest earned on loans held for sale   loans      securities available for sale      securities held to maturity interest bearing deposits with other banks federal funds sold total interest earning assets       interest paid on demand deposits savings deposits time deposits       short term borrowings    long term debt total interest bearing liabilities       change in net interest income       fully taxable equivalent using a rate of 
non interest income current year comparison vs 
non interest income consists of all revenues which are not included in interest and fee income related to earning assets 
total non interest income increased approximately million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for gains on the sale of securities of million were the largest contributor to this increase  almost entirely due to the sale of certain short term equity investments in the third quarter of in addition  along with the increase in deposits created by new market areas served by the company  service charges on deposit accounts increased million  or primarily as the result of the company s overdraft program that allows well managed customer deposit accounts flexibility in managing overdrafts to their accounts 
other service charges  commissions and fees also increased million in compared to these fees are dependent upon customer behaviors and usage of the various products and services of the company and are transaction oriented 
revenues in this category include  among others  commissions on sales of credit life insurance and other fee sources of revenue including the revenues of stone capital and atm service charge revenues created in the newer market areas 
fiduciary earnings representing asset management fees on trust and agency accounts of million were consistent with the prior year 
all other operating income increased  non interest income in the mortgage banking subsidiary united first mortgage  inc ufm declined from million in to million in the end of unprecedented refinance activity in the latter half of the year  coupled with rate volatility and changes in price expectations by national investors who buy these loans and brokers who provide wholesale production  caused a decline of million in the fair value mark to market of the mortgage pipeline and related securities 
the following table details the components of ufm s mortgage banking income included in non interest income for the years ended december  for the periods indicated 
years ended december  amounts in thousands mortgage banking income loan sales and settlement component other service charges  commissions fees    gain on sale of loans    fee income    gain loss on closed derivatives    option expense mark to market component mark to market losses gains on commitments   mark to market securities total mortgage banking income    at december  interest rate lock commitments notional value   fair value  securities notional value   fair value at december   ufm held an investment in forward mortgage contracts with a notional value of million and mortgage backed security put options totaling million 
these contracts are used in an attempt to hedge interest rate risk associated with rlcs and closed loans not allocated to a forward commitment of million 
at december   the fair value of the securities was a liability of  which represents a  increase from the fair value at december  in addition  the fair value of the rlcs at december  was  which represents a million decline from the fair value at december  the market valuation of rlcs at december  assumes a rlc pull through 
if actual pull through in succeeding months proves to be more or less than  the full market value of rlcs may or may not be realized and or the valuation of rlcs may change 
for the year ended december   the company incurred million in the cost of forward mortgage derivative contracts and options to originate and sell million in loans compared to the prior year in which million in loans were originated for sale with underlying forward mortgage contracts that cost million 
the lower cost of forward mortgage contracts between the two years is reflective of the volatility of the pricing of these types of contracts during times of significant interest rate volatility 
although the pricing of the contracts was favorable to the company in the current year  ufm s pricing and margin on loans sold was substantially less favorable as a result of the market pricing dynamics and significant competitive forces 
the significant decrease in hedging cost  as well as the market price of loans sold  demonstrates the potential volatility to earnings and the sensitivity to pull through assumptions 
the cost of these derivative contracts is included as a component of mortgage banking income in the consolidated statements of income  which represents the net revenues associated with the origination  holding and sale of mortgage loans 
the shift to a loss in mortgage banking operations in stems from the aforementioned interest rate volatility and other factors that began late in the third quarter of  and in turn led to lower margins 
these losses  coupled with the expectation for lower volumes in  also led to an impairment charge of  relating to goodwill with respect to the mortgage banking segment during the fourth quarter of prior year comparison vs 
non interest income totaled million in  which is substantially unchanged from the million recognized in reflected changes in various categories of non interest income items in comparison to while service charges on deposit accounts increased million or  this was largely offset by declines in securities gains and losses  and a reduction in other operating income 
the company s mortgage banking segment recognized million in mortgage banking income in the level of mortgage banking income declined slightly from the prior year level of million 
the decrease  despite increased loan applications  was attributable to lower margins recognized on loan sales in the third and fourth quarters of the reduction in margin was attributable to lower than anticipated pull through rates closings versus commitments as mortgage rates fell to record lows and the earnings on a portion of the loan commitments outstanding were not realized 
higher than anticipated hedging cost reduced the margin on loan sales by approximately  in due to the increased cost of mortgage derivative commitments used to hedge the price volatility of loan commitments 
the inability of the mortgage company s hedge model to accurately predict loan fallout percentages experienced in the third and early in the fourth quarter resulted in higher than predicted fallout 
this fallout was due to loan applicants who opted out of the mortgage company s process prior to closing and  instead  reapplied elsewhere or simply waited on the sidelines for more declines in mortgage rates  as they continued to decline to historically unprecedented lows 
the hedge model  which predicted the need to invest at a specified level based upon historic information  failed to predict the sudden increase in fallout  and in turn  hedge volume was elevated when measured against the loan commitments which ultimately closed 
ufm originated million in loans during compared to the volume of million 
the corresponding sale of loans resulted in gains on the sale of loans during and of million and million  respectively 
elevated hedge costs in and increased expense associated with the higher volume of origination resulted in a drop in mortgage banking pre tax earnings from million in to  in pretax earnings for were further reduced by a  payment to a former mortgage company executive to settle employment obligations and to acquire a non compete agreement on his termination of employment 
fiduciary income continued at the million level in as it did in the level of trust and estate revenues remained relatively consistent in even though the total market value of the assets managed declined during other service charges  commissions and fees of approximately million also remained relatively consistent in and other service charges  commissions and fees declined by  in compared to during  the company experienced a net loss from available for sale securities of  the loss included an other than temporary  write down of a municipal issue  losses from the sale of securities of  and gains resulting from securities sold and called of  during  a net gain of  was realized as a result of the sale of available for sale securities with gains of  and losses of  non interest expense current year comparison vs 
non interest expense totaled million for increasing million  or over year end this increase is primarily attributable to a million increase in salaries and benefits as a result of the addition of greenville in late  the addition of commonwealth in june  as well as a general increase in salaries and benefits as staffing needs at several locations were satisfied in order to support added corporate services and continued branch growth  including three newly established branches in winston salem  north carolina 
in  occupancy and furniture and equipment expense increased by  compared to the general level of occupancy cost grew largely as a result of the greenville  and commonwealth acquisitions  as well as increases in depreciation and insurance costs associated with new de novo branches  and depreciation associated with a significant investment in operating equipment and technology infrastructure 
during the fourth quarter of  the company performed its annual impairment test on goodwill 
the results of the impairment tests indicated a charge of approximately  was appropriate for the mortgage banking segment 
this charge was included in the non interest expense category and as a reduction to goodwill on the balance sheet 
all other operating expense accounts increased  or in compared to again  this increase was largely attributable to the monroe financial  inc monroe or greenville acquisition in late and the commonwealth acquisition along with the three de novo branches opened in the second  third and fourth quarters of the company s net overhead ratio non interest expense less non interest income excluding security gains and non recurring gains divided by average earning assets is a measure of its ability to manage and control costs 
as this ratio decreases  more of the net interest income earned is realized as net income 
the net overhead ratios for   and were   and  respectively 
the increase in the overhead ratio for and reflects the additional costs associated with the aforementioned expansion efforts as part of the company s strategic plan for the development of its banking network in metro markets and the added infrastructure cost necessary to support the growth of the company 
the company s efficiency ratio also measures management s ability to control costs and maximize net revenues 
the efficiency ratio is computed by dividing non interest expense by the sum of net interest income plus non interest income excluding security gains and losses  amortization of intangibles and impairment charges 
the efficiency ratios for   and were   and  respectively 
increases in the current and prior year are reflective of the higher direct costs associated with the acquisitions and new branches in late and in and added corporate overhead required to support company expansion 
prior year comparison vs 
non interest expense totaled million in  compared with million in the increase in non interest expense in of million is primarily attributable to a million increase in salaries and benefits  million of which was due to the acquisition of the four branches in the fourth quarter of  along with a  increase in salaries and commissions in the mortgage operations of ufm primarily attributable to increased loan production and a general increase in salaries as staffing needs at several locations were satisfied in order to support added corporate services and continued branch growth 
in addition  the combined impact of increases in other non interest expense categories of million is attributable to increased operating expenses from the branch acquisitions  increased operations of ufm  and additional increases of million in other non interest expense categories including costs associated with occupancy and facilities maintenance  data communications and marketing campaigns 
these expenses were offset by the decline in goodwill amortization of million 
occupancy expense increased  or between and the increase primarily consists of  related to the full year s occupancy costs of the branch facilities purchased in fourth quarter  and additional costs of  associated with ufm 
with the adoption of fasb statement no 
 the company ceased amortization of certain goodwill beginning january  as required by the statement and with the adoption of statement in october  amortization of remaining goodwill associated with branch acquisitions was discontinued 
cessation of such amortization decreased goodwill expense in by million compared to this resulted in an additional million in after tax net income in comparison to the prior year 
other operating expense increased by million in compared to these accounts include increases in other operating costs associated with ufm of  tied to increased loan production and the payment of a  contract settlement with the retiring president of ufm in connection with his departure 
other increased expenses  largely due to the acquisition of the new branches  included an increase in telephone and data communications expense of  an increase in atm service fees of  and an increase in courier and travel expense of  advertising expense was also up  in comparison to due to ad campaigns for new products and branch promotions

the primary category of non taxable income is that of state and municipal securities and industrial revenue bonds and tax free loans 
the effective tax rate for was compared with for and in the reduction in the company s effective tax rate in was partially attributable to the cessation of amortization of non deductible goodwill while the slight increase in is the result of a decline in tax free revenue sources as a percentage of total net revenues 
financial position securities held to maturity investment securities held to maturity are comprised largely of us agency obligations and state and municipal bonds 
obligations of states and political subdivisions represent the largest portion of the held to maturity portfolio and totaled million at december  these are comprised of high grade municipal securities generally carrying aaa bond ratings  most of which also carry credit enhancement insurance by major insurers of investment obligations 
the average final maturity of the investment portfolio decreased from years in to years in with the tax equivalent yield increasing from at year end to at the close of the average maturity of the investment portfolio  based on market assumptions for prepayment  is years and years at december and  respectively 
the average maturity data differs from final maturity data because of the use of assumptions as to anticipated prepayments 
securities available for sale at december   the company had million in securities available for sale  compared with million at year end  an increase of million or 
during the year million in securities were purchased 
however  these increases were offset by maturities  calls  and mortgage backed security principal payments and prepayments of million  and sales of million 
the fair value of securities available for sale exceeded book value at year end by million  compared with million at year end the market value appreciation reflects changes declines in interest rates on comparable securities since acquisition 
the market value appreciation declined by million between and as a result of changes in rates during and changes in the composition of the portfolio 
fueled by calls and mortgage backed security principal payments and prepayments of higher yielding securities throughout the year  a reduction in the appreciated value of the portfolio occurred as the balances of higher yielding securities declined 
reinvestment in comparable securities resulted in lower yields with prices closer to current market rates 
the tax equivalent purchase yield on securities available for sale was in and in the average final maturity of the available for sale portfolio was years and years at december  and  respectively 
the change in average final maturity was the result of the million in calls  principal payments and prepayments that occurred as a result of the declining interest rate environment while reinvestment in comparable securities resulted in extending the average contractual maturity of the portfolio by years 
the average maturity of the portfolio  based on market assumptions for prepayment  was years and years  respectively  at december  and  substantially shorter than the average final maturity 
securities available for sale are used as part of management s asset liability strategy 
these securities may be sold in response to changes in interest rates  changes in prepayment risk  for liquidity needs and other factors 
these securities are carried at market value 
loan portfolio loans held for sale the relative size of the portfolio of loans originated by the company s mortgage banking division  ufm  and held for sale  was impacted significantly by the refinancing activity that occurred during and as a result of the low interest rate environment 
loans held for sale fluctuate on a daily basis reflecting retail originations  wholesale purchases and sales to investors 
at december   loans held for sale were million compared to million at december  average loans held for sale which is a better indicator of volume maintained decreased million in loans held for investment total loans held for investment increased million from million at december  to billion at december  the increase is attributable to the commonwealth acquisition approximately million at june  net of several large payoffs during considering an million increase in deposits and the increase in loans during  the loan to deposit ratio increased slightly at december  compared to the december  level 
the loan to deposit ratio  using only loans held for investment excluding loans held for sale  was on december  and on december  intense competition for loans in the face of low interest rates and what appears to be slower loan demand continue to impact this measure of loan production 
resulting liquidity during the period has been reinvested in the available for sale securities portfolio 
the average balance of loans held for investment increased million when comparing to this increase includes approximately million in average loans acquired in the monroe acquisition in the fourth quarter of and million in average loans from the commonwealth acquisition on june  net of the large commercial loan payoffs mentioned earlier and regular amortization in the held for investment loan portfolio continues to be diversified among loan types and industry segments

allowance and provision for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level sufficient to absorb probable loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the allowance is increased by charges to earnings in the form of provisions for loan losses and recoveries of prior loan charge offs  and decreased by loans charged off 
the provision for loan losses is calculated to bring the reserve to a level  which  according to a systematic process of measurement  is reflective of the required amount needed to absorb probable losses 
management performs monthly assessments to determine the appropriate level of allowance 
differences between actual loan loss experience and estimates are reflected through adjustments that are made by either increasing or decreasing the loss provision based upon current measurement criteria 
commercial  consumer and mortgage loan portfolios are evaluated separately for purposes of determining the allowance 
the specific components of the allowance include allocations to individual commercial credits and allocations to the remaining non homogeneous and homogeneous pools of loans 
management s allocations are based on judgment of qualitative and quantitative factors about both the macro and micro economic conditions reflected within the portfolio of loans and the economy as a whole 
factors considered in this evaluation include  but are not necessarily limited to  probable losses from loan and other credit arrangements  general economic conditions  changes in credit concentrations or pledged collateral  historical loan loss experience  and trends in portfolio volume  maturity  composition  delinquencies  and non accruals 
while management has attributed the allowance for loan losses to various portfolio segments  the allowance is available for the entire portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses was million on december   compared to million at december  and million on december  the allowance for loan losses represents of non performing loans at december   versus and at december  and  respectively 
when other real estate is combined with non performing loans  the allowance equals of non performing assets at december  versus and at december  and december   respectively 
the increase in the allowance since year end is primarily attributable to the acquisition of commonwealth and the application of risk factors specific to this portfolio 
the allowance attributable to the commonwealth portfolio at the date of acquisition was million 
the provision for loan losses for the year ended december  decreased  when compared to the year ended december  the decrease is largely attributable to improving asset quality and loan loss history  changes in risk factors assigned and a decline in volume within certain portfolio segments 
net charge offs for and were million and million  respectively 
although net charge offs increased in compared to  expressed as a percentage of average loans held for investment  net charge offs decreased from for  to for due to the increase in average loans of million 
the provision for loan losses was million in  million in and million in the provision of million decreased by more than  from in response to continuing improvements in asset quality and only modest growth in the loan portfolio year over year 
the decline in the provision was consistent with the noted improvements in all categories of non performing loans and other real estate owned 
the provision of million was elevated in response to charge offs in coupled with larger charge offs of commercial credits in as the company pursued workout and resolution of two commercial loans in non accrual status 
based on the allowance for loan losses of approximately million and million at december  and  respectively  the allowance to loans held for investment ratio was in vs 
for management considers the allowance adequate based upon its analysis of the portfolio as of december  net loan charge offs were million in  compared with million in and million in  respectively 
although net charge offs increased in compared to  expressed as a percentage of average loans held for investment  net charge offs decreased from for  to for due to the increase in average loans of million

non performing assets non performing assets include loans on which interest accruals have ceased  loans contractually past due days or more and still accruing interest  and other real estate owned oreo pursuant to foreclosure proceedings 
the levels of non performing assets for the last five years are presented in the following table

the decrease in non accrual loans resulted from the resolution of a number of loan relationships through payment  repossession  or foreclosure and write down of the loan balances to reflect the net realizable value of the assets 
the decrease in loans days or more past due is a result of movement of these credits to non accrual status and a more aggressive approach in collecting loans past due days or more 
certain loans included in the non accrual category have been written down to the estimated realizable value or have been assigned specific reserves within the allowance for loan losses based upon management s estimate of loss upon ultimate resolution 
during  and    and  of assets were acquired through foreclosure and transferred to other real estate owned 
in addition to non performing loans reflected in the foregoing table  the company has identified certain performing loans as impaired based upon management s evaluation of credit strength  projected ability to repay in accordance with the contractual terms of the loans and varying degrees of dependence on the sale of related collateral for liquidation of the loans 
these loans were current under loan terms and were classified as performing at year end the following table presents the company s investment in loans considered to be impaired and related information on those impaired loans amounts in thousands recorded investment in loans considered to be impaired    loans considered to be impaired that were on a non accrual basis    allowance for loan losses related to loans considered to be impaired    average recorded investment in impaired loans    total interest income recognized on impaired loans included in the table above is a loan relationship in the amount of million which is secured by a hotel property which has suffered declines in levels of occupancy 
the allowance for loan losses related to this loan was million at december  this was the company s largest impaired loan at december  the company has considered all impaired loans in the evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses at december  additional information regarding nonperforming loans can be found in note included in the financial statements under item of this report 
nonperforming loans december  amounts in thousands non accrual loans      loans past due over days and still accruing interest    restructured loans performing in accordance with modified terms gross interest income which would have been recorded under original terms of non accruing and restructured loans actual interest income during the period potential problems loans in addition to loans which are classified as non performing and impaired  the company closely monitors certain loans which could develop into problem loans 
these potential problem loans present characteristics of weakness or concentrations of credit to one borrower 
among these loans at december  was a loan of million which warrants close monitoring to a borrower within the hospitality industry 
the loan represents the retained portion of a million total loan shared with a participating bank 
as with other hospitality industry firms  the borrower has experienced reduced cash flow associated with declines in the level of hotel occupancy 
the loan is secured by real estate improved with a national franchise hotel and parking building in a major southeast city 
the loan is further secured by the guarantee of the principals of the borrowing entity 
this loan  which was originated in  performed according to terms until it displayed delinquency in february and march and was subsequently brought current 
the loan remains current as to principal and interest at december  the loan has not been converted to non accrual status based upon its secured position  historical performance and strength of guarantors 
this loan does  however  represent one of the company s largest credits and is within an industry which has suffered from declining performance in there were no specific allocations of the allowance for loan losses for any of the foregoing potential problem loans as of december  the company is also monitoring a million loan to a hospitality borrower for a new property opened in the construction and opening of the hotel  which secures this loan was delayed and occupancy has not reached projected levels necessary to adequately fund current debt service requirements 
the loan is guaranteed by the principals and is senior to a  loan by the sba 
the million senior loan became days delinquent in february and the borrower has requested conversion to interest only payments for one year to allow time for stabilization of occupancy and cash flow for the property 
the company has delayed consideration of the modification request until the principals restore the loan to current status and pending the company s request for additional collateral 
the ultimate resolution of the issues dealing with the modification is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements 
the company had no foreign outstanding loans at december  although the company s loans are made primarily in the three state region in which it operates  the company had no concentrations of loans to one borrower or industry representing or more of outstanding loans at december  deposits total deposits have grown million or since year end as a result of the acquisition of commonwealth

this category of liabilities represents wholesale sources of funding and liquidity for the company 
short term borrowings increased on average approximately million in comparison to the prior year 
the increase in average short term borrowings in  along with the increase in average deposits of million  was accompanied by an increase in total loans as these funds were used to finance the average loans held for investment portfolio growth million and the average increase in available for sale securities million 
the price sensitivity of funding cost is managed by the company s product group  which monitors product and pricing initiatives including  among other things  the management of the overall cost of funds to assist in maintaining an acceptable net interest margin  and to act as a resource in developing new products and establishing pricing guidelines

the callable advances may be called redeemed at quarterly intervals after various lockout periods 
these call options may substantially shorten the lives of these instruments 
if these advances are called  the debt may be paid in full  converted to another fhlb credit product  or converted to an adjustable rate advance 
at december  and  respectively  the company also held non callable term advances of million and million

the company uses sources of funds primarily to meet ongoing commitments  to pay maturing savings certificates and savings withdrawals  fund loan commitments and maintain a portfolio of securities 
at december   approved loan commitments outstanding amounted to million 
certificates of deposit scheduled to mature in one year or less totaled million 
management believes that the company has adequate resources to fund outstanding commitments and could either adjust rates on certificates of deposit in order to retain or attract deposits in changing interest rate environments or replace such deposits with advances from the fhlb or other funds providers if it proved to be cost effective to do so

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the bank s profitability is dependent to a large extent upon its net interest income nii  which is the difference between its interest income on interest earning assets  such as loans and securities  and its interest expense on interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits and borrowings 
the bank  like other financial institutions  is subject to interest rate risk to the degree that its interest earning assets reprice differently than its interest bearing liabilities 
the bank manages its mix of assets and liabilities with the goals of limiting its exposure to interest rate risk  ensuring adequate liquidity  and coordinating its sources and uses of funds while maintaining an acceptable level of nii given the current interest rate environment 
the company s primary component of operational revenue  nii  is subject to variation as a result of changes in interest rate environments in conjunction with unbalanced repricing opportunities on earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
interest rate risk has four primary components including repricing risk  basis risk  yield curve risk and option risk 
repricing risk occurs when earning assets and paying liabilities reprice at differing times as interest rates change 
basis risk occurs when the underlying rates on the assets and liabilities the institution holds change at different levels or in varying degrees 
yield curve risk is the risk of adverse consequences as a result of unequal changes in the spread between two or more rates for different maturities for the same instrument 
lastly  option risk is due to embedded options often called put or call options given or sold to holders of financial instruments 
in order to mitigate the effect of changes in the general level of interest rates  the company manages repricing opportunities and thus  its interest rate sensitivity 
the bank seeks to control its interest rate risk irr exposure to insulate net interest income and net earnings from fluctuations in the general level of interest rates 
to measure its exposure to irr  quarterly simulations of nii are performed using financial models that project nii through a range of possible interest rate environments including rising  declining  most likely and flat rate scenarios 
the results of these simulations indicate the existence and severity of irr in each of those rate environments based upon the current balance sheet position  assumptions as to changes in the volume and mix of interest earning assets and interest paying liabilities and management s estimate of yields to be attained in those future rate environments and rates that will be paid on various deposit instruments and borrowings 
specific strategies for management of irr have included shortening the amortized maturity of new fixed rate loans  increasing the volume of adjustable rate loans to reduce the average maturity of the bank s interest earning assets and monitoring the term structure of liabilities to maintain a balanced mix of maturity and repricing structures to mitigate the potential exposure 
the simulation model used by the company captures all earning assets  interest bearing liabilities and all off balance sheet financial instruments and combines the various factors affecting rate sensitivity into an earnings outlook 
based upon the latest simulation  the company believes that it is biased toward an asset sensitive position 
absent adequate management  asset sensitive positions can negatively impact net interest income in a falling rate environment or  alternatively  positively impact net interest income in a rising rate environment 
the company has established policy limits for tolerance of interest rate risk that allow for no more than a reduction in projected nii based on quarterly income simulations compared to forecasted results 
in addition  the policy addresses exposure limits to changes in the economic value of equity eve according to predefined policy guidelines 
the most recent simulation indicates that current exposure to interest rate risk is within the company s defined policy limits as short term rates are anticipated to move upward in the latter half of the following table summarizes the impact on nii and the eve as of december  and  respectively  of immediate and sustained rate shocks in the interest rate environment of plus and minus basis points and plus basis points from the flat rate simulation 
the results of the rate shock analysis depicted below differ from the results in quarterly simulations  in that all changes are assumed to take effect immediately  whereas  in the quarterly income simulations  changes in interest rates are assumed to take place over a month horizon simulating a more likely scenario for a changing rate environment 
this table  which illustrates the prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes  is based upon numerous assumptions including relative and estimated levels of key interest rates over a twelve month time period 
this type of modeling technique  although useful  does not take into account all strategies that management might undertake in response to a sudden and sustained rate shock as depicted 
also  as market conditions vary from those assumed in the sensitivity analysis  actual results will also differ due to prepayment refinancing levels likely deviating from those assumed  the varying impact of interest rate change caps or floors on adjustable rate assets  the potential effect of changing debt service levels on customers with adjustable rate loans  depositor early withdrawals and product preference changes  and other internal external variables 
rate sensitivity analysis net interest market value increase decrease in interest rates basis points income change of equity change amounts in thousands net interest market value increase decrease in interest rates basis points income change of equity change amounts in thousands when comparing the impact of the rate shock analysis between and  the changes in nii reflect the impact of the balance sheet composition of assets and liabilities as the profile continues to reflect asset sensitivity in a falling rate environment as more assets prepay and net interest income declines 
the change results in heightened asset prepayment levels experienced in light of the interest rate environment modeled 
the asset sensitivity is reflected in on hand liquidity of million federal funds sold and interest bearing balances held with other banks 
the company continues to reinvest excess funds into new assets loans and securities to support net interest income 
the company began to experience a shift in the balance sheet toward greater asset sensitivity in which was attributed to the reduced lives of certain assets and the control measures taken in prior years  and continuing throughout  to reduce deposit cost and identify opportunities for product and net interest income enhancement in response to the current rate environment 
the market value of equity is a measure which reflects the impact of changing rates on the underlying value of the company in a hypothetical scenario analysis 
the value of equity within this analysis is favorably responsive to the impact of rising rates 
the company changed modeling tools in and the result provided more accurate measures of non maturity deposits and the results for give greater weight to the value of these deposits as rates rise
