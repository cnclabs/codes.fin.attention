item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
cautionary statement the discussion below contains forward looking statements regarding our financial condition and the results of operations that are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted within the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis 
these estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
we operate in a highly competitive environment that involves a number of risks  some of which are beyond our control 
we are subject to risks common to biopharmaceutical companies  including risks inherent in our research  development and commercialization efforts  preclinical testing  clinical trials  uncertainty of regulatory and marketing approvals  reliance on collaborative partners  enforcement of patent and proprietary rights  the need for future capital  potential competition associated with our product candidates  use of hazardous materials and retention of key employees 
in order for one of our product candidates to be commercialized  it will be necessary for us to conduct preclinical tests and clinical trials  demonstrate efficacy and safety of our product candidate to the satisfaction of regulatory authorities  obtain marketing approval  enter into manufacturing  distribution and marketing arrangements  obtain market acceptance and  in many cases  obtain adequate reimbursement from government and private insurers 
we cannot provide assurance that we will generate significant revenues or achieve and sustain profitability in the future 
statements contained in management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations which are not historical facts are  or may constitute  forward looking statements 
forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks that could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected results 
these risks are discussed in the section entitled risk factors 
although we believe the expectations reflected in the forward looking statements are reasonable  we cannot guarantee future results  levels of activity  performance or achievements 
our operating expenses are difficult to predict and will depend on several factors 
development expenses  including expenses for drug synthesis and manufacturing  preclinical testing and clinical research activities  will depend on the ongoing requirements of our drug development programs  availability of capital and direction from regulatory agencies  which are difficult to predict 
management may in some cases be able to control the timing of development expenses in part by accelerating or decelerating preclinical testing  other discovery and basic research activities and clinical trial activities  but many of these expenditures will occur irrespective of whether our product candidates are approved when anticipated or at all 
we have begun to incur significant selling and marketing expenses to successfully commercialize our products 
once again  management may in some cases be able to control the timing of these expenses  but many of these expenditures will occur irrespective of the commercial success of our products  at least initially 
as a result of these factors  we believe that period to period comparisons are not necessarily meaningful and you should not rely on them as an indication of future performance 
due to all of the foregoing factors  it is possible that our consolidated operating results will be below the expectations of market analysts and investors 
in such event  the prevailing market price of our common stock could be materially adversely affected 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to discovering  developing and commercializing prescription products in disease areas with significant commercial markets and unmet medical needs 
our primary focus is in the ophthalmic and respiratory therapeutic areas where we have significant expertise 
our ophthalmic products and product candidates are concentrated in the allergic conjunctivitis  dry eye disease and retinal detachment indications 
we are working on respiratory product candidates for the treatment of cystic fibrosis and upper respiratory disorders 
we have acquired the rights to market elestat and restasis in the united states under co promotion agreements with allergan and we receive royalty payments based upon net sales of these products 
we have five product candidates in various stages of clinical development and one product candidate identified in preclinical development for which we expect to file an ind 
our product candidates in clinical trials are based on proprietary technology relating to specific receptors known as p receptors 
our lead product candidates are py receptor agonists that target ophthalmology  allergy and respiratory conditions and diseases where current treatments are not adequate 
we have begun to apply our expertise to other applications of p receptor subtypes as well as advancing several non py programs 
we were incorporated in october and commenced operations in march following our first substantial financing and licensing of the initial technology from unc 
since that time  we have been engaged in the discovery and development of novel pharmaceutical products  and more recently  in the co promotion of products 
we are located in durham  north carolina  adjacent to the research triangle park 
to date  we have not derived any revenue from product sales  although  we expect to have royalty revenue from product sales in our first quarter financial results 
as of december   our revenues have consisted of payments under various corporate partnerships 
we have recently built a commercial organization  including a small  specialty sales force  and began marketing elestat for allergic conjunctivitis and restasis for dry eye disease in the first quarter of we will be receiving a royalty on net sales of both of these products under the terms of our collaboration agreements in which we co promote these products in the united states with allergan 
we have historically devoted substantially all of our efforts to discovery and clinical development of our product candidates as well as establishing strategic partnerships for the development and commercialization of our products when approved 
on june   we submitted an nda to the fda and we were notified that our nda was granted a priority review on july  on december   we received an approvable letter from the fda 
in january  we met with the fda to discuss the additional clinical study which they requested 
based upon this discussion  we now have a clear understanding of the fda s additional requirement for the regulatory approval of diquafosol and are working closely with them to develop a protocol for a new phase iii clinical study 
we intend to initiate and begin enrollment in a confirmatory phase iii trial in early in addition  we are assisting allergan in a european regulatory submission that will seek approval of the right to commercialize diquafosol for dry eye disease in the european union 
submission of this application is expected in the second half of we have incurred significant operating losses since our inception and  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect to incur losses for the next several years 
we have financed our operations through proceeds received from the sale of equity securities including private sales of preferred stock  the sale of common stock in our initial public offering  an additional public offering of common stock in march  as well as revenues received under corporate collaborations 
we operate in a single business segment and do not have any foreign operations 
in december  we entered into an agreement with allergan to co promote elestat in the united states 
allergan records all product sales and retains all product costs and licensing rights  with the exception of primary selling  promotional and marketing activities in the united states which will be our responsibility 
under the terms of the agreement  we paid allergan an up front payment and allergan will pay a royalty to us on united states elestat net sales 
in june  we entered into a joint license  development and marketing agreement with allergan to develop and commercialize diquafosol which included the right to co promote restasis in the united states  and amended this agreement in december under the terms of this agreement  we have received up front and milestone payments of million and may receive up to an additional million in milestone payments assuming the successful completion of all remaining diquafosol milestones 
in addition  we had the ability to co promote restasis and diquafosol and exercised this right in the third quarter of restasis received fda approval and we began co promotion activities in january allergan records all product sales and retains all product costs and licensing rights with the exception of costs for our domestic sales force which is our responsibility 
we are to receive royalty revenue based upon restasis net sales and diquafosol royalty revenue for worldwide  except asia  net sales if and when the product candidate is approved by regulatory agencies 
we will begin to receive royalty revenue on restasis net sales in april in october  we entered into a study funding agreement with the cfft in which they agreed to fund the majority of the external costs of a phase ii trial for the treatment of cystic fibrosis in exchange for a milestone payment upon fda approval  and the possibility of a sales milestone upon the commercialization and the achievement of a certain aggregate sales volume in the first five years following product approval 
in the event of fda approval  we are obligated to pay  over a period of five years  a development milestone to the cfft equal to a multiple of the trial costs incurred by the cfft  which could exceed million 
additionally  in the event aggregate sales of the product exceed a certain level  we are obligated to pay the cfft an additional million sales milestone  payable over two years 
in december  we entered into a development  license and supply agreement with santen for the development of diquafosol for the therapeutic treatment of ocular surface diseases 
we are obligated to supply santen with its requirements of diquafosol in bulk drug substance form for all preclinical studies  clinical trials and commercial requirements at agreed upon prices 
under the agreement  we received an up front equity investment of million for shares of our stock and a milestone payment of  in addition  if all milestones are met  we could receive additional payments of up to million  as well as royalties on net sales of licensed products 
santen is developing diquafosol in japan and nine other asian countries  and is currently in phase ii clinical trials 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principals  require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates  judgments and the policies underlying these estimates on a periodic basis as the situation changes  and regularly discuss financial events  policies  and issues with members of our audit committee and our independent auditors 
we routinely evaluate our estimates and policies regarding revenue recognition  taxes and clinical trial  preclinical toxicology and manufacturing liabilities 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue under our collaborative research and development agreements when we have performed services under such agreements or when we or our collaborative partner has met a contractual milestone triggering a payment to us 
non refundable fees received at the initiation of collaborative agreements for which we have an ongoing research and development commitment are deferred and recognized ratably over the period of ongoing research and clinical development commitment 
we are also entitled to receive milestone payments under our collaborative research and development agreements based upon achievement of development milestones by us or our collaborative partners 
we recognize milestone payments as revenues ratably over the remaining period of our research and development commitment 
the recognition period begins at the date the milestone is achieved and acknowledged by the collaborative partner  which is generally at the date payment is received from the collaborative partner  and ends on the date that we have fulfilled our research and development commitment 
this period is based on estimates by management and the progress towards milestones in our collaborative agreements 
the estimate is subject to revision as our development efforts progress and we gain knowledge regarding required additional development 
revisions in the commitment period are made in the period that the facts related to the change first become known 
this may cause our revenue to fluctuate from period to period 
taxes significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of million as of december   due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain net operating losses carried forward  before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on estimates of taxable income in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
liabilities we generally enter into contractual agreements with third party vendors to provide clinical  preclinical toxicology  manufacturing and other services in the ordinary course of business 
many of these contracts are subject to milestone based invoicing and the contract could be conducted over an extended period of time 
we record liabilities under these contractual commitments when we determine an obligation has been incurred  regardless of the timing of the invoice 
because of the nature of contracts and related delay in the contract s invoicing  the obligation to these vendors may be based upon management s estimate of the underlying obligation 
in all cases  actual results may differ from our estimates 
impact of inflation although it is difficult to predict the impact of inflation on our costs and revenues in connection with our products  we do not anticipate that inflation will materially impact our cost of operation or the profitability of our products when marketed 
results of operations years ended december   and revenues our revenues for the year ended december  were million  compared to million in  and million in revenues in each year were derived primarily from collaborative research and development agreements with strategic partners 
milestone payments from our collaborative partners are recognized over the period of ongoing research and development commitment under the applicable collaborative agreement 
fluctuations in revenue between the periods relate to the timing and magnitude of milestone payments and amortization of deferred revenue recognized under our collaborative agreements 
the increase in revenues  as compared to  relates to the achievement of a milestone payment with our strategic partner allergan 
the decrease in revenues  as compared to  relates primarily to the termination of our collaborative agreements with genentech  inc and kissei pharmaceutical co  ltd  which resulted in no revenue related to these agreements being recorded in we expect to generate royalty revenue on elestat in the first quarter of and restasis royalty revenue in the second quarter of  but do not expect this revenue to exceed our operating expenses 
our future revenue will depend on whether we enter into additional collaboration agreements  achieve milestones under existing or future collaboration agreements  regulatory approvals  commercialization of our product candidates and net sales of restasis and elestat 
costs and expenses research and development expenses research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million  compared to million in and million in research and development expenses vary according to the number of programs in preclinical and clinical development and the stage of development of our clinical programs 
later stage clinical programs tend to cost more than earlier stage programs  due to the length of the trial and the number of patients enrolled in later stage clinical trials 
the increase in expenses  as compared to  relates to increased spending on our clinical programs  particularly our ins intranasal program  in which we completed a phase iii study in perennial allergic rhinitis in  and our ins ophthalmic program 
also in october  we entered into a research and development agreement with the cfft  whereby the majority of the expenses for a phase ii ins respiratory proof of concept clinical trial are funded by the cfft  but we also record the corresponding expenses and liabilities as the cfft incurs these costs 
the majority of the costs associated with this trial have been incurred in if we receive fda approval for ins respiratory for the treatment of cystic fibrosis  we will be obligated to pay a development milestone  and possibly a sales milestone  to the cfft 
if we do not receive fda approval  we will have no financial obligation to the cfft  including the phase ii clinical trial costs the cfft is currently funding on our behalf 
as of december   we have recorded approximately million of contingent liabilities associated with this agreement 
the decrease in research and development expenses in  as compared to  was due to our efforts to focus our resources on our higher priority clinical programs in the ophthalmology and respiratory areas  whereby we reduced the number of high priority clinical programs from six to four and reduced other discovery and development costs by decreasing the magnitude of preclinical and early stage clinical research and development programs between the two years 
research and development expenses include all direct costs  including salaries for our research and development personnel  consulting fees  clinical trial costs  sponsored research and clinical trial insurance  license fees and other fees and costs related to the development of product candidates 
our research and development expenses for the years ended december    and from the project s inception are shown below in thousands 
year ended december  cumulative from inception october  to december  ins intranasal denufosol tetrasodium diquafosol tetrasodium ins ins respiratory denufosol tetrasodium ins diagnostic uridine triphosphate ins ophthalmic denufosol tetrasodium other discovery and development costs total 

other discovery and development costs represent all unallocated research and development costs or those costs allocated to preclinical projects 
these costs include personnel costs of our discovery programs  internal and external general research costs and other internal and external costs of other drug discovery and development programs 
our future research and development expenses will depend on the results and magnitude of our clinical  preclinical and discovery activities and requirements imposed by regulatory agencies 
accordingly  our development expenses may fluctuate significantly from period to period 
in addition  if we in license or out license rights to product candidates  our development expenses may fluctuate significantly from prior periods 
selling and marketing expenses selling and marketing costs for the year ended december  were million  compared to  in and  in the increase in selling and marketing expenses in  as compared to  resulted from increases in personnel and other administrative costs from building our sales and marketing infrastructure for the co promotion of elestat and restasis 
in december  we began hiring territory managers and regional sales directors to provide us with national sales coverage for our ophthalmic products 
our commercial organization will focus its promotional efforts on ophthalmologists  optometrists and allergists 
the decrease in expenses  as compared to  resulted from lower personnel costs in future selling and marketing expenses will depend on the level of our future commercialization activities 
we expect our sales and marketing expenses to increase in when the building of our commercial infrastructure is complete and we begin to co promote restasis and elestat 
we expect selling and marketing expenses will increase in periods that immediately precede and follow product launches 
we also expect to experience seasonality in the sale of elestat  with a large increase in sales in the spring and a lesser increase during the summer and fall 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative costs for the year ended december  were million  compared to million in and million in our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and related costs for general corporate functions  including business development  finance  accounting  legal  human resources  quality assurance  facilities and information systems 
the increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily due to our increased development activities  building a sales and marketing infrastructure  and overall corporate growth as we prepared for the co promotion of restasis and elestat 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses in  as compared to  resulted from our efforts to focus our resources on our higher priority clinical programs in the ophthalmic and respiratory areas 
by focusing our clinical efforts  we were able to reduce the corporate and administrative efforts needed to support the company 
the decreases occurred primarily in personnel costs and additional professional services  including legal and public relation expense 
future general and administrative expenses will depend on the level of our future development and commercialization activities 
other income expense other income  net totaled  for the year ended december   compared to  for and million for other income fluctuates from year to year based upon fluctuations in the interest income earned on variable cash and investment balances and realized gains and losses on investments offset by interest expense on debt obligations 
the increase in other income  as compared to  represents larger interest income earned on higher average cash and investment balances offset by interest expense and increased losses on our investments  including a write down on our strategic investment in parion sciences  inc the decrease in other income  as compared to  resulted from lower interest income earned on smaller cash balances than in future other income will depend on our future cash and investment balances  the return on these investments  as well as levels of debt and the associated interest rates 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations through the sale of equity securities  including private sales of preferred stock  the sale of common stock in our initial public offering and an additional public offering in march at december   we had net working capital of million  an increase of approximately million from million at december  the increase in working capital is principally due to our successful offering of common stock in march  offset by the use of funds for our normal operating expenses 
in march  we completed the sale of million shares of common stock including the full exercise of the underwriters over allotment option in a public offering at per share 
the total net proceeds  after deducting offering costs  were million 
our principal sources of liquidity at december  were million in cash and cash equivalents  million in investments which are considered available for sale  million of restricted deposits and million of strategic corporate investments  reflecting a million increase of cash  cash equivalents and investment balances over those at december  our working capital requirements may fluctuate in future periods depending on many factors  including the efficiency of manufacturing processes developed on our behalf by third parties  the magnitude  scope and timing of our drug development programs  the cost  timing and outcome of regulatory reviews and changes in regulatory requirements  the costs of obtaining patent protection for our product candidates  the timing and terms of business development activities  the rate of technological advances relevant to our operations  the timing  method and cost of the commercialization of our product candidates  the level of required administrative and legal support  the availability of capital to support product candidate development programs we pursue  the commercial potential of our products and product candidates  and the potential expansion of facility space 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and investments will be adequate to satisfy our anticipated working capital requirements through the second quarter of we are targeting operating expenses of million 
however  we expect that we will be required to raise additional capital to fund our future operations through equity or debt financings or from other sources 
additional funding may not be available on favorable terms from any of these sources or at all 
our ability to achieve our operating expense target range is subject to several risks including unanticipated cost overruns  the need to expand the magnitude of scope of existing development programs  the need to change the number or timing of clinical trials  unanticipated regulatory requirements  costs to successfully commercialize our products and product candidates  commercial success of our products and product candidates and other factors described under the caption risk factors elsewhere in this form k 
we expect to generate royalty revenue on elestat in the first quarter of and restasis royalty revenue in the second quarter of  but do not expect this revenue to exceed our operating expenses 
as part of our drug development strategy  we outsource significant amounts of our preclinical and clinical programs and the manufacture of drug substance used in those programs 
accordingly  we have entered into contractual commitments or purchase arrangements with various clinical research organizations  manufacturers of active pharmaceutical ingredients and drug product and others 
the amount of our financial commitments under these arrangements totaled approximately million at december  in addition  we have other contractual commitments outside of drug development under arrangements which totaled approximately million at december  these amounts may vary dependent upon the results of underlying studies  the completion of studies and or projects and certain other variable components that may yield a result that differs from management s estimate 
also  at december   we have future contractual commitments to pay million of lease obligations for our administrative offices  laboratory facilities and equipment  and  of corporate debt obligations 
our existing license  collaboration and sponsored research agreements may require future cash payments 
in the aggregate  these agreements may require payments of up to million assuming the achievement of all development milestones  up to million assuming the achievement of all sales milestones and up to  assuming the achievement of all research milestones 
amounts payable by us under these agreements are uncertain and are contingent on a number of factors  including the progress of our discovery and drug development programs  our ability to obtain regulatory approvals  and the commercial success of our approved products 
additionally  we are obligated to pay royalties on net sales  if any  of certain product candidates currently in our portfolio 
some of our license agreements require minimum annual license preservation fees under our existing license agreements ranging from  to  in addition  if we obtain licenses on additional product candidates in the future  or if our collaborative arrangements identify additional product candidates  our license obligations would increase 
subject to the information and qualifications included in the above paragraph  as of december   our contractual obligations are as follows in thousands contractual and potential obligations payment due by period total less than year years years more than years debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations minimum annual payments research milestone obligations development milestone obligations sales milestone obligations total impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity we are subject to interest rate risk on our investment portfolio 
we maintain an investment portfolio consisting primarily of high quality money market instruments and government obligations 
our portfolio has a current average maturity of less than months 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to the increase or decrease in the amount of interest income we can earn on our investment portfolio  changes in the market value of investments due to changes in interest rates  the increase or decrease in realized gains and losses on investments and the amount of interest expense we must pay with respect to various outstanding debt instruments 
our risk associated with fluctuating interest expense is limited to capital leases and other short term debt obligations 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
we ensure the safety and preservation of invested principal funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
we reduce default risk by investing in investment grade securities 
our investment portfolio includes only marketable securities and instruments with active secondary or resale markets to help insure portfolio liquidity and we have implemented guidelines limiting the duration of investments 
a hypothetical basis point drop in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not significantly affect the fair value of our interest sensitive financial instruments 
at december   our portfolio of available for sale investments consisted of approximately million of investments maturing within one year and approximately million of investments maturing after one year but within months 
in addition  we have million of our long term investments that are held in a restricted account that collateralizes a letter of credit with a financial institution 
additionally  we generally have the ability to hold our fixed income investments to maturity and therefore do not expect that our operating results  financial position or cash flows will be affected by a significant amount due to a sudden change in interest rates 
strategic investment risk in addition to our normal investment portfolio  we have a strategic investment in parion sciences  inc valued at million 
this investment represents unregistered preferred stock and is subject to higher investment risk than our normal investment portfolio due to the lack of an active resale market for the investment
