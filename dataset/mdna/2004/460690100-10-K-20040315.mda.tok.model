outlook the company s results of operations are dependent upon a maintaining and growing its revenue  b the ability to retain and gain new clients  c the continuous alignment of its costs to its revenue and d retaining and attracting key personnel 
revenue is also highly dependent on overall economic and political conditions 
for a discussion of these and other factors that could affect the company s results of operations and financial conditions  see statement regarding forward looking disclosure and business risk factors 
as discussed above  was a difficult year for the company  reflecting continued softness in worldwide demand for advertising and marketing communications services 
the decline in organic revenue versus the prior year was a decline of for the full year 
however  the company noted a positive trend in its revenues during the latter part of  particularly internationally 
there was sequential improvement throughout the year as the organic revenue decline was in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter of  in each case versus the prior year 
while management expects continued progress overall in the company s organic revenue trends  it does not expect that the progression will be linear  in particular given the cyclical nature of the company s business 
industry forecasters expect that there will continue to be signs of improving economic activity  on a worldwide basis  in specifically  worldwide advertising and marketing services spending is expected to rise by 
such a forecast confirms that  while there is no certainty as to what will ultimately occur  economic conditions in should continue to be better than for the industry as a whole 
the company s performance in the recent past has lagged  somewhat  that of the industry and may continue to do so 
management has responded to its recent performance issues  however  by implementing a turnaround program 
the program was begun in mid and is targeted to be complete by mid the first stage of the program has focused on implementing the restructuring initiatives discussed below and improving the company s capital structure 
going forward the turnaround program will focus on achieving certain defined performance objectives based on the company s perceived peer competitor performance levels 
the objectives include those relating to achieving organic revenue growth comparable to the company s peer competitors  by building on the collaboration and supplemental incentive plan and changing the company s culture  improving the company s operating margin  by reducing staff costs and office and general costs  including further property consolidation  and continuing to manage the company s debt to capital ratio  building on actions taken to date  and improving its debt to profitability and its interest coverage ratio 
results of operations the company reports its financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
when comparing performance between years  however  the company also discusses non gaap financial measures such as the impact that foreign currency rate changes  acquisitions dispositions and organic growth have on reported results 
the interpublic group of companies  inc 
and its subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollars in millions  except per share amounts the company derives organic revenue by adjusting reported revenue in respect of any given period by excluding the impact of foreign currency effects over the course of the period to provide revenues on a constant currency basis  and excluding the impact on reported revenue resulting from acquisitions and dispositions that were consummated after the first day of the year prior to the given period 
additionally  organic revenue calculations for the year ended  and each quarter of  have been adjusted to make organic revenue principally arising from public relations and sporting event arrangements more directly comparable to organic revenue arising from public relations and sporting event arrangements in periods preceding january   and for the impact of the deconsolidation of certain international entities 
if these adjustments had been made to revenue for prior periods  there would have been neither a material effect on results in prior periods nor any effect whatsoever on operating or net income 
these adjustments principally relate to grossing up revenues and expenses by the same amount in connection with the reimbursement of certain out of pocket expenses relating to public relations and sporting event arrangements 
management believes that discussing organic revenue  giving effect to the above factors  provides a better understanding of the company s revenue performance and trends than reported revenue because it allows for more meaningful comparisons of current period revenue to that of prior periods 
management also believes that organic revenue determined on a generally comparable basis is a common measure of performance in the businesses in which it operates 
when the company discusses amounts on a constant currency basis  the prior period results are adjusted to remove the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates during the current period that is being compared to the prior period 
the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on prior period results is removed by converting the prior period results into us dollars at the average exchange rate for the current period 
management believes that discussing results on a constant currency basis allows for a more meaningful comparison of current period results to such prior period results 
the company has also highlighted the impact of the loss of the chrysler account in the fourth quarter of revenue and operating expenses related to which continued through 
chrysler was a major client of true north communications  inc true north  which the company acquired in a transaction accounted for as a pooling of interests in june as a result of the acquisition of true north  the company lost accounts of pepsi owned brands due to client conflicts within the combined company 
management believes that adjusting for the impact of these significant client losses is relevant when comparing organic revenue performance between and as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company is comprised of two reportable segments the interpublic sports and entertainment group seg and interpublic excluding seg 
seg was formed during the second quarter of through a carve out from the company s other operating groups and is primarily comprised of the operations of oww  for the company s sports marketing business  motorsports  for the company s motorsports business  and jack morton worldwide  for specialized marketing services including corporate events  meeting and training learning 
seg revenue is not material to the company as a whole 
however  due to the recording of long lived asset impairment charges  operating difficulties and resulting higher costs principally from its motorsports business  seg has incurred significant operating losses 
based on certain substantial contractual obligations and revised projections for oww  the company does not expect that margins of seg will converge with those of the rest of the company and  accordingly  reports seg as a separate reportable segment 
other than the impairment charges which are discussed below and the commitments discussed in other matters  the operating results of seg are not material to those of the company  and therefore are not discussed in detail below

under the terms of the proposed settlement  the company will pay  of which will be paid in cash and will be paid in shares of the company s common stock at an estimated value of per share which translates into  shares 
in the event that the price of the company s common stock falls below per share before final approval of the settlement  the company will either  at its sole discretion  issue additional shares of common stock or pay cash so that the consideration for the stock portion of the settlement will have a total value of the ultimate amount of the litigation charge related to the settlement will depend upon the company s stock price at the ti me a settlement is concluded

other items effective income tax rate the company s effective income tax rate was an expense of in  an expense of in and a benefit of in the company s effective income tax rate for  and was negatively impacted by the restructuring charges  non deductible long lived asset impairment charges and non deductible investment impairment charges relating to unconsolidated affiliates 
in addition  the tax rate in was negatively impacted by the establishment of valuation allowances on certain deferred tax assets as well as losses incurred in non us jurisdictions with tax benefits at rates lower than the us statutory rates 
the difference between the effective tax rate and the statutory federal rate of is also due to state and local taxes and the effect of non us operations 
all of these factors contributed to the company s recording of a tax provision of on a pre tax loss of for the increased tax rate in reflects a higher proportion of earnings derived from the us where it is taxed at higher rates  as well as losses incurred in non us jurisdictions with tax benefits at rates lower than the us statutory rates 
the difference between the and effective tax rates is primarily attributable to the elimination of certain non deductible accounting charges resulting from our adoption of sfas see note 
the effective income tax rate reflects the impact of goodwill amortization 
valuation allowance as required by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas  the company is required to evaluate on a quarterly basis the realizability of its deferred tax assets 
sfas requires a valuation allowance be established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in circumstances where there is sufficient negative evidence  establishment of a valuation allowance must be considered 
the company believes that cumulative losses in the most recent three year period represent sufficient negative evidence under the provisions of sfas and  as a result  the company determined that certain of its deferred tax assets required the establishment of a valuation allowance 
the deferred tax assets for which an allowance was established relate primarily to foreign net operating and us capital loss carryforwards 
during  a valuation allowance of was established in continuing operations on existing defe rred tax assets 
in addition  of valuation allowances were established in continuing operations for current year losses incurred in jurisdictions where a benefit is not currently expected  and of valuation allowances were established in continuing operations for certain us capital and other loss carryforwards 
the total valuation allowance as of december  was the interpublic group of companies  inc 
and its subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollars in millions  except per share amounts the realization of the remaining deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on forecasted future taxable income 
any reduction in estimated forecasted future taxable income  including but not limited to any future restructuring activities may require that we record additional valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets on which a valuation allowance has not previously been established 
the valuation allowance that has been established will be maintained until there is sufficient positive evidence to conclude that it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized 
an ongoing pattern of profitability will generally be considered as sufficient positive evidence 
our income tax expense recorded in the future will be reduced to the extent of offsetting decreases in our valuation allowance 
the establishment or reversal of valuation allowances could have a significant negative or positive impact on future earnings

the company s revolving credit facilities are an essential part of its liquidity profile 
the new day revolving credit facility expires on may  if the lenders fail to extend their commitments by the renewal date  there could be an adverse affect on the company s liquidity 
further  if the company were to lose all or a substantial portion of its uncommitted lines of credit  it would be forced to seek other sources of liquidity 
in the event that additional funds are required or in the event that the revolving credit facilities or uncommitted lines of credit are not extended  the company believes it will have sufficient resources through cash on hand and its ability to access other debt markets  and through its ability to access the equity markets to meet such requirements 
however  there can be no assurance that such additional funding will be available to the company on terms it considers favorable  if at all 
in addition  unanticipated decreases in operating results and the concomitant decrease in cash flows from operations as a result of decreased demand for the company s services or from other developments might require the company to seek modification of its current debt agreements and to seek other sources of liquidity including the disposition of certain assets and to modify its operating strategies 
a downgrade in ratings by any of the ratings agencies may trigger a right on the part of the holders of the notes to convert the notes into shares of the company s common stock 
in addition  such an event might adversely affect the company s ability to access capital  would result in an increase in the interest rates payable under the revolving credit facilities and would likely result in an increase in the interest rate payable under any future indebtedness

of these policies  the company believes the following accounting policies are critical because they are both important to the presentation of the company s financial condition and results and they require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to estimate the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on other factors that it considers reasonable under the circumstances

revenue recognition the company derives revenue from advertising services  including media buying  and from marketing and communication services  including market research  public relations  direct marketing  sales promotion and event marketing activities 
the company s advertising services revenue is derived from commissions that are earned when the media is placed  from fees earned as advertising services are performed and from production services rendered 
in addition  incentive amounts may be earned based on qualitative and or quantitative criteria 
in the case of commissions  revenue is recognized as the media placements appear 
in the case of fee and production arrangements  the revenue is recognized as the services are performed which is generally ratably over the period of the client contract 
the company s marketing service revenues are generally earned on a fee basis  and in certain cases incentive amounts may also be earned 
as with fee arrangements in advertising  such revenue is recognized as the work is performed 
incentive amounts for advertising and marketing services are recognized upon satisfaction of the qualitative and or quantitative criteria  as set out in the relevant client contract 
in many cases  the amount the company bills to clients significantly exceeds the amount of revenues that is earned due to the existence of various pass through charges such as the cost of media 
in compliance with emerging issues task force pronouncement eitf  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent and eitf  income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred  the company generally records revenue net of pass through charges as it is not the primary obligor with respect to the cost of pass through charges and generally acts as an agent on behalf of its clients with respect to such costs 
expenditures billable to clients include costs incurred primarily in connection with production work by the company on behalf of clients that have not yet been billed to clients 
commissions and fees on such production work are recorded as revenue when earned 
as of december   the amount of expenditures billable to clients was allowance for doubtful accounts the company assesses the required amount of allowance for doubtful accounts based on past experience and reviews of aging and analysis of specific accounts 
the aging of accounts receivable  reviews of client credit reports  industry trends and economic indicators  as well as analysis of recent payment history for selected customers  enables the company to estimate the expected bad debt experience related to receivables at each period end 
the estimate is based largely on a formula driven calculation but is supplemented with economic indicators and specific knowledge of potential write offs in client accounts 
in  the company recorded a lower amount of bad debt expense than in the prior year reflecting improved experience with collections and as compared to the prior year in which there were larger specific write offs 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing its consolidated financial statements  the company is required to estimate income taxes payable in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
this process involves estimating the actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the company s consolidated balance sheet 
the interpublic group of companies  inc 
and its subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollars in millions  except per share amounts sfas requires a valuation allowance be established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in circumstances where there is sufficient negative evidence  establishment of a valuation allowance must be considered 
the company believes that cumulative losses in the most recent three year period represent sufficient negative evidence to consider a valuation allowance under the provisions of sfas as a result  the company determined that certain of its deferred tax assets required the establishment of a valuation allowance 
the deferred tax assets for which an allowance was established relate primarily to foreign net operating and us capital loss carryforwards 
during  a valuation allowance of was established in continuing operations on existing deferred tax assets 
in addition  of valuation allowances were established in continuing operations for current year losses incurred in jurisdictions where a benefit is not current ly expected  and of valuation allowances were established in continuing operations for certain us capital and other loss carryforwards 
the realization of the remaining deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on forecasted future taxable income 
any reduction in estimated forecasted future taxable income  including but not limited to any future restructuring activities may require that we record additional valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets on which a valuation allowance has not previously been established 
the valuation allowance that has been established will be maintained until there is sufficient positive evidence to conclude that it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized 
an ongoing pattern of profitability will generally be considered as sufficient positive evidence 
our income tax expense recorded in the future will be reduced to the extent of offsetting decreases in our valuation allowance 
the establishment and reversal of valuation allowances could have a significant negative or positive impact on our future earnings 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and investments the company has a significant amount of long lived assets  including fixed assets  investments  goodwill and other intangibles 
the company periodically evaluates the realizability of all of its long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicated that the carrying value of an asset might not be recoverable 
goodwill in the third quarter of each year as of september the company formally evaluates the realizability of its goodwill and other intangibles  using discounted cash flow projections 
the company has used the september date since the adoption of sfas such projections require the use of estimates and assumptions as to matters such as future revenue growth  product margins  capital expenditures  assumed tax rates and discount rates 
such projections are prepared for each reporting unit as defined in sfas management believes that the estimates and assumptions made are reasonable 
to the extent that the company has incorrectly estimated the revenue growth and or product margin assumptions in the calculations  the goodwill related to certain reporting units may be determined to be unrealizable and an impairment charge may have to be recorded 
the company believes that the accounting estimates relating to potential goodwill and other intangible impairments are a critical accounting estimate because i they are susceptible to change from period to period and ii they require the company to make assumptions about future forecast growth rates 
in and  as a result of the impairment analyses conducted above  total charges related to goodwill impairment of and  respectively  were recorded in the income statement 
this was due to the fact that expectations for future earnings from the oww and motorsports reporting units would not be sufficient to recover any of the goodwill of the reporting unit 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
investments the company regularly reviews its cost and equity investments  where market value has declined below cost  to determine whether there has been an other than temporary decline in market value 
for investments accounted for using the cost or equity method of accounting  management evaluates information eg  budgets  business plans  financial statements  etc 
in addition to quoted market price  if any  in determining whether an other than temporary decline in value exists 
factors indicative of an other than temporary decline include recurring operating losses  credit defaults and subsequent rounds of financings at an amount below the cost basis of the investment 
this list is not all inclusive and management weighs all known quantitative and qualitative factors in determining if an other than temporary decline in value of an investment has occurred

and its subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollars in millions  except per share amounts the company recorded non cash impairment charges of  and in  and  respectively 
the company considers that future impairment charges may be necessary based on the factors above  but anticipates that these would not be as significant as in prior years 
fixed assets for fixed assets  accounting standards require that if the sum of the future cash flows expected to result from a company s asset grouping  undiscounted and without interest charges  is less than the reported value of the asset  an asset impairment must be recognized in the financial statements 
the amount of the impairment recognized is calculated by subtracting the imputed fair value  as calculated above  from the reported value of the asset 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  there were significant long lived assets held at motorsports 
the remaining assets as of december  were sold in a transaction that occurred in january an impairment charge of was recorded in to reduce the company value of these assets to their realizable value 
future events could cause the company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that the asset values associated with a given operation have become impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material impact on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
accounting for business combinations the company accounts for its business acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting 
the total cost of acquisitions is allocated to the underlying net assets  based on their respective estimated fair market values 
goodwill is recorded as the difference between the cost of acquiring an entity and the estimated fair market values assigned to its tangible and identifiable intangible net assets at the date of acquisition 
determining the fair market value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management s judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions  including  among others  assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows  discount rates  asset lives  and market multiples  among other items 
the company has significant future deferred payments earn outs that generally tie the aggregate price ultimately paid for an acquisition to its performance over a period of time 
such payments are recorded within the financial statements once the payment of such earn outs is probable and estimable  and when any contractual contingencies have been met 
the company has policies and procedures in place to determine if such payments relate to the acquisition  and should be allocated to the assets and liabilities acquired  or should be expensed as compensation payments 
these policies include reviewing the acquisition agreements and employment terms of former owners of the acquired businesses 
the total amount that is anticipated to be settled  in cash and stock  is estimated to be  of which relates to payments due in the actual amounts to be paid are contingent upon the achievement of projected operating performance targets generally over a three or four year period and satisfying other conditions as specified in the relevant agreements 
other matters sec investigation the company was informed in january by the securities and exchange commission staff that the sec has issued a formal order of investigation related to the company s restatements of earnings for periods dating back to the matters had previously been the subject of an informal inquiry

as of december   the company is committed to remaining payments under these arrangements of approximately this amount relates to undiscounted payments through principally under an executory contract and an operating lease and assumes payments over the maximum remaining term of the relevant agreements 
this estimated amount has not been reduced by any future revenues to be generated from the arrangements 
the company is continuing to explore various options with respect to these commitments  at least one of which may involve a cash disbursement in the order of the company has obtained amendments of the interpublic group of companies  inc 
and its subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollars in millions  except per share amounts certain definitions contained in its revolving credit agreements as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements to reduce the impact of such cash disbursement and the resulting accounting charge on its financial covenant calculations

the interpublic group of companies  inc 
and its subsidiaries dollars in millions  except per share amounts item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk related to interest rates and foreign currencies 
interest rates at december   a significant portion of the company s debt obligations were at fixed interest rates 
accordingly  assuming the fixed rate debt is not refinanced  there would be no impact on interest expense or cash flow from either a increase or decrease in market rates of interest 
the fair market value of the debt obligations would decrease by if market rates were to increase by and would increase by if market rates were to decrease by 
for that portion of the debt that is maintained at variable rates  based on amounts and rates outstanding at december   the change in interest expense and cash flow from a change in rates would be negligible 
foreign currencies the company faces two risks related to foreign currency exchange translation risk and transaction risk 
amounts invested in the company s foreign operations are translated into us dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date 
the resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the stockholders equity section of the balance sheet 
the company s foreign subsidiaries generally collect revenues and pay expenses in currencies other than the us dollar 
since the functional currency of the company s foreign operations is generally the local currency  foreign currency translation of the balance sheet is reflected as a component of stockholders equity and does not impact operating results 
revenues and expenses in foreign currencies translate into varying amounts of us dollars depending upon whether the us dollar weakens or strengthens against other currencies 
therefore  changes in exchange rates may negatively affect the compa ny s consolidated revenues and expenses as expressed in us dollars from foreign operations 
currency transaction gains or losses arising from transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are included in results of operations and were not significant in  and the company has not entered into a material amount of foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates
