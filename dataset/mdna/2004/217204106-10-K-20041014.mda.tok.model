overview we provide vehicle suppliers  primarily insurance companies  with a full range of services to process and sell salvage vehicles through auctions  principally to licensed vehicle dismantlers  rebuilders  repair licensees  used vehicle dealers and exporters 
salvage vehicles are either damaged vehicles deemed a total loss for insurance or business purposes or are recovered stolen vehicles for which an insurance settlement with the vehicle owner has already been made 
we offer vehicle suppliers a full range of services that expedite each stage of the salvage vehicle auction process and minimize administrative and processing costs 
we generate revenues primarily from auction fees paid by vehicle suppliers and vehicle buyers as well as related fees for services such as towing and storage 
we process salvage vehicles principally on a consignment method  on either the percentage incentive program pip or on a fixed fee consignment basis 
using either consignment method  only the fees associated with vehicle processing are recorded in revenue 
for the fiscal years ended july   and  approximately  and of the vehicles we sold  respectively  were processed under pip 
we attempt to convert vehicle supplier agreements at acquired operations to pip  which typically results in higher net returns to vehicle suppliers and higher fees to us than standard fixed fee consignment programs 
those vehicles not sold under the pip program were processed under fixed fee agreements 
due to a number of factors  including the timing and size of new acquisitions  market conditions  and acceptance of pip by vehicle suppliers  the percentage of vehicles processed under these programs in future periods may vary 
our revenues consist of salvage fees charged to vehicle suppliers and vehicle buyers  transportation revenue and purchased vehicle revenues 
salvage fees from vehicle suppliers include fees under pip agreements and fixed fee programs where we charge for title processing  special preparation  storage and selling 
salvage fees also include fees charged to vehicle buyers for purchasing vehicles  storage and annual registration 
transportation revenue includes charges to suppliers for towing vehicles under fixed fee contracts 
transportation revenue also includes towing charges 
table of contents assessed to buyers for delivering vehicles 
purchased vehicle revenues are comprised of the price that buyers paid at our auctions for vehicles processed that we own 
costs attributable to yard and fleet expenses consist primarily of operating personnel which includes yard management  clerical and yard employees  rent  contract vehicle towing  insurance  fuel  fleet maintenance and repair  and costs of vehicles we sold under purchase contracts 
costs associated with general and administrative expenses consist primarily of executive  accounting and data processing  sales personnel  human resources  professional fees and marketing expenses 
during fiscal  we converted all of our salvage vehicle auction facilities to an internet based auction style model using our virtual bidding second generation vb internet sales technology 
this second generation technology combines two bidding processes 
an open preliminary bidding feature allows a buyer to enter bids either at a bidding station at the auction facility during the three preview days or over the internet 
to improve the effectiveness of bidding  the vb system lets a buyer see the current high bid on the vehicle they want to purchase 
the preliminary bidding phase is an open sales format 
buyers enter the maximum price they are willing to pay for a vehicle and bidu will incrementally bid the vehicle on their behalf 
preliminary bidding ends one hour prior to the start of an internet only virtual sale 
bidu will represent the high preliminary bidder at the internet only virtual sale 
this feature allows bidders the opportunity to bid against each other and the high preliminary bidder 
the bidders enter bids via the internet in a real time format 
bidu submits bids for the high preliminary bidder  up to their maximum bid 
when bidding stops  a countdown is initiated 
if no bids are received during the countdown  the vehicle sells to the highest bidder 
vb opens our sales process to registered buyers anywhere in the world who have internet access 
we believe the implementation of vb across our salvage operations has increased the pool of available buyers for each sale and the added competition has increased the amount buyers are willing to pay for salvage from us 
it has also improved the efficiency of our operations 
for fiscal  sales of vehicles to buyers outside the state where the vehicle is located accounted for of total vehicles sold  of salvage vehicles were sold to out of state buyers and were sold to buyers out of country 
the period to period comparability of our operating results and financial condition is substantially affected by business acquisitions and new openings made by us during such periods 
acquisitions and new operations we have experienced significant growth as we have acquired twelve vehicle auction facilities and established twelve new facilities since the beginning of fiscal all of these acquisitions have been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
as part of our overall expansion strategy of offering integrated service to vehicle suppliers  we anticipate acquiring and developing facilities in new regions  as well as the regions currently served by our facilities 
as part of this strategy  in fiscal we acquired new facilities in or near eugene  oregon  cleveland  ohio and anchorage  alaska and opened new facilities in or near toronto  canada and helena  montana 
in fiscal  we acquired new facilities in or near pittsburgh  pennsylvania  reno  nevada and richmond  virginia and opened new facilities in or near springfield  missouri  corpus christi  texas  ft 
pierce  florida  rancho cucamonga  california  richmond  virginia and albany  new york 
in fiscal  we acquired new facilities in or near new castle  delaware  savannah  georgia  tifton  georgia  charleston  west virginia  haslet  texas and greencastle  pennsylvania and opened new facilities in or near lyman  
table of contents maine  tucson  arizona  somerville  new jersey and amarillo  texas 
we believe that these acquisitions and openings strengthen our coverage as we have facilities located in north america and are able to provide national coverage for our suppliers 
we seek to increase revenues and profitability by  among other things  i acquiring and developing new salvage vehicle auction facilities in key markets  ii pursuing national and regional vehicle supply agreements  iii expanding our service offerings to suppliers and buyers  iv increasing revenue and profitability at our public automobile auction facilities and v expanding the application of vb into new markets 
in addition  we implement our pricing structure and merchandising procedures and attempt to effect cost efficiencies at each of our acquired facilities by implementing our operational procedures  integrating our management information systems and redeploying personnel  when necessary 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to vehicle pooling costs  allowance for doubtful accounts  goodwill  income taxes and long lived assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we defer  in vehicle pooling costs  certain yard and fleet expenses associated with vehicles consigned to and received by us but not sold as of the balance sheet date 
we quantify the deferred costs using a calculation that includes the number of vehicles at our facilities at the beginning and end of the period  the number of vehicles sold during the period and an allocation of certain yard and fleet expenses of the period 
the primary expenses allocated and deferred are certain facility costs  labor  transportation  and vehicle processing 
if our allocation factors change  then yard and fleet expenses could increase or decrease correspondingly in the future 
these costs are expensed as vehicles are sold in the subsequent periods on an average cost basis 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts in order to provide for estimated losses resulting from disputed amounts billed to suppliers or buyers and the inability of our suppliers or buyers to make required payments 
if billing disputes exceed expectations and or if the financial condition of our suppliers or buyers were to deteriorate  additional allowances may be required 
we evaluate separately the impairment of goodwill of our salvage and our public auction operating segments  annually by comparing the fair value of the operating segment to its carrying value 
in prior years  we evaluated impairment of goodwill at the facility level by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value 
during fiscal  when we centralized the auction process with the implementation of vb  we determined the appropriate level for testing for impairment was at the salvage and public auction levels 
under this accounting policy  we have not recognized any charges for the impairment of goodwill in previous years or the current year 
future adverse changes in 
table of contents market conditions or poor operating results of an operating segment could result in an inability to recover the carrying value of the investment  thereby requiring an impairment charge in the future 
we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis 
generally accepted accounting principles require the assessment of the company s performance and other relevant factors when determining the need for a valuation allowance with respect to these deferred tax assets 
the company s ability to realize deferred tax assets is dependent on its ability to generate future taxable income 
accordingly  the company has established a valuation allowance when  in certain taxable jurisdictions  the utilization of the tax asset is uncertain 
additional timing differences  future earning trends and or tax strategies may occur which could warrant a need for establishing an additional valuation allowance or a reserve 
we are also required to estimate income tax provisions and amounts ultimately payable or recoverable in numerous jurisdictions 
such estimates involve significant interpretations of regulations and are inherently very complex 
resolution of income tax treatments in individual jurisdictions may not be known for many years after completion of any fiscal year 
we evaluate long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows change in the future  we may be required to reduce the carrying amount of an asset in the future 
we are partially self insured for certain losses related to general liability  workers compensation and auto liability 
our liability represents an estimate of the ultimate cost of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date 
the estimated liability is not discounted and is established based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates 
while we believe these estimates are reasonable based on the information currently available  if actual trends  including the severity of claims and medical cost inflation  differ from our estimates  our results of operations could be impacted 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated below  certain information derived from our consolidated statements of income expressed as a percentage of revenues 
there can be no assurance that any trend in operating results will continue in the future 
fiscal years ended july  revenues operating expenses yard and fleet general and administrative depreciation and amortization total operating expenses operating income other income  net income before income taxes income taxes net income fiscal compared to fiscal revenues were approximately million during fiscal  an increase of approximately million  or  over fiscal the increase was due primarily to increased salvage vehicle volume  new service revenue and higher fees resulting from increased auction proceeds per vehicle

table of contents depreciation and amortization expense was approximately million during fiscal  an increase of approximately million  or  over fiscal this increase was due primarily to depreciation and amortization of capital expenditures and covenants not to compete and depreciation of acquired assets resulting from the acquisition of new auction facilities 
growth in capital spending in fiscal and prior periods is expected to result in increased depreciation and amortization expense in future periods

cash and cash equivalents increased by approximately million in fiscal and decreased by approximately million in fiscal our liquidity and capital resources have not been materially affected by inflation 
during the winter months  most of our facilities process to more vehicles than at other times of the year 
this increased seasonal volume requires the increased use of our cash to pay out advances and handling costs of the additional business 
as of july   we had working capital of approximately million  including cash and cash equivalents of approximately million 
our primary source of cash is from the collection of sellers fees  buyers fees and reimbursable advances from the proceeds of auctioned salvage vehicles 
we believe that our currently available cash  cash generated from operations and borrowing availability under our bank credit facilities and equipment leasing lines will be sufficient to satisfy our operating and working capital requirements for at least the next months 
however  if we experience significant growth in the future  we may be required to raise additional cash through the issuance of new debt or additional equity 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities increased by million from fiscal to million in fiscal  due to the timing of routine changes in working capital items and profitability of the company 
investing activities capital expenditures excluding those associated with fixed assets attributable to acquisitions were approximately million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively
