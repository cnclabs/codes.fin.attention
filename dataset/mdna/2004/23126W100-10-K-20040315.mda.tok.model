critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  bad debts  inventories  income taxes and intangibles 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
specialty pharmacy services revenues are recognized  net of any contractual allowances  when the product is shipped to a patient  retail pharmacy or a physician s office  or when the service is provided 
specialty healthcare services revenues are recognized after the management services are rendered and are billed monthly in arrears 
trade receivables 
considerable judgment is required in assessing the ultimate realization of receivables  including the current financial condition of the customer  age of the receivable and the relationship with the customer 
the company estimates its allowances for doubtful accounts using these factors 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
in circumstances where the company is aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations eg  bankruptcy filings  a specific reserve for bad debts is recorded against amounts due to reduce the receivable to the amount the company reasonably believes will be collected 
for all other customers  the company has reserves for bad debt based upon the total accounts receivable balance 
at december   the company s reserve for accounts receivable was approximately of total receivables 
inventories 
inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market on a first in  first out basis 
inventories consist of high cost biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical products that  in many cases  require refrigeration or other special handling 
as a result  inventories are subject to spoilage or shrinkage 
on a quarterly basis  the company performs a physical inventory and determines whether any shrinkage or spoilage adjustments are needed 
although the company believes its inventories balances at december  are reasonably accurate  there can be no assurances that spoilage or shrinkage adjustments will not be needed in the future 
the recording of any such reserve may have a negative impact on the company s operating results 
deferred taxes 
the company had approximately million in net deferred tax assets at december  to record against future taxable income and approximately million in deferred tax liabilities 
the company does not have a valuation allowance against its assets as it believes it is more likely than not that the tax assets will be realized 
the company has considered future income expectations and prudent tax strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
in the event the company determines in the future that it needs to record a valuation allowance  an adjustment to deferred tax assets would be charged against income in the period of determination 
goodwill and intangibles 
goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired 
intangibles consist of the separately identifiable intangibles  such as pharmacy and customer relationships and covenants not to compete 
effective january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which requires goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives no longer be amortized but rather be reviewed annually  or more frequently if impairment indicators arise  for impairment 
separable intangible assets that are not deemed to have an indefinite life will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
in assessing the recoverability of the company s goodwill and intangibles  the company must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or assumptions change in the future  the company may need to record an impairment charge for these assets 
an impairment charge would reduce operating income in the period it was determined that the charge was needed
