item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis together with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this annual report 
the following information contains forward looking statements  which are subject to risks and uncertainties 
should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ from those expressed or implied by the forward looking statements 
see cautionary statements 
general we provide marine construction services for the offshore oil and gas industry in the us gulf of mexico  northeastern us  latin america  southeast asia and west africa  and have recently expanded our operations to the middle east 
we have eleven vessels in our marine fleet that are currently operational 
the primary services we provide include installing pipelines  providing pipebury  hook up and commissioning services  
table of contents installing production platforms and other structures  disassembling and salvaging production platforms and other structures  and performing pipe spooling services 
the demand for offshore construction services depends largely on the condition of the oil and gas industry and  in particular  the level of capital expenditures by oil and gas companies for developmental construction 
these expenditures are influenced by the price of oil and gas and industry perception of future prices  the ability of the oil and gas industry to access capital  expectations about future demand and prices  the cost of exploring for  producing and developing oil and gas reserves  sale and expiration dates of offshore leases in the united states and abroad  discovery rates of new oil and gas reserves in offshore areas  local and international political and economic conditions  governmental regulations  and the availability and cost of capital 
historically  oil and gas prices and the level of exploration and development activity have fluctuated substantially  impacting the demand for pipeline and marine construction services 
factors affecting our profitability include competition  equipment and labor productivity  contract estimating  weather conditions and other risks inherent in marine construction 
the marine construction industry in the us gulf of mexico and offshore mexico is highly seasonal as a result of weather conditions with the greatest demand for these services occurring during the second and third calendar quarters of the year 
international areas offshore southeast asia and west africa are less cyclical and are not impacted seasonally to the degree the us gulf of mexico and offshore mexico is impacted 
overview we have had two years of operating losses  and as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we reported operating losses of million and million for and  respectively 
the operating loss for includes a million reserve for unapproved claims from pemex and a million impairment loss on the phoenix horizon  two diving support vessels  one small construction vessel  a cargo barge and related marine equipment 
we had negative cash flows from operations of million for our negative cash flows from operations and the inability to collect receivables and claims from pemex  iroquois and williams severely impacted our liquidity during  requiring us to obtain additional financing and amend our existing debt covenants 
during the second quarter of  we secured million in secured asset based financing from three lenders  including a million term loan from elliott associates 
in march  we issued million of subordinated notes to meet immediate working capital needs 
we believe that with the issuance of the subordinated notes  cash provided by operations and available liquidity will be sufficient to fund our debt service requirements  working capital and vessel maintenance until at least december  had we not been able to secure the additional financing and successfully amend loan covenants on existing debt  we would not have had sufficient cash to fund operating requirements 
during  revenues related to our pipeline installation and burial project in the northeastern us for iroquois accounted for of our consolidated revenues 
our liquidity has been impacted by the delay in collecting approximately million of receivables from iroquois for the performance of this project 
construction activities under our contract for this project were completed during october we also completed a pipeline inspection and pipetrenching project in the northeastern us during the third quarter of  which accounted for of our consolidated revenues during additionally  operations in the southeast asia region contributed significant revenues during  accounting for of our consolidated revenues 
work on a structural and pipeline installation project in brunei was completed during the third quarter of and construction activities on a pipeline and structural installation project in malaysia were completed in the fourth quarter of in the us gulf of mexico  work on an mile pipeline installation and burial project accounted for of our consolidated revenues for the demand for offshore construction services depends largely on the condition of the oil and gas industry and  in particular  the level of capital expenditures by oil and gas companies for developmental construction 
capital expenditures by oil and gas companies operating in the u 
s 
gulf of mexico remained at reduced levels during due to the slow down in the u 
s 
economy and concerns over us natural gas pricing trends 
the resulting competitive market conditions in response to lower levels of developmental construction have decreased vessel utilization and profit margins in the us gulf of mexico and offshore mexico and adversely affected our revenues and profitability 
in general  our profit margins for marine construction have declined over the past five years 
also  lower margins on projects in the northeastern us  downtime on vessels operating in the northern us gulf of mexico because of unanticipated inclement weather conditions  and schedule slippage in several major projects in the us gulf of mexico and west africa contributed to a decrease in gross profit for in late march  our customer in nigeria temporarily suspended operations of our two year pipeline and structural installation program due to ethnic unrest in the niger delta 
due to the temporary suspension of operations followed by the adverse weather season in this region from may through september  our work on this project did not resume until late october  which negatively impacted revenues and gross profit during the second and third quarters of we continue to negotiate with and use our best efforts to resolve our epc contract claims against pemex 
we previously anticipated that these claims would be resolved by the end of the fourth quarter of during the fourth quarter of  however  since there was no final resolution of these claims and the ultimate amount and timing of payment of these claims was uncertain  we recorded a million reserve for unapproved claims from pemex 
cumulative revenues recognized from through on all pemex projects in mexico totaled million  including million of claims made under three pemex contracts for extra work related to interferences  interruptions and other delays 
of the million of claims  million related to our second major project for pemex  epc  of which we have collected million 
the remaining million of claims related to two more recent projects for pemex and have been collected in full 
these two more recent projects were performed subsequent to the epc contract under the current senior management at pemex 
unapproved claims related to the pemex projects arise primarily from client delays and changes in the initial scope of work 
a summary of the balance of claims remaining in costs in excess of billings related to the pemex projects are as follows in millions claims included in revenue claims included in revenue total claims claims billed to pemex in claims included in costs in excess of billings as of december  claims billed to pemex in reserve for claims in claims included in costs in excess of billings as of december  there were no claims related to pemex included in revenues for the year ended december  if we are unsuccessful in resolving our outstanding epc contract claims against pemex  we intend to submit some or all of the claims to arbitration in mexico in accordance with the rules of arbitration of the international chamber of commerce 
the carrying value of our uncollected receivables remaining from december  of approximately million  which includes million of unapproved claims and million of additional scope of work  is our best estimate of the amount we believe will be collected 
in march  we were awarded a contract for approximately million with the israel electric corporation for the installation of a diameter natural gas transmission system pipeline 
the project calls for the transportation  installation  burial and precommissioning of approximately km of pipeline with landfalls at three locations  along with a lateral km of diameter pipeline 
the project also calls for the landfalls to be installed by horizontal directional drilling techniques 
the installation work is scheduled to commence in the second quarter of and is estimated to be completed by year end the lay barge gulf horizon and the dedicated bury barge canyon horizon are expected to be utilized on this project 
also in march  we were awarded a contract for approximately million with pemex  under the current senior management  for the engineering  procurement and construction of several pipelines in the bay of campeche 
we expect to commence the project to lay and trench pipelines ranging in size from to diameter and expect to perform one shore approach  end connections  topside piping and testing 
the derrick barge atlantic horizon and lay barge lone star horizon will be utilized on the project 
offshore construction is scheduled to begin in the second quarter of as of march   our backlog totaled approximately million compared to our backlog at march  of approximately million 
our expansion into the middle east and an increase in new pemex project activity in mexico have increased our backlog 
of the total backlog as of march   approximately million is not expected to be earned until after critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
we must apply significant  subjective and complex estimates and judgments in this process 
among the factors  but not fully inclusive of all factors  that may be considered by management in these processes are the range of accounting policies permitted by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  management s understanding of our business  expected rates of business and operational change  sensitivity and volatility associated with the assumptions used in developing estimates  and whether historical trends are expected to be representative of future trends 
among the most subjective judgments employed in the preparation of these financial statements are estimates of expected costs to complete construction projects  the collectibility of contract receivables and claims  the fair value of salvage inventory  the depreciable lives of and future cash flows to be provided by our equipment  the period and extent of maintenance and repairs for dry docking activity  estimates for the number and related costs of insurance claims for medical care and jones act obligations  judgments regarding the outcomes of pending and potential litigation and certain judgments regarding the nature of income and expenditures for tax purposes 
we review all significant estimates on a recurring basis and record the effect of any necessary adjustments prior to publication of our financial statements 
adjustments made with respect to the use of estimates often relate to improved information not previously available 
because of the inherent uncertainties in this process  actual future results could differ from those expected at the reporting date 

table of contents our significant accounting policies are described in note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
we consider certain accounting policies to be critical policies due to the significant judgments  subjective and complex estimation processes and uncertainties involved for each in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following represent our critical accounting policies 
we have discussed our critical accounting policies and estimates  together with any changes therein  with the audit committee of our board of directors 
revenue recognition contract revenues for construction contracts are recognized on the percentage of completion method  measured by the percentage of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion for each contract 
this percentage is applied to the estimated revenue at completion to calculate revenues earned to date 
we consider the percentage of completion method to be the best available measure of progress on these contracts 
we follow the guidance of aicpa statement of position sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts relating to the use of the percentage of completion method  estimating costs and claim recognition for construction contracts 
estimating costs to complete each contract pursuant to sop is a significant variable in determining the amount of revenues earned to date 
we continually analyze the costs to complete each contract and recognize the cumulative impact of revisions in total cost estimates in the period in which the changes become known 
in determining total costs to complete each contract  we apply judgment in the estimating process 
contract revenue reflects the original contract price adjusted for agreed upon change orders and unapproved claims 
for contract change orders  claims or similar items  we apply judgment in estimating the amounts and assessing the potential for realization 
we recognize unapproved claims only when the collection is deemed probable and if the amount can be reasonably estimated for purposes of calculating total profit or loss on long term contracts 
we record revenue and the unbilled receivable for claims to the extent of costs incurred and to the extent we believe related collection is probable and include no profit on claims recorded 
changes in job performance  job conditions and estimated profitability  including those arising from claims and final contract settlements  may result in revisions to estimated costs and revenues and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined 
the asset costs in excess of billings represents the costs and estimated earnings recognized as revenue in excess of amounts billed as determined on an individual contract basis 
the liability billings in excess of costs represents amounts billed in excess of costs and estimated earnings recognized as revenue on an individual contract basis 
for certain service contracts  revenues are recognized under sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  and no 
 revenue recognition  when all of the following criteria are met  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenues from salvage projects sometimes include non cash values assigned to structures that are received from time to time as partial consideration for services performed 
in assigning values to structures received  we apply judgment in estimating the fair value of salvage inventory 
the complexity of the estimation process and all issues related to the assumptions  risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of the percentage of completion methodologies affect the amounts reported in our financial statements 
if our business conditions were different  or if we used different assumptions in the application of this accounting policy  it is likely that materially different amounts could be reported in our financial statements 
if we used the completed contract method to account for our revenues  our results of operations would reflect greater variability in quarterly revenues and profits as no revenues or costs would be recognized on projects until the projects were substantially complete  which for larger contracts could involve deferrals for several quarters 
accounts receivable we have significant investments in billed and unbilled receivables as of december  billed receivables represents amounts billed upon the completion of small contracts and progress billings on large contracts in accordance with contract terms and milestones 
unbilled receivables on fixed price contracts arise as revenues are recognized under the percentage of completion method 
unbilled amounts on cost reimbursement contracts represent recoverable costs and accrued profits not yet billed 
allowances for doubtful accounts and estimated nonrecoverable costs primarily provide for losses that may be sustained on unapproved change orders and claims 
we evaluate our contract receivables and costs in 
table of contents excess of billings and thoroughly review historical collection experience  the financial condition of our customers  billing disputes and other factors 
prior to the fourth quarter of  we had not experienced any significant losses on receivables 
we negotiate change orders and unapproved claims with our customers 
in particular  unsuccessful negotiations of unapproved claims could result in decreases in estimated contract profit or additional contract losses  while successful claims negotiations could result in increases in estimated contract profit or recovery of previously recorded contract losses 
any future significant losses on receivables would adversely affect our financial position  results of operations and our overall liquidity 
we continue to negotiate with and use our best efforts to resolve our epc contract claims against pemex 
the pemex personnel responsible for the epc contract at the time it was ongoing are no longer participating in the settlement negotiations of these claims  which has hindered our ability to resolve them 
from november through march  we engaged a consulting firm in mexico to assist us in the administration of our pemex claims 
after complying with pemex s requirements  we formally submitted these claims in july upon the formal submission of such claims  we expected to resolve them by the end of the fourth quarter of however  during the fourth quarter of  it became apparent that the current management at pemex was resistant to accepting responsibility for resolving these claims due to the changes in personnel negotiating these claims on behalf of pemex and to the operating structure of pemex 
prior to that time  pemex personnel had given us assurances that our properly supported claims would be paid  and our consulting firm from mexico indicated they believed we would be able to collect the carrying value of our claims 
at december   since there was no final resolution of these claims and the ultimate amount and timing of payment of these claims was uncertain  we reserved million related to our previously recorded outstanding unapproved claims against pemex 
the total claims that we submitted to pemex approximated million and included unapproved claims for extra work related to interferences  interruptions and other delays as well as claims for additional scope of work performed 
the unapproved claims recorded as revenue to the extent of costs incurred through december  do not include any profit and are substantially less than the actual claims submitted to pemex 
of the million of claims submitted  the carrying value at december   prior to the reserve recorded  consisted of million of unapproved claims and million of additional scope of work 
if we are unsuccessful in resolving our epc contract claims against pemex  we intend to submit some or all of the claims to arbitration in mexico in accordance with the rules of arbitration of the international chamber of commerce 
as of december   we had remaining unreserved contract receivables of million and costs in excess of billings of million from pemex  totaling million 
we subsequently collected the million of contract receivables that were outstanding as of december  related to work performed as additional scope of work 
our unreserved net claim receivable remaining from december  of approximately million  which includes approximately million of unapproved claims and million of additional scope of work  is our best estimate of the amount we believe we will collect on our epc contract claims 
we based our best current estimate of ultimate collectibility on the limited indications from pemex during the fourth quarter of of of suggested settlements on the portion of the claims not related to interferences and interruptions 
pemex officials involved in the negotiation of the claims have failed to indicate to us the amounts of which they might settle the claims related to interferences and interruptions 
settlement of this amount and final resolution could reasonably be expected to vary from million 
had we not estimated a portion of the interferences and interruptions claims that would be collected  the loss would be greater 
a failure to recover any amounts from pemex in negotiations or possible arbitration could result in a further loss of up to our carrying value of million 
it is possible that the epc claim could be settled for an amount in excess of our recorded balance  which could result in a gain recognized in the period settlement is reached 
the process for resolving these claims could continue into and beyond 
collection of amounts related to these claims would be remitted directly as prepayment of our subordinated notes issued in march as of december   we had unreserved contract receivables of million and costs in excess of billings of million from iroquois totaling million 
we have subsequently billed the amounts included in costs in excess of billings as of december  on january   we filed a lawsuit for breach of contract and wrongful withholding of amounts due to us for services performed under our contract with iroquois 
given the early stages of negotiations  we cannot predict whether a negotiated resolution of this dispute will occur or  if such a resolution does occur  the precise terms of such a resolution 
we could incur a loss for uncollectible accounts of up to the carrying value of million 
as of december   we had total claims of million against williams and had recognized revenue to the extent of cost representing million in unreserved contract receivables 
on september   we filed a lawsuit for breach of contract and wrongful withholding of amounts due to us for services performed under our contract with williams 
given the early stages of negotiations  we cannot predict whether a negotiated resolution of this dispute will occur or  if such a resolution does occur  the precise terms of such a resolution 
we could incur a loss for uncollectible accounts of up to the carrying value of million 
property and equipment we use the units of production method to calculate depreciation on our major barges and vessels to approximate the wear and tear of normal use 
the annual depreciation based on utilization of each vessel will not be less than of annual straight line depreciation  and the cumulative depreciation based on utilization of each vessel will not be less than of cumulative straight line depreciation 
accelerated depreciation methods are used for tax purposes 
the useful lives of our major barges and vessels range from years to years 
upon sale or retirement  the cost of the equipment and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is recognized 
if we alternatively applied only a straight line depreciation method  less depreciation expense would be recorded in periods of high vessel utilization and more depreciation expense would be recorded in periods of low vessel utilization 
we believe the method we use better matches costs with the physical use of the equipment 
when events or changes in circumstances indicate that assets may be impaired  we evaluate the carrying value of the asset 
changes in our business plans  a change in the physical condition of a long lived asset or the extent or manner in which it is being used  or a severe or sustained downturn in the oil and gas industry are considered triggering events 
the carrying value of each vessel is compared to the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows for that vessel 
if the carrying value of any vessel is more than the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows expected to result from the use of the vessel  a write down of the vessel to estimated fair market value must be made 
when quoted market prices are 
table of contents not available  fair value must be determined based upon other valuation techniques 
this could include appraisals or present value calculations of estimated future cash flows 
in the calculation of fair market value  including the discount rate used and the timing of the related cash flows  as well as undiscounted future net cash flows  we apply judgment in our estimates and projections  which could result in varying levels of impairment recognition 
based on our analysis of the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows for our long term assets during the fourth quarter of  we determined that five of our marine vessels and related equipment were impaired under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and recognized a loss of million to reflect the fair market value of these impaired assets 
the impairment loss included the write off of million of capitalized dry dock costs associated with these impaired vessels 
due to lower expected utilization levels  the value of the phoenix horizon  two diving support vessels  one small construction vessel  a cargo barge and related marine equipment has been impaired 
we previously recognized a million impairment loss related to the phoenix horizon for the year ended december  the impairment of the phoenix horizon in was a result of a further decline in its fair market value and management s decision not to make capital improvements that are required to place the vessel into service due to the availability of other operational assets 
the sustained difficult economic environment  depressed market for the marine construction industry and increased competition for marine construction projects awarded throughout have decreased the utilization of our vessels  triggering the impairment of the other vessels  the cargo barge and related marine equipment 
other assets dry dock costs are direct costs associated with scheduled major maintenance on our marine construction vessels in accordance with certain regulations and are capitalized and amortized over the five year cycle to the next scheduled dry docking 
we wrote off million of capitalized dry dock costs during the fourth quarter of related to the impairment of three small construction vessels under sfas no 
on june   the aicpa issued an exposure draft of a proposed sop  accounting for certain costs and activities related to property  plant  and equipment 
if adopted  we would be required to expense dry docking costs on our vessels as incurred 
we incurred and capitalized dry dock costs of million in  million in and million in as of december   capitalized dry dock costs totaled million 
expensing dry dock costs would likely result in greater variability of our quarterly operating results as a substantial portion of our dry dock activities take place during the first and fourth quarters and would aversely affect our financial position and results of operation 
stock based compensation we have elected the method that requires disclosure of stock based compensation pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
because of this election  we account for stock based employee compensation under the recognition and measurement principles of apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
no stock based employee compensation cost is reflected in net income loss  except for the compensation expense recorded below  as all options granted had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
additionally  for stock based compensation grants to non employees  we recognize as compensation expense the fair market value of such grants as calculated pursuant to sfas no 
 amortized ratably over the lesser of the vesting period of the respective option or the individual s expected service period 
in january  we granted options to three former directors to purchase  shares of common stock at an exercise price equal to the market price of the common stock on the date of grant 
these options vested immediately  and  was recorded as compensation expense in the statements of operations during the first quarter of also  we recorded an additional  as compensation expense in the statements of operations during the second quarter of related to the remeasurement of options in connection with the resignation of a key employee 
the fasb has recently proposed to mandate expense recognition for stock options and other types of equity based compensation based on the fair value of the options at the grant date 
additionally  the fasb is evaluating how to develop a measure of the fair value of an option 
based on the final outcome of the fasb proposal  we may be required to recognize expense related to stock options and other types of equity based compensation in future periods 
additionally  we may be required to change our method for determining the fair value of stock options 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires the recognition of income tax expense for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and for deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity s financial statements or tax returns 
we must make significant assumptions  judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes and also our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against our net deferred tax asset 
the current provision for income tax is based upon the current tax laws and our interpretation of these laws  as well as the probable outcomes of any foreign or domestic tax audits 
the value of our net deferred tax asset is dependent upon our predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income and is reduced by the amount of any tax benefits that are not expected to be realized 
as of december   a valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets that are not expected to be realized due to the uncertainty of future taxable income in the amount of million was charged as income tax expense 
actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could render our current assumptions  judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes inaccurate  thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations 
recent accounting pronouncements in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections  which revises current guidance with respect to gains and losses on early extinguishment of debt 
under sfas no 
 gains and losses on early extinguishment of debt will no longer be treated as extraordinary items unless they meet the criteria for extraordinary treatment in accounting principles board apb opinion no 
we were required to adopt sfas no 
effective january  upon adoption  we reclassified the extraordinary loss on early extinguishment of debt of  from extraordinary items to other expense 
table of contents for the year ended december   as this amount no longer qualified for extraordinary treatment under sfas no 
in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
in december  the fasb issued a revised version of this interpretation  fin r 
fin r addresses the requirements for business enterprises to consolidate certain variable interest entities who are the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
fin and fin r are effective immediately for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after january  the revised provisions of the interpretation will become applicable for the first reporting period ending after march  for variable interest entities created before february  the adoption of fin and fin r is not anticipated to have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
establishes how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments that have characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
the statement requires that an issuer classify financial instruments that are within its scope as a liability and requires disclosure regarding the terms of those instruments and settlement alternatives 
previously  many of these instruments were classified as equity or as mezzanine instruments between the liabilities and the equity section 
sfas no 
is effective immediately for qualifying financial instruments issued after may  and was effective for existing issuances as of the third quarter ended september  adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position 

table of contents results of operations information relating to horizon s operations follows in millions year ended december  revenues domestic latin america west africa southeast asia other total gross profit domestic latin america west africa southeast asia other unallocated costs total gross profit data was not monitored on a geographic basis during and is therefore not presented herein 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  contract revenues 
contract revenues were million for  compared to million for revenues decreased compared with last year 
the decline in revenues is attributable to a decrease in pricing of services for marine construction in the us gulf of mexico due to a highly competitive market during our customer mix in changed significantly compared to the mix of customers in the significant decline in revenues from pemex from of our total revenues in to in to in have impacted our total revenues  gross profit and the change in customer mix 
in  we completed the remainder of a contract for pemex and recognized million of revenues 
this reduction in revenues in for latin america was offset by our expansion into other international areas 
we completed two large projects in southeast asia  offshore brunei and malaysia  as well as began work on a major project in west africa  offshore nigeria 
we also completed two large projects in the northeastern us during  further offsetting the decrease in revenue in latin america 
work performed in the northeastern us is included in our domestic operations 
gross profit 
gross profit was million of contract revenues for compared with a gross profit of million of contract revenues for in general  our gross profits for marine construction have declined over the past five years 
lower gross profits on projects in the northeastern us  reduced vessel utilization and unusually adverse weather conditions during  and resulting downtime and revenues recorded for such events  lowered gross profit 
our various projects in the northeastern us  which in total accounted for approximately of revenues  were primarily performed by subcontracted vessels rather than our own vessels  and as such  lower gross profits were recorded 
the gross profits on the pemex projects  which accounted for a greater percentage of revenues in  were higher than gross profits on other contracts in selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million of contract revenues for  compared with million of contract revenues for the slight decrease primarily relates to the reversal of accrued costs associated with our pemex claims  offset by increases in costs associated with international operations  additional depreciation expense for corporate fixed assets placed into service during the second half of and first quarter of  and severance and other charges due to the resignation of a key employee in 
table of contents pemex epc reserve 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a reserve of million related to our outstanding epc contract claims against pemex since we have been unsuccessful in resolving such claims 
since the ultimate amount and timing of payment of these claims is uncertain  we recorded this reserve for the outstanding receivable to reflect our best estimate of the amount that we believe we will collect 
we did not record any reserve related to this pemex receivable during or impairment of property and equipment 
a million impairment loss was recognized under sfas no 
during on several of our marine construction vessels 
due to lower expected utilization levels  the value of the phoenix horizon  two diving support vessels  one small construction vessel  a cargo barge and related marine equipment has been impaired 
we previously recognized a million impairment loss related to the phoenix horizon for the year ended december  the impairment of the phoenix horizon in is a result of a further decline in its fair market value and management s determination not to make capital improvements required to place the vessel into service due to the availability of other operational assets 
the sustained difficult economic environment  depressed market for the marine construction industry and increased competition for construction projects throughout has resulted in a decline in the utilization of our vessels  triggering the impairment of the other vessels and the cargo barge 
the impairment losses were based upon the cost of the vessels in excess of their estimated fair value based upon expected sales prices as determined by broker quotations or orderly liquidation value appraisals from third parties 
interest expense 
interest expense for was million  net of million of capitalized interest 
interest expense for was million  net of million of capitalized interest 
total outstanding debt was million at december  compared with million at december  interest expense increased due to higher average outstanding debt balances  higher interest rates and other costs associated with the additional financing secured during the second quarter of interest income 
interest income includes interest from cash investments for the years ended december  and of  and  respectively 
interest income declined as we have closely managed our cash position during  and we were required to borrow funds to meet working capital requirements 
loss on debt extinguishment 
loss on debt extinguishment relates to a prepayment penalty of  and the write off of deferred loan fees of  for the early retirement of debt during the second quarter of in june  we refinanced the sea horizon with another lender and used a portion of the proceeds to repay and extinguish our previous lender s debt resulting in the loss on debt extinguishment 
this refinancing secured in provided additional liquidity and working capital to fund operations due to our inability to collect our pemex receivables and claims 
there were no losses on debt extinguishment during other income expense 
other income expense for primarily consisted of  of net foreign currency loss due to activity in mexico denominated in mexican pesos and a weakening of the mexican peso compared to the us dollar 
included in other income expense for is a million loss related to a fire on the lone star horizon  and million of foreign currency loss due to activity denominated in mexican pesos and a weakening of the mexican peso compared to the us dollar 

table of contents income taxes benefit 
we use the liability method of accounting for income taxes 
we recorded a federal income tax benefit of million  at a net effective rate of on a pre tax loss of million for we recorded a federal income tax benefit of million  at a net effective rate of on a pre tax loss of million for the difference in the effective tax rate and the statutory tax rate for is primarily due to the valuation allowance of million recorded during the fourth quarter of to fully offset the net deferred tax asset 
the utilization of any net operating loss carryforwards is dependent on the future profitability of the company 
accordingly  no assurance can be given regarding the ultimate realization of such loss carryforwards 
the difference from the statutory tax rate for is due to the application of the extraterritorial income exclusion for income earned primarily in mexico from january  to december  the exclusion allows us to exclude a portion of income earned outside the united states for tax purposes 
the impact of this exclusion on future periods will vary depending upon the amount of income earned outside the united states 
changes in our ownership levels  future  current and past  may result in limitations on our annual and aggregate ability to utilize net operating losses 
net income 
net loss was million  or per share diluted  for  compared to a net loss for of million  or per share diluted 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  contract revenues 
contract revenues were million for  compared to million for revenues increased compared with last year 
our projects in mexico contributed approximately million in revenues during  compared with million during the decline in revenues from the projects in mexico was offset by revenues of million from the iroquois pipeline installation and burial project and by revenues from other international projects 
revenues recognized in and included million and million  respectively  from salvage and installation projects in the us gulf of mexico 
of the million in revenues recognized in  approximately million represents values assigned to structures received as partial consideration for salvage projects performed 
no significant non cash consideration was received in gross profit 
gross profit was million of contract revenues for compared with a gross profit of million of contract revenues for excluding the effect of the claims on the pemex projects for which revenues were recognized to the extent of actual costs incurred  gross profit as a percentage of revenues was for compared with for the decline was due to lower gross profit bid on jobs as a result of competitive market conditions

liquidity and capital resources over the past two years we have experienced operating and net losses  resulting in noncompliance with our debt covenants 
subsequent to december  and in connection with our subordinated note issuance in march  we amended our existing debt covenants and expect to be in compliance with the amended terms during during  we took actions to improve our competitiveness  operating results and cash flow by reorganizing our operations and incorporating a project management oriented approach in an effort to more efficiently and effectively execute our marine construction projects 
we reduced headcount in in light of the sustained depressed market in the us gulf of mexico 
we believe that these measures taken in  combined with the additional financing obtained in march  will improve our operating results 
our cash flows from operations and along with available borrowing capacity under our bank revolving credit facilities as a result of the subordinated note issuance should be sufficient to finance our working capital and other capital requirements until at least december  management  however  believes that we will need to complete the refinancing of our revolving credit facilities maturing in january and depending on market conditions  consummate an equity offering to refinance all or a portion of our subordinated notes 
management further believes that should the market in the us gulf of mexico remain depressed additional actions can be taken to reduce operating expenses 
cash used in operations was million for the year ended compared to cash provided by operations of million for and cash used in operations of billion for the increase in funds used in operations is primarily attributable to our pretax loss of million for the year ended december   and an increase in contract receivables associated with revenues and delays in collections of these revenues 
cash provided by operations of million in was primarily attributable to the billing and subsequent collection of projects in latin america and the northeastern us as well as the increases in current liabilities related to the extension of the timing of payments by us 
cash used in operations of million in was primarily attributable to the increase in costs in excess of billings related to our epc contract with pemex 
cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended compared to cash used in investing activities of million and million for and  respectively 
the decrease in funds used in investing activities is attributable to a decline in our capital expenditures during due to lower levels of vessel utilization and competitive market conditions in the us gulf of mexico 
during  we made significant upgrades to the sea horizon  our largest vessel  and other vessels in our fleet to prepare them for major projects in southeast asia  west africa and the northeastern us during  we used significant funds for the initial purchase of two of our larger marine construction vessels 
cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended compared to cash provided by financing activities of million for and million for the increase in funds provided by financing activities is primarily attributable to the additional million in secured asset based financing obtained during the second quarter of also  in  we borrowed additional funds under our revolving credit facilities to meet our short term operating needs 
for the year ended december   we received million from our public stock offering which was offset by the funds used to reduce indebtedness under our revolving credit facilities 
the significant cash provided by financing activities in primarily relate to the million we received from our public offering in february as well as borrowings under our revolving credit facilities 
during the second quarter of  we secured million in secured asset based financing from three lenders  of which million was funded during the second quarter of and million was funded in july the proceeds were used to repay our million loan with gmac business credit  llc  and the remaining proceeds were used to provide working capital to support operations

in addition  in connection with our subordinated note offering  we amended the financial covenants in all of our existing loan agreements to require a ratio of current assets to current liabilities of to for the period ending march   to for the period ending june   to for the period ending september   to for the period ending december  and to for the period ending march  and each period thereafter  each computed by excluding our revolving credit facilities from current liabilities  a fixed charge coverage ratio of to for the three month period ending september   to for the six month period ending december   to for the nine month period ending march   and to for each period thereafter on a rolling four quarter basis  a tangible net worth in an amount not less the sum of million plus of our consolidated net income for each fiscal quarter which has been completed as of the date of calculation  commencing with the fiscal quarter ending march  plus of the net proceeds of any common stock or other equity issued after december   and if the sum of our net income before gains and losses on sales of assets to the extent such gains and losses are included in earnings  plus tax expense plus restructuring charges  including costs of our and our lenders or other creditors professional advisors not to exceed  for the fiscal year ended december  to be less than negative million for the three month period ending march   negative million for the six month period ending june   million for the nine month period ending september   and million for the twelve month period ending december  for more information on our new financial covenants  see exhibits through that are filed herewith

at december   we had approximately million of total outstanding debt 
this represents an approximate net increase of million from december  primarily due to additional borrowings to meet working capital needs during of the million of outstanding debt  million represents borrowings on our three revolving credit facilities and million represents borrowings on our eight term debt facilities 
at december   we had no additional available borrowings under our three revolving credit facilities  and we had million of cash and cash equivalents 
our weighted average interest rate on all indebtedness was at december   and our term debt borrowings currently require  in monthly principal payments 
current maturities of long term debt were million as of december  subsequent to the issuance of the subordinated notes  our total indebtedness was approximately million 
we will need to use a large portion of our cash flow from operations to pay principal and interest on our outstanding debt 

table of contents our primary liquidity needs are to meet debt service and provide working capital to support our projects and other operations 
we had million of working capital at december  compared to million of working capital at december  the decrease in working capital was primarily attributable to our pretax losses for the year ended december   the reserve recorded for our unapproved claims against pemex and the current classification of the million elliott associates term loan 
this decrease in working capital was partially offset by the increase in contract receivables related to contract revenues for our loans require that certain conditions be met in order for us to obtain advances 
our loans are collateralized by mortgages on our vessels and property and by accounts receivable 
advances under our revolving credit facilities may be obtained in accordance with a borrowing base defined as a percentage of accounts receivable balances and costs in excess of billings 
the loans contain customary default and cross default provisions and some require us to maintain certain financial ratios at quarterly determination dates 
the loan agreements also contain certain covenants that limit our ability to incur additional debt  pay dividends  create certain liens  sell assets and make capital expenditures 
for the quarter ended december   we did not meet certain covenants for all of our credit facilities that contain financial covenants 
in march  we received waivers of compliance for the december  determination date from all of our lenders that require us to meet these covenants 
in conjunction with the issuance of the subordinated notes  we also successfully revised our financial covenants contained in these credit facilities with all of our lenders through the maturity of these various loan agreements 
our new financial covenants are described above 
based on management s current projections  we expect to be in compliance with our revised debt covenants until at least december  in the event that we do not meet our financial covenants in the future  and we are unsuccessful in obtaining waivers of compliance  our lenders would have the right to accelerate our debt with them  and cross default provisions could result in acceleration of our other indebtedness  including the subordinated notes 
our inability to collect our receivables from pemex continues to impact our liquidity 
we have been unsuccessful in resolving our epc contract claims that we submitted to pemex of approximately million 
the unapproved claims recorded as revenue to the extent of costs incurred through december  do not include any profit and are substantially less than the actual claims submitted to pemex 
the unapproved claims recorded as revenue to the extent of costs incurred through december  do not include any profit and are substantially less than the actual claims submitted to pemex 
the carrying value of our claims consisted of approximately million of unapproved claims and approximately million of additional scope of work performed 
we have collected approximately million the million of claims as of december  related to our delays 
subsequent to december   we collected approximately million related to additional scope of work performed 
pemex substantially increased the scope of our operations under this contract during to  which subjected the project to greater interruptions due to adverse weather conditions and standby time as other contractors completed their work 
we continue to negotiate with and use our best efforts to resolve our epc contract claims against pemex 
we previously anticipated that these claims would be resolved by the end of the fourth quarter of during the fourth quarter of  however  since there was no final resolution of these claims and the ultimate amount and timing of payment of these claims was uncertain  we have recorded a million reserve for unapproved claims 
the carrying value of our claims as of december  is million and consists of million of unapproved claims and million remaining of additional scope of work 
if we are unsuccessful in resolving these claims  we intend to submit some or all of the claims to arbitration in mexico in accordance with the rules of arbitration of the international chamber of commerce 
however  due to the size of the dispute and inherent uncertainties with respect to arbitration  we cannot predict whether a negotiated resolution of this dispute will occur or  if such a resolution does occur  the precise terms of such a resolution 
an adverse outcome from negotiations or possible arbitration could result in a further loss of up to the carrying value of million 
collection of amounts related to these claims would be remitted directly as prepayment of our subordinated notes issued in march our liquidity also has been impacted by delay in collecting approximately million of receivables from iroquois and million of unreserved contract receivables from williams 
we have filed suit against iroquois in the supreme court of the state of new york  new york county  for breach of contract and for damages for failure to pay for work performed 
we have filed suit against williams in the th judicial district of the district court for harris county  texas for breach of contract and wrongful withholding of amounts due to us for services 
any adverse outcome of these lawsuits could result in a loss up to the respective carrying value of our claims 
see item legal proceedings for a detailed discussion of this litigation 

table of contents our ability to service our existing debt  provide working capital and fund our capital expenditure requirements has been adversely affected by the inability to collect our pemex receivables and claims and our iroquois and williams receivables 
during  we have closely managed our cash position and borrowed funds  including the million of asset based financing to meet working capital requirements  due to the delayed timing of the collection of our pemex receivables and claims and the significant delays in collection of our receivables from iroquois and williams 
also  the net proceeds of approximately million received from the issuance of the subordinated notes in march will allow us to meet our immediate working capital needs  start up new projects and make improvements to our fleet as necessary to support our operations 
the timing of the collection of progress payments and our ability to stay on budget for our projects significantly impacts our cash flow and liquidity 
we expect that the volume of our future contract revenues will largely influence our working capital and cash requirements 
our cash requirements are greatest at the start up of a new project since we are required to incur mobilization expenses and complete all or a substantial portion of the majority of our projects before receiving payment from the customer 
although there can be no assurance  we believe that this additional financing and funds from operations will be sufficient in order to maintain necessary levels of operating liquidity until at least december  however  we believe we will need to consummate an equity offering to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on our revolving credit facilities maturing in january and the subordinated notes 
we have fixed debt service and lease payment obligations under notes payable and operating leases for which we have material contractual cash obligations 
interest rates on our debt vary from commercial paper plus to a fixed 
the following table summarizes our long term material contractual cash obligations as of december  in thousands thereafter principal and interest payments on debt operating leases as a result of the issuance of the subordinated notes in march  our long term material contractual cash obligations for have increased by approximately million 
in the event we receive payment on the outstanding pemex and williams claims and receivables  we must immediately remit the amounts collected as a prepayment of the outstanding subordinated notes 
we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
planned capital expenditures for are estimated to range from approximately million to million primarily related to vessel improvements 
these expenditures will depend upon available funds  work awarded and future operating activity 
despite our current liquidity issues  our long term strategy is to expand our operating capabilities and operations into additional selected international areas 
to the extent we are successful in identifying opportunities to expand our market share in those areas  we will likely require additional equity 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our market risk exposures primarily include interest rate and exchange rate fluctuation on financial instruments as detailed below 
our market risk sensitive instruments are classified as other than trading 
the following sections address the significant market risks associated with our financial activities for the year ended december  our exposure to market risk as discussed below includes forward looking statements and represents estimates of possible changes in fair values  future earnings or cash flows that would occur assuming hypothetical future movements in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates 
as of december   the carrying value of our debt  including million of accrued interest  was approximately million 
the fair value of this debt approximates the carrying value because most of the interest rates are based on floating rates identified by reference to market rates 
our million term loan with elliott associates  which was repaid in full in march  was fixed at an interest rate 
a hypothetical increase in the applicable interest rates as of december  would increase annual interest expense by approximately million 
we collect a portion of international contract revenues and pay local expenses in foreign currency 
we manage foreign currency risk by attempting to contract as much foreign revenue as possible in us dollars 
we monitor the exchange rate of our foreign currencies in order to mitigate the risk from foreign currency fluctuations 
additional exposure could occur as we expand internationally 
the level of construction services required by a customer depends on the size of its capital expenditure budget for construction for the year 
consequently  customers that account for a significant portion of contract revenues in one year may represent an immaterial portion of contract revenues in subsequent years
