item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview eastgroup s goal is to maximize shareholder value by being a leading provider of functional  flexible  and quality business distribution space for location sensitive tenants primarily in the  to  square foot range 
the company develops  owns and operates distribution facilities  the majority of which are clustered around major transportation features in supply constrained submarkets in major sunbelt markets 
the company s core markets are primarily in the states of california  florida  texas and arizona 
the company primarily generates its revenues by leasing space at its real estate properties 
as such  eastgroup s greatest challenge is leasing space at competitive market rates 
the company s primary risks are lease expirations and rental decreases resulting from deteriorating market conditions 
during  leases on of eastgroup s portfolio square footage expired  and the company was successful in renewing or re leasing of that total 
in addition  eastgroup leased million square feet of space that was vacant at december  eastgroup s total leased percentage increased to at december  from in the prior year 
due to sluggishness in the economy  the company experienced average rental decreases of for the expiring leases for were of the portfolio at december  since the end of  the company has experienced positive leasing activity and reduced this percentage to as of march  the company generates new revenues through its acquisition and development programs 
during  the company purchased five properties and transferred three properties and one expansion from development 
for  the company has projected million in new acquisitions and has identified approximately million of development opportunities 
eastgroup continues to see targeted development as a major contributor to the company s growth 
the company mitigates risks associated with development by maintaining a board approved maximum level of land held for development and adjusting development start dates according to leasing activity 
the company primarily funds its acquisition and development programs through a million line of credit as discussed in liquidity and capital resources below 
as market conditions permit  eastgroup issues equity  including preferred equity  and or employs fixed rate  nonrecourse first mortgage debt to replace the short term bank borrowings 
the company has no off balance sheet arrangements 
during  the company took advantage of the attractive capital markets and strengthened its balance sheet with two direct placements of common stock  a direct placement of perpetual preferred stock and the closing of a nonrecourse first mortgage 
eastgroup used the proceeds from the sale of the series d preferred offering and a portion of a common stock offering to redeem all of the company s series a preferred  resulting in a lower cost of capital 
during  the company plans to obtain million of additional fixed rate debt  using the proceeds to reduce variable rate bank line balances 
the company s chief decision makers use two primary measures of operating results in making decisions  such as allocating resources property net operating income pnoi  defined as income from real estate operations less property operating expenses before interest expense and depreciation and amortization  and funds from operations ffo  defined as net income loss computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of depreciable real estate property  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
the company continues to calculate ffo based on the national association of real estate investment trust s nareit s definition  which excludes gains on depreciable real estate 
see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for reconciliations of pnoi and ffo available to common stockholders to net income 
pnoi is a supplemental industry reporting measurement used to evaluate the performance of the company s real estate investments 
the company believes that the exclusion of depreciation and amortization in the industry s calculation of pnoi provides a supplemental indicator of the properties performance since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions 
pnoi as calculated by the company may not be comparable to similarly titled but differently calculated measures for other reits 
the major factors that influence pnoi are occupancy levels  acquisitions and sales  development properties that achieve stabilized operations  rental rate increases or decreases  and the recoverability of operating expenses 
the company s success depends largely upon its ability to lease warehouse space and to recover from tenants the operating costs associated with those leases 
real estate income is comprised of rental income including straight line rent adjustments  pass through income and other real estate income including termination fees 
property operating expenses are comprised of insurance  property taxes  repair and maintenance expenses  management fees and other operating costs 
generally  the company s most significant operating expenses are insurance and property taxes 
tenant leases may be net leases in which the total operating expenses are recoverable  modified gross leases in which some of the operating expenses are recoverable  or gross leases in which no expenses are recoverable gross leases represent only a small portion of the company s total leases 
increases in property operating expenses are fully recoverable under net leases and recoverable to a high degree under modified gross leases 
modified gross leases often include base year amounts and expense increases over these amounts are recoverable 
the company s exposure to property operating expenses is primarily due to vacancies and leases for occupied space that limit the amount of expenses that can be recoverable 
the company believes ffo is an appropriate measure of performance for equity real estate investment trusts 
the company believes that excluding depreciation and amortization in the calculation of ffo is appropriate since real estate values have historically increased or decreased based on market conditions 
ffo is not considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap as an indication of the company s financial performance  or to cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of the company s liquidity  nor is it indicative of funds available to provide for the company s cash needs  including its ability to make distributions 
the company s key drivers affecting ffo are changes in pnoi as discussed above and interest rates  and the amount of leverage the company employs 
the company analyzes the following performance trends in evaluating the progress of the company o the ffo change represents the increase or decrease in ffo from the same quarter this year compared to last year 
the change was negative ffo decreased for the last seven quarters ended december  the fourth quarter of showed a decrease of 
the company is budgeting an increase for  primarily due to acquisitions and developments 
o same property noi change represents the pnoi increase or decrease for operating properties owned during the entire current period and prior year reporting period 
the change was negative for the last seven quarters ended june   caused by decreasing rental rates and occupancy 
the third and fourth quarters of showed small increases and the company is budgeting a small increase for o occupancy is the percentage of total leasable square footage for which the lease term has commenced as of the close of the reporting period 
for the last seven quarters ended december   occupancy has been in the range of to 
for  occupancy is budgeted to be in a range of to 
o rental rate change represents the rental rate increase or decrease on new leases compared to expiring leases on the same space 
rental rates decreased on expiring leases in the last five quarters ended december  the company is budgeting a decrease in rental rates for critical accounting policies and estimates the company s management considers the following accounting policies and estimates to be critical to the reported operations of the company 
real estate properties in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations  the company allocates the purchase price of acquired properties to net tangible and identified intangible assets based on their respective fair values 
the allocation to tangible assets land  building and improvements is based upon management s determination of the value of the property as if it were vacant using discounted cash flow models 
factors considered by management include an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease up periods considering current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases 
the remaining purchase price is allocated among three categories of intangible assets consisting of the above or below market component of in place leases  the value of in place leases and the value of customer relationships 
the value allocable to the above or below market component of an acquired in place lease is determined based upon the present value using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the acquired leases of the difference between i the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the lease over its remaining term  and ii management s estimate of the amounts that would be paid using fair market rates over the remaining term of the lease 
the amounts allocated to favorable and unfavorable in place leases are included in other assets and other liabilities  respectively  on the consolidated balance sheet and are amortized to rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases 
the total amount of intangible assets is further allocated to in place lease values and to customer relationship values based upon management s assessment of their respective values 
these intangible assets are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet and are amortized over the remaining term of the existing lease  or the anticipated life of the customer relationship  as applicable 
during the industrial development stage  costs associated with development ie  land  construction costs  interest expense during construction and lease up  property taxes and other direct and indirect costs associated with development are aggregated into the total capitalization of the property 
included in these costs are management s estimates for the portions of internal costs primarily personnel costs that are deemed directly or indirectly related to such development activities 
because the estimation of capitalizable internal costs requires management s judgment  the company believes internal cost capitalization is a critical accounting estimate 
the company reviews its real estate investments for impairment of value whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
if any real estate investment is considered permanently impaired  a loss is recorded to reduce the carrying value of the property to its estimated fair value 
real estate assets to be sold are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less selling costs 
the evaluation of real estate investments involves many subjective assumptions dependent upon future economic events that affect the ultimate value of the property 
currently  the company s management is not aware of any impairment issues nor has it experienced any significant impairment issues in recent years 
in the event of an impairment  the property s basis would be reduced and the impairment would be recognized as a current period charge in the income statement 
valuation of receivables the company is subject to tenant defaults and bankruptcies that could affect the collection of outstanding receivables 
in order to mitigate these risks  the company performs credit reviews and analyses on prospective tenants before significant leases are executed 
the company quarterly evaluates outstanding receivables and estimates the allowance for uncollectible accounts 
management specifically analyzes aged receivables  customer credit worthiness  historical bad debts and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company believes that its allowance for uncollectible accounts is adequate for its outstanding receivables at december  and in the event that the allowance for uncollectible accounts is insufficient for an account that is subsequently written off  additional bad debt would be recognized as a current period charge in the income statement 
tax status eastgroup  a maryland corporation  has qualified as a real estate investment trust under sections of the internal revenue code and intends to continue to qualify as such 
to maintain its status as a reit  the company is required to distribute of its ordinary taxable income to its stockholders 
the company has the option of i reinvesting the sales price of properties sold through tax deferred exchanges  allowing for a deferral of capital gains on the sale  ii paying out capital gains to the stockholders with no tax to the company  or iii treating the capital gains as having been distributed to the stockholders  paying the tax on the gain deemed distributed and allocating the tax paid as a credit to the stockholders 
the company distributed all of its  and taxable income to its stockholders 
accordingly  no provision for income taxes was necessary

all of these costs will be amortized over the remaining lives of the associated leases in place at the time of acquisition except for the customer relationship intangibles  which will be amortized over the expected useful lives of the related intangibles 
the company paid cash of  for the properties and intangibles acquired and assumed a mortgage of  which was repaid in development eastgroup s development program continues to be a major contributor to the company s growth

inflation in the last five years  inflation has not had a significant impact on the company because of the relatively low inflation rate in the company s geographic areas of operation 
most of the leases require the tenants to pay their pro rata share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes and insurance  thereby reducing the company s exposure to increases in operating expenses resulting from inflation 
in addition  the company s leases typically have three to five year terms  which may enable the company to replace existing leases with new leases at a higher base if rents on the existing leases are below the then existing market rate
