item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis is intended to assist the reader in evaluating and understanding the consolidated results of operations and financial condition of eastern virginia bankshares  inc the following analysis provides information about the major components of the results of operations  financial condition  liquidity and capital resources of eastern virginia bankshares and attempts to identify trends and material changes that occurred during the reporting periods 
the discussion should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents critical accounting policies general the company s financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap 
the financial information contained within our statements is  to a significant extent  financial information that is based on measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred 
a variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained either when earning income  recognizing an expense  recovering an asset or relieving a liability 
for example we use historical loss factors as one factor in determining the inherent loss that may be present in our loan portfolio 
actual losses could differ substantially from the historical factors that we use 
in addition  gaap itself may change from one previously acceptable method to another method 
although the economics of our transactions would be the same  the timing of events that would impact our transactions could change 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is an estimate of the losses that may be sustained in our loan portfolio 
the allowance is based on two basic principles of accounting i statement of financial accounting standards number  accounting for contingencies  which requires that losses be accrued when they are probable of occurring and estimable and ii sfas  accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  which requires that losses be accrued based on the differences between the value of the collateral  present value of future cash flows or values that are observable in the secondary market and the loan balance 
our allowance for loan losses has two basic components the formula allowance and the specific allowance 
each of these components is determined based upon estimates that can and do change when the actual events occur 
the formula allowance uses historical loss as an indicator of future losses and  as a result  could differ from the loss incurred in the future 
however  since the history is updated with the most recent loss information  management believes that the errors that might otherwise occur are mitigated 
the formula allowance is revised as deemed appropriate to capture losses that are attributable to economic events and industry or geographic sectors whose impact on the portfolio have occurred but have yet to be recognized in the specific allowance 
the specific allowance uses various techniques to arrive at an estimate of loss 
historical loss information  current level of nonaccrual loans  current level of unsecured loans past due to days and the fair market value of collateral are used to estimate these losses 
the use of these values is inherently subjective and our actual losses could be greater or less than the estimates 
in determining the adequacy of the allowance  management considers the company s historical loss experience  the size and composition of the loan portfolio  specific impaired loans  the overall level of nonperforming loans  the value and adequacy of collateral and guarantors  and economic conditions 
overview eastern virginia bankshares evb reported record net income and earnings per share for the year ended december  as it reaped the benefits of its long term strategic initiatives including three new branch offices opened in  a new branch office opened in the first quarter of  three new branches purchased from bb t first virginia bank hampton roads in september  and the achievement of meaningful profitability by the company s subsidiary hanover bank which opened in may the company benefited from low and reasonably stable interest rates during the year and from improved quality in its loan portfolio as the ratio of nonperforming assets declined from at year end to at year end  and net charge offs decreased  compared to the prior year 
the combination of the stable interest rate environment and improved loan quality resulted in a three basis point increase in net interest margin which increased to from the year margin of 
the company anticipates that the net interest margin for the year will decrease slightly from the level

evb s efficiency ratio  a measure of performance based upon the relationship between noninterest expense and income net of securities gains and losses  increased to compared to s 
a lower efficiency ratio represents greater control of noninterest costs 
fluctuation in the efficiency ratio can be attributed to relative changes in both noninterest income and net interest income as well as noninterest expense 
evb s increase in efficiency ratio was impacted favorably by the increase in net interest margin and unfavorably by growth in

for comparative purposes  income from tax exempt securities is adjusted to a tax equivalent basis using the federal statutory tax rate of 
tax equivalent securities income is further adjusted by the tefra adjustment for the disallowance as a deduction of a portion of total interest expense related to the ratio of average tax exempt securities to average total assets 
this adjustment results in tax exempt income and yields being presented on a basis comparable with income and yields from fully taxable earning assets 
net interest margin represents the company s net interest income divided by average earning assets 
changes in the volume and mix of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  as well as their respective yields and rates  have a significant impact on the level of net interest income 
the average balances  income and expense  yields and rates table presents average balances  related interest income and expense  and average yield cost data for each of the past three years

in  net interest income on a tax equivalent basis increased to million from million in average loan growth of was the primary factor in the increase in net interest income and in producing a net interest margin of  a basis point increase from in volume and rate analysis interest sensitivity evb s primary goals in interest rate risk management are to minimize negative fluctuations in net interest margin as a percentage of earning assets and to increase the dollar amount of net interest income at a growth rate consistent with the growth rate of total assets 
these goals are accomplished by managing the interest sensitivity gap  which is the difference between interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities in a specific time interval 
interest sensitivity gap is managed by balancing the volume of floating rate liabilities with a similar volume of floating rate assets  by keeping the average maturity of fixed rate asset and liability contracts reasonably consistent and short  and by routinely adjusting pricing to market conditions on a regular basis

large denomination certificates are those issued in amounts of thousand or greater 

table of contents the company generally strives to maintain a position flexible enough to move to equality between rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities  which may be desirable when there are wide and frequent fluctuations in interest rates 
matching the amount of assets and liabilities maturing in the same time interval helps to hedge interest rate risk and to minimize the impact on net interest income in periods of rising or falling interest rates 
when an unacceptable positive gap within a one year time frame occurs  maturities can be extended by selling shorter term investments and purchasing longer maturities 
when an unacceptable negative gap occurs  variable rate loans can be increased and more investment in shorter term investments can be made 
interest rate gaps are managed through investments  loan pricing and deposit pricing 
management of the interest rate gap has become much more challenging in the current environment when many depositors have chosen to move funds from certificates of deposit with a maturity of greater than one year to non maturity interest bearing savings  money market and now accounts 
while this customer change in deposit preference favorable impacts the current interest rate margin it creates a liability sensitive balance sheet  ie more liabilities subject to short term interest rate increases than the amount of assets subject to the same short term increases

residential real estate mortgages made up of the loan portfolio as compared to at year end and at year end the company s hanover bank subsidiary has experienced significant loan growth in both and with the dynamics of that market increasing evb s market share of commercial real estate loans and real estate construction loans 
commercial real estate loans increased from of the total loan portfolio at year end to at year end 
real estate construction loans accounted for of total loans outstanding at year end and at year end the company s losses on loans secured by real estate have historically been low  averaging thousand in net charge offs per year over the last five years 

table of contents consumer loans are the second largest component of evb s loan portfolio 
consumer loans were of the loan portfolio at year end  and at year end and respectively 
this portfolio component consists primarily of installment loans 
net consumer loans for household  family and other personal expenditures totaled million at year end  down million from million at year end 
general economic conditions and intense competition including zero interest financing by the automotive industry continued the trend that started in  decreasing consumer loans both in absolute amount and percentage of the total loan portfolio 
commercial and agricultural loans are designed specifically to meet the needs of small and medium size business customers 
this category of loans increased million in total loans outstanding at year end compared to  with the percentage to total loans decreasing to of the total loan portfolio from at year end consistent with its focus on providing community based financial services  evb generally does not make loans outside of its principal market region 
the company does not engage in foreign lending activities  consequently the loan portfolio is not exposed to the sometimes volatile risk from foreign credits 
evb further maintains a policy not to originate or purchase loans classified by regulators as highly leveraged transactions or loans to foreign entities or individuals 
the company s unfunded loan commitments  excluding credit card lines and letters of credit  at year end totaled million  down thousand from million at december  unfunded loan commitments excluding million in home equity lines are used in large part to meet seasonal funding needs which are generally higher from spring through fall than at year end 
historically  evb s loan collateral has been primarily real estate because of the nature of our market region 
asset quality the company s allowance for loan losses is an estimate of the amount needed to provide for potential losses in the loan portfolio 
in determining adequacy of the allowance  management considers the company s historical loss experience  the size and composition of the loan portfolio  specific impaired loans  the overall level of nonaccrual loans  the value and adequacy of collateral and guarantors  and economic conditions 
the allowance is increased by a provision for loan losses  which is charged to expense and reduced by charge offs  net of recoveries 
because the risk of loan loss includes general economic trends as well as conditions affecting individual borrowers  the allowance for loan losses can only be an estimate 
evb s ratio of nonperforming assets improved slightly in to a nonperforming asset level of at year end  compared to at year end actual nonperforming assets increased to million  compared to million at year end net charge offs for the year decreased thousand or to thousand  compared to million for prior year 
each of evb s subsidiary banks has a loan review function consisting of bank officers and board members 
additionally an independent credit review firm performs a review of loans for each of the banks 
as a matter of policy  the company places loans on nonaccrual status when a loan becomes days past due as to principal and interest  regardless of how well the loan may be collateralized 
the company utilizes a risk based evaluation system based on loan type  and payment history to determine the amount of the allowance for loan losses 
management believes the allowance for loan losses to be adequate based on this loan review process and analysis 
the company s decrease in charge offs and nonperforming asset ratio in allowed evb to lower its loan loss allowance ratio to at year end  compared to at december  and at year end  respectively 
for the same periods the loan loss allowance to nonaccrual loans ratio was  and  indicating that the allowance was adequate with respect to nonaccrual loans 
the allowance for loan losses is subject to regulatory examinations which may take into account such factors as methodology used to calculate the allowance and the size of the allowance in comparison to peer companies identified by regulatory agencies

nonperforming loans at year end consisted of million of loans secured by real estate in the company s market area  thousand of commercial and agricultural loans and thousand of consumer loans 
based on estimated fair values of the related collateral  management considers the nonperforming real estate loans recoverable  with any individual deficiency well covered by the allowance for loan losses 
the total amount of unsecured nonaccrual loans was thousand 
no interest is accrued on loans placed in a nonaccrual status  and any unpaid interest previously accrued on such past due loans is reversed when a loan is placed in nonaccrual status 
if interest on nonaccrual loans had been accrued  such income would have approximated thousand and thousand for the years and

although trends for credit quality factors continued to improve in  it is likely that evb will continue provisions for loan losses in the primary factor for additional provision is growth in the loan portfolio and the level of net charge offs and nonperforming loans 
the total loan loss provision for would have been lower without the million of loans acquired in the bb t first virginia bank hampton roads branch purchases 
the company s formula for allocation of the allowance reflects current net loans and nonaccrual loans plus the five year history for net charge offs by loan category

see note to the consolidated financial statements as of december  for an analysis of gross unrealized gains and losses in the securities portfolio 
deposits the company has historically focused on increasing core deposits to reduce the need for other borrowings to fund growth in earning assets 
core deposits provide a low cost  stable source of funding for the company s asset growth 
interest rates paid on deposits are carefully managed to provide an attractive market rate while at the same time not adversely affecting the net interest margin 
borrowing through the federal home loan bank of atlanta is utilized for funding when the cost of borrowed funds falls below the cost of new interest bearing deposits

commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
the commitments for equity lines of credit may expire without being drawn upon 
therefore  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
the amount of collateral obtained  if it is deemed necessary by the company  is based on management s credit evaluation of the customer 

table of contents unfunded commitments under commercial lines of credit  revolving credit lines and overdraft protection agreements are commitments for possible future extensions of credit to existing customers 
these lines of credit are usually uncollateralized and do not always contain a specified maturity date and may not be drawn upon to the total extent to which the company is committed 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
the credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers 
the company generally holds collateral supporting those commitments if deemed necessary 
liquidity liquidity represents an institution s ability to meet present and future financial obligations through either the sale or maturity of existing assets or the acquisition of additional funds through liability management 
liquid assets include cash  deposits with other banks  federal funds sold  investments and loans maturing or repricing within one year 
evb s management of liquid assets provides a liquidity level which management believes is sufficient to satisfy its depositors requirements and to meet its customers credit needs 
at december   million or of total earning assets were due to mature or reprice within the next year 
evb also maintains additional sources of liquidity through a variety of borrowing arrangements 
federal funds borrowing arrangements with major regional banks combined with lines of credit with the federal home loan bank totaled million at december  at year end  the company had million of fhlb borrowings outstanding 
the company s subsidiary banks borrowed million from the federal home loan bank in on a seven year principal reducing credit basis as an average cost of  specifically as a hedge against the banks year fixed rate mortgage program 
inflation in financial institutions  unlike most manufacturing companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on a bank s performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rate movement is not necessarily tied to movements in the same direction or with the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services  since such prices are affected by inflation to a larger extent than interest rates 
accounting rule changes in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  which amends sfas no

the provisions of the statement were effective december  management currently intends to continue to account for stock based compensation under the intrinsic value method set forth in accounting principles board apb opinion and related interpretations 
for this reason  the transition guidance of sfas no 
does not have an impact on the company s consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations 
the statement does amend existing guidance with respect to required disclosures  regardless of the method of accounting used 
the revised disclosure requirements are presented herein 
in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
the interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its financial statements under certain guarantees that it has issued

this interpretation provides guidance with respect to the identification of variable interest entities and when the assets  liabilities  noncontrolling interests  and results of operations of a variable interest entity need to be included in a company s consolidated financial statements 
the interpretation requires consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities in cases where a the equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties  which is provided through other interests that will absorb some or all of the expected losses of the entity  or b in cases where the equity investors lack one or more of the essential characteristics of a controlling financial interest  which include the ability to make decisions about the entity s activities through voting rights  the obligations to absorb the expected losses of the entity if they occur  or the right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity if they occur 
management has evaluated the company s investments in variable interest entities and potential variable interest entities or transactions  particularly in limited liability partnerships involved in low income housing development and trust preferred securities structures 
the implementation of fin did not have a significant impact on either the company s consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations 
interpretive guidance relating to fin is continuing to evolve and the company s management will continue to assess various aspects of consolidations and variable interest entity accounting as additional guidance becomes available 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the statement amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the statement is effective for contracts entered into or modified after june   with certain exceptions  and for hedging relationships designated after june  and is not expected to have an impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
this statement establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability or an asset in some circumstances 
many of these instruments were previously classified as equity 
this statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june   except for mandatory redeemable financial instruments of nonpublic entities 
adoption of the statement did not result in an impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in november  the fasb s emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on a new disclosure requirement related to unrealized losses on investment securities 
the new disclosure requires a table of securities which have unrealized losses as of the reporting date 
the table must distinguish between those securities which have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for twelve months or more and those securities which have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for less than twelve months 
the table is to include the aggregate unrealized losses of securities whose fair values are below book values as of the reporting date  and the aggregate fair value of securities whose fair values are below book values as of the reporting date 
in addition to the quantitative disclosure  fasb requires a narrative discussion that provides sufficient information to allow financial statement users to understand the quantitative disclosures and the information that was considered in determining whether impairment was not other than temporary 
the new disclosure requirements apply to fiscal years ending after december  the company has included the required disclosures in their consolidated financial statements 

table of contents in december  the fasb issued a revised version of sfas no 
 employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits an amendment of fasb statements no 
 and this statement revises employers disclosures about pension plans and other postretirement benefits 
it does not change the measurement or recognition of those plans required by fasb statements no 
 no 
 and no 
this statement retains the disclosure requirements contained in the original fasb statement no 
 which it replaces 
however  it requires additional disclosures to those in the original statement about the assets  obligations  cash flows  and net periodic benefit costs of defined benefit pension plans and other defined benefit postretirement plans 
the required information should be provided separately for pension plans and for other postretirement benefit plans 
the disclosures for earlier annual periods presented for comparative purposes are required to be restated for a the percentages of each major category of plan assets held  b the accumulated benefit obligation  and c the assumptions used in the accounting for the plans 
this statement is effective for financial statements with fiscal years ending after december  the interim period disclosures required by this statement are effective for interim periods beginning after december  the company has included the required disclosures in its consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments due to changes in interest rates  exchange rates and equity prices 
evb s market risk is composed primarily of interest rate risk 
the company s management is responsible for reviewing the interest rate sensitivity position of evb s subsidiary banks and establishing policies to monitor and limit exposure to interest rate risk 
guidelines established by management are reviewed by the board of directors 
it is evb s policy not to engage in activities considered to be derivative in nature such as futures  option contracts  swaps  caps  floors  collars or forward commitments 
evb considers derivatives as speculative which is contrary to the company s historical or prospective philosophy 
evb does not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
it does not hold in its loan and security portfolio investments that adjust or float according to changes in the prime lending rate which is not considered speculative  but necessary for good asset liability management 
asset liability risk management the primary goals of asset liability risk management are to maximize net interest income and the net value of evb s future cash flows within the interest rate limits set by the asset liability committee alco 
interest rate risk measurement interest rate risk is monitored through the use of three complimentary measures  static gap analysis  earnings simulation modeling and net present value estimation 
while each of the interest rate risk measurements has limitations  taken together they represent a reasonably comprehensive view of the magnitude of interest rate risk in the company  the distribution of risk along the yield curve  the level of risk through time  and the amount of exposure to changes in certain interest rate relationships 
static gap gap analysis measures the amount of repricing risk embedded in the balance sheet at a point in time 
it does so by comparing the differences in the repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities 
a gap is defined as the difference between the principal amount of assets and liabilities  adjusted for off balance sheet instruments  which reprice within a specific time period 
the cumulative one year gap  at year end was which is within the policy limit for the one year gap of plus to minus of total earning assets at a combined company level 

table of contents core deposits and loans with noncontractual maturities are included in the gap repricing distributions based upon historical patterns determined by statistical analysis  based upon industry accepted assumptions including the most recent core deposit defaults set forth by the ffiec federal financial institutions examination council 
the gap repricing distributions include principal cash flows from residential mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities in the time frames in which they are expected to be received 
mortgage prepayments are estimated by applying industry median projections of prepayment speeds to portfolio segments based on coupon range and loan age 
earnings simulation the earnings simulation model forecasts one year net income under a variety of scenarios that incorporate changes in the absolute level of interest rates  changes in the shape of the yield curve and changes in interest rate relationships 
management evaluates the effects on income of alternative interest rate scenarios against earnings in a stable interest rate environment 
this type of analysis is also most useful in determining the short run earnings exposures to changes in customer behavior involving loan payments and deposit additions and withdrawals 
the most recent earnings simulation model projects net income would decrease approximately of stable rate net income if rates were to fall immediately by two percentage points 
it projects a decrease of approximately if rates rise by two percentage points 
management believes this reflects a liability sensitive interest risk for the one year horizon 
this dynamic simulation model includes assumptions about how the balance sheet is likely to evolve through time  in different interest rate environments 
loan and deposit growth rate assumptions are derived from historical analysis and management s outlook  as are the assumptions used to project yields and rates for new loans and deposits 
all maturities  calls and prepayments in the securities portfolio are assumed to be reinvested in like instruments 
mortgage loan prepayment assumptions are developed from industry median estimates of prepayment speeds for portfolios with similar coupon ranges and seasoning 
noncontractual deposit growth rates and pricing are assumed to follow historical patterns 
the sensitivities of key assumptions are analyzed at least annually and reviewed by management 
net present value the net present value npv of the balance sheet  at a point in time  is defined as the discounted present value of asset cash flows minus the discounted value of liability cash flows 
interest rate risk analysis using npv involves changing the interest rates used in determining the cash flows and in discounting the cash flows 
the resulting percentage change in npv is an indication of the longer term repricing risk and options embedded in the balance sheet 
at year end  a basis point immediate increase in rates is estimated to decrease npv by 
additionally  npv is estimated to increase by if rates fall immediately by basis points 
analysis of the average quarterly change in the treasury yield curve over the past ten years indicates that a parallel curve shift of basis points or more is an event that has less that a chance of occurrence 
as with gap analysis and earnings simulation modeling  assumptions about the timing and variability of balance sheet cash flows are critical in npv analysis 
particularly important are the assumptions driving mortgage prepayments and the assumptions about expected attrition of the core deposit portfolios 
these assumptions are applied consistently across the different rate risk measures

stable rate the earnings simulation model indicates that if all prepayments  calls and maturities of the securities portfolios expected over the next year were to remain uninvested  then the current liability sensitive position would be lessened 
management projects interest rates to remain stable during most of and believes that the current level of liability sensitivity is appropriate
