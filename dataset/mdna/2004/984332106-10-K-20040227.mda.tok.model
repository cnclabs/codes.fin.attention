we believe the following critical accounting estimates are affected by more significant judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition  valuation allowances  specifically the allowance for doubtful accounts and deferred tax assets  accounting for investments in private and publicly traded securities  and goodwill and other intangible asset impairment 
revenue recognition 
our revenues are primarily generated from the sale of rich media advertisements banner and other media advertisements  sponsorship  and text link advertisements  including pay for performance search advertisements  paid inclusion and algorithmic searches  transactions revenue  and revenue generated from a variety of consumer and business fee and listings based services 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  the recognition of these revenues is partly based on our assessment of the probability of collection of the resulting accounts receivable balance 
as a result  the timing or amount of revenue recognition may have been different if different assessments of the probability of collection of accounts receivable had been made at the time the transactions were recorded in revenue 
valuation allowances 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would likely increase stockholders equity as substantially all of our net operating losses result from employee stock option deductions 
accounting for investments in private and publicly traded securities 
we hold equity interests in companies  some of which are publicly traded and have highly volatile share prices 
we record an investment impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is judged to be other than temporary 
we monitor our investments for impairment by considering current factors including economic environment  market conditions and the operational performance and other specific factors relating to the business underlying the investment 
future adverse changes in these factors could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
we recorded approximately million of impairments on the carrying value of equity securities during goodwill and other intangible assets 
our long lived assets include goodwill and other intangible assets 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level operating segment or one level below an operating segment on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances 
application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment  including the identification of reporting units  assigning assets and liabilities to reporting units  assigning goodwill to reporting units  and determining the fair value of each reporting unit 
significant judgments required to estimate the fair value of reporting units include estimating future cash flows  determining appropriate discount rates and other assumptions 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit 
effective january   we adopted sfas and performed a transitional test of our goodwill and intangible assets 
due to  among other things  the overall softening of the global economy and the related decline in international advertising  the company recorded a goodwill impairment loss of million  which was recorded during the first quarter of as a cumulative effect of an accounting change in the company s consolidated financial statements 
the fair value of the reporting unit giving rise to the transitional impairment loss was estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows 
any further impairment losses recorded in the future could have a material adverse impact on our financial conditions and results of operations 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  requires that we record an impairment charge on finite lived intangibles or long lived assets to be held and used when we determine that the carrying value of intangible assets and long lived assets may not be recoverable 
based on the existence of one or more indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment of intangibles or long lived assets based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our business model 
our estimates of cash flows require significant judgment based on our historical results and anticipated results and are subject to many factors 
the company performed its annual assessment of goodwill and other intangible assets in and  and concluded that there were no additional impairments 
recent accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
fin consolidation of variable interest entities 
until this interpretation  a company generally included another entity in its consolidated financial statements only if it controlled the entity through voting interests 
fin requires a variable interest entity  as defined  to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns 
certain provisions of fin were deferred until the period ending after march  the adoption of fin for provisions effective during did not have a material impact on the company s financial position  cash flows or results of operations 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  which amends sfas for certain decisions made by the fasb derivatives implementation group 
in particular  sfas clarifies under what circumstances a contract with an initial net investment meets the characteristic of a derivative  clarifies when a derivative contains a financing component  amends the definition of an underlying to conform it to language used in fasb interpretation no 
guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  and amends certain other existing pronouncements 
this statement is effective for contracts entered into or modified after june   and for hedging relationships designated after june  in addition  most provisions of sfas are to be applied prospectively 
the adoption of sfas did not have a material impact on the company s financial position  cash flows or results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas 
sfas changes the accounting for certain financial instruments that under previous guidance issuers could account for as equity 
it requires that those instruments be classified as liabilities in balance sheets 
the guidance in sfas is generally effective for all financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective on july  the adoption of sfas did not have a material impact on the company s financial position  cash flows or results of operations

during july  the company exercised its right  pursuant to the master lease agreement to acquire the complex for approximately million  which was funded by the restricted long term investments 
we have entered into various non cancelable operating lease agreements for our other offices throughout the united states and for our international subsidiaries for original lease periods ranging from six months to years and expiring between and in addition  we have entered into various sublease arrangements associated with our excess facilities under the restructuring programs 
such subleases have terms extending through and amounts estimated to be received have been included in determining the restructuring accrual 
net lease commitments as of december  can be summarized as follows in millions years ending december  gross lease commitments sublease income net lease commitments due after years total net lease commitments other commitments in the ordinary course of business  we enter into various arrangements with vendors and other business partners  principally for marketing  bandwidth and content arrangements 
there are no material commitments for these arrangements extending beyond in connection with our commercial agreements  we provide indemnifications of varying scope and terms to customers  business partners and other parties with respect to certain matters  including  but not limited to  losses arising out of our breach of such agreements and out of intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties 
in addition  we have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and certain of our officers that will require us  among other things  to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers 
we maintain director and officer insurance  which may cover certain liabilities arising from our obligation to indemnify our directors and officers in certain circumstances 
the indemnification provided by us to our officers and directors does not have a stipulated maximum  therefore we are not able to develop a reasonable estimate of the maximum liabilities 
to date  we have not incurred material costs as a result of such obligations and have not accrued any liabilities related to such indemnification obligations in our financial statements 
we continue to increase capital expenditures and operating lease commitments  which is consistent with our increased staffing and operational expansion  and we anticipate that this will continue in the future as business conditions merit 
additionally  we will continue to evaluate possible acquisitions of  or investments in businesses  products  and technologies that are complementary to our business  which may require the use of cash 
management believes existing cash and investments will be sufficient to meet operating requirements for at least the next twelve months  however  we may sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain credit facilities to further enhance our liquidity position beyond the sale of additional securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
on april   overture completed its purchase of the web search unit of fast search and transfer asa  a norway based developer of search and real time filtering technologies  for million in cash  plus a contingent earn out payment of up to million over three years based on specified operating criteria

the company is obligated to make payments under contracts to provide search services to its affiliates  which represents traffic acquisition costs 
at december  and  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as such  we are not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes  foreign currency fluctuations  and changes in the market values of our investments 
interest rate risk 
our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we have not used derivative financial instruments to hedge our investment portfolio 
we invest excess cash in debt instruments of the us government and its agencies  and in high quality corporate issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we protect and preserve invested funds by limiting default  market and reinvestment risk 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
as of december   we had investments in debt securities with maturities between three months and one year of approximately million 
such investments had a weighted average yield of approximately percent 
investments in debt securities with maturities between one and five years of approximately billion had a weighted average yield of approximately percent 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would result in approximately million decrease approximately one percent in the fair value of our available for sale securities at december  the fair market value of our zero coupon senior convertible notes is subject to interest rate risk 
generally  the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
the interest changes affect the fair market value but do not impact our financial position  cash flows  or results of operations 
as of december   the fair value of the zero coupon senior convertible notes was approximately million based on quoted market prices 
foreign currency risk 
international revenues from our foreign subsidiaries accounted for approximately percent of total revenues during international sales are made mostly from our foreign sales subsidiaries in their respective countries and are typically denominated in the local currency of each country 
these subsidiaries also incur most of their expenses in the local currency 
accordingly  all foreign subsidiaries use the local currency as their functional currency 
our international business is subject to risks  including  but not limited to differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange rate volatility when compared to the united states 
accordingly  our future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors 
our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations arises in part from intercompany accounts in which costs incurred in the united states are charged to our foreign sales subsidiaries 
these intercompany accounts are typically denominated in the functional currency of the foreign subsidiary 
we are also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars in consolidation 
as exchange rates vary  these results  when translated  may vary from expectations and adversely impact overall expected profitability 
the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations for was not material 
investment risk 
we have invested in equity instruments of privately held companies for business and strategic purposes 
these investments are included in other long term assets and are accounted for under the cost method when ownership is less than percent and we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over operations 
since our initial investment  certain of these investments in privately held companies have become marketable equity securities upon the investees completing initial public offerings 
such investments are subject to significant fluctuations in fair market value due to the volatility of the stock market and are recorded as long term investments 
for these investments in public and privately held companies  our policy is to monitor these investments for impairment by considering current factors including economic environment  market conditions and operational performance and other specific factors relating to the business underlying the investment  and record reductions in carrying value when necessary 
an impairment in the carrying value of our privately held investments of percent would result in a decrease in the carrying value of our privately held investments of approximately million 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents  short term and long term investments in a variety of securities  including both government and corporate obligations and money market funds 
as of december  the net unrealized gains on these investments were not material 
we are exposed to market risk as it relates to changes in the market value of our investments 
we invest in equity instruments of public companies  certain of which may be classified as derivatives  for business and strategic purposes and have classified these securities as available for sale 
these available for sale equity investments are subject to significant fluctuations in fair value due to the volatility of the stock market and the industries in which these companies participate 
we have realized gains and losses from both the sale of investments  as well as mergers and acquisitions of companies in which we have invested 
as of december   we had available for sale equity investments with a fair value of approximately million and a cost basis of approximately million 
the net unrealized gains have been recorded net of deferred taxes as a separate component of stockholders equity and gains on derivatives of approximately million have been recorded in other income on the statement of operations 
our objective in managing exposure to stock market fluctuations is to minimize the impact of stock market declines to earnings and cash flows 
however  continued market volatility  as well as mergers and acquisitions  have the potential to have a material non cash impact on our operating results in future periods
