recent developments cbiz is focused on acquiring businesses that will complement its service offerings in those primary markets where cbiz already has a significant presence 
during  cbiz acquired benefits and insurance operations located in boca raton  florida  and salt lake city  utah 
the company also acquired an accounting  tax and advisory operations in orange county  california  and acquired harborview partners  a firm specializing in internal audit services  located in stamford  connecticut 
before acquiring harborview partners  cbiz had an arrangement to be the exclusive provider of professional staff to the firm 
cbiz continues to rationalize and sharpen the focus of its operations by divesting or closing non core and non performing units 
during  twelve operations were divested  six of which were classified as discontinued operations in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the operations not meeting the criteria for treatment as discontinued operations have been accounted for as gain loss on divested operations from continuing operations in the accompanying statements of operations 
cbiz will continue to divest those non strategic businesses that are either under performing  are located in secondary markets  or that do not provide the level of synergistic cross serving opportunities with other cbiz businesses that is desired 
additional gains or losses may be incurred as future transactions are completed 
during the third quarter of  cbiz acquired approximately million shares of its common stock through a modified dutch auction tender offer 
these shares were purchased at per share  for a total cost  including expenses  of approximately million  and are currently carried as treasury stock 
results of operations continuing operations comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  operating practice groups cbiz currently delivers products and services through three practice groups 
below is a brief description of these groups operating results and factors affecting their businesses 
the services offered under each of these groups are described in part i of this report 
accounting  tax and advisory services 
the ata group contributed approximately million and million of revenue  or approximately and of cbiz s annual revenue in and  respectively 
the decrease in revenue of million was a result of divestitures and the transfer of certain technology businesses to the national practices group during  offset by organic growth 
divestitures  net of acquisitions  resulted in a net decline in revenue of million in the transfer of certain technology business from ata to national practices in january resulted in a decrease in revenue of million 
for ata businesses with a full period of operations for the years ended december  and excluding acquisitions  divestitures and transfers  revenue increased million or 
gross margins decreased from in to in primarily due to increased compensation and benefits costs that rose at a rate higher than revenue 
cbiz expects its ata services group to achieve modest revenue growth  as well as improvement in gross margin in improvements in staff utilization  as well as the acquisition of harborview partners and related opportunities with sarbanes oxley compliance and consulting  a new product offering to provide diagnostic information to clients regarding their financial condition  and modest billing rate increases are expected to contribute to such growth and margin improvement 
the economic environment is expected to improve in  which will offer opportunities for additional discretionary work 
benefits and insurance services 
the benefits and insurance group contributed approximately million and million of revenue  or approximately and of cbiz s annual revenue in and  respectively 
the increase in revenue is attributable to organic growth  including larger bonuses from insurance carriers  as well as acquisitions 
revenue increased million due to acquisitions  offset by the decrease in revenue related to divestitures completed during the year ended december  of million 
for benefits and insurance businesses with a full period of operations for the years ended december  and  same unit revenue increased million  or 
the gross margin increased from in to in cbiz benefits and insurance group continued to benefit in from increasing group benefits premium rates 
in addition  the worksite marketing business experienced significant revenue growth due to an increasing number of new clients 
the life insurance business also experienced revenue growth through the sale of several large life cases and special risk insurance cases  combined with bank owned life insurance placements related to one major carrier 
cbiz expects revenue and margin growth to continue in  but may not be able to sustain the levels of organic growth achieved during  based on the number of large cases placed that may not recur in future periods 
national practices services 
the national practices group contributed approximately million and million of revenue  or approximately of cbiz s annual revenue in and  respectively 
included in the results of the national practices group are those of cbiz mmp  which contributed approximately million and million  or and  of cbiz s annual revenue in and  respectively 
this growth of is attributable to the addition of new clients  including the expansion into new markets  such as the entrance into the colorado market 
revenue for cbiz mmp is based on a percentage of amounts collected for their clients 
the gross margin increased from in to in cbiz mmp invested capital dollars in systems and new technologies in in order to accommodate future growth 
these systems are planned to be operational in although cbiz expects growth in revenue of cbiz mmp to continue  due to investments in systems and technologies and the start up costs incurred for opening new offices  we cannot assure that gross margin growth will continue at the levels experienced in recent years 
the other units within national practices  excluding cbiz mmp  contributed approximately million and million of revenue in and  respectively 
approximately million of the decrease in revenue was related to the lack of transactions in cbiz s mergers and acquisition group cbiz m a  as compared to  in which one significant transaction closed in the fourth quarter 
while cbiz endeavors to find transactions of this nature in our mergers and acquisition business  we are not able to predict the timing or amount of these types of transactions  nor are we able to determine if they will continue in the future 
in addition to the decrease in cbiz m a s revenue  the valuation  property tax and information technology it businesses suffered from decreased revenue in primarily due to rationalization of certain unproductive offices and business lines 
gross margins for other national practices decreased from in to in also due primarily to the decision to close certain unproductive offices and discontinue certain product lines within the property tax  mergers and acquisitions  and it businesses 
although gross margins have declined in the last two years  cbiz expects modest growth in revenue and a positive gross margin for the other national practices in due to an improving environment in it consulting and growth in the payroll business

the value of these investments is influenced by many factors  including the operating effectiveness of these companies  the overall health of the companies industries  the strength of the private equity markets and general market conditions 
during  cbiz recorded charges of approximately million related to the impairment of certain investments held 
although the market value of these investments is not readily determinable  management believes their current fair values approximate their carrying values as of december  in light of the circumstances noted above  particularly with respect to the current economic environment  it is possible that the fair value of these investments could decline in future periods  and further impairment could occur 
at december   cbiz has one remaining investment valued at approximately million 
loss contingencies loss contingencies  including litigation claims  are recorded as liabilities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
contingent liabilities are often resolved over long time periods 
estimating probable losses requires analysis that often depends on judgment about potential actions by third parties 
estimates of incentive compensation costs and effective income tax rates incentive compensation costs and income tax expense are two significant expense categories that are highly dependent upon management estimates and judgments  particularly at each interim reporting date 
in arriving at the amount of expense to recognize  management believes it makes reasonable estimates and judgments using all significant information available 
incentive compensation costs are accrued on a monthly basis  and the ultimate determination is made after our year end results are finalized  thus  estimates are subject to change 
circumstances that could cause our estimates of effective income tax rates to change include the impact of information that subsequently became available as we prepared our corporate income tax returns  the level of actual pre tax income  revisions to tax positions taken as a result of further analysis and consultation  and changes mandated as a result of audits by taxing authorities 
other significant policies other significant accounting policies not involving the same level of measurement uncertainties as those discussed above are nevertheless important to understanding the consolidated financial statements 
those policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements contained herein 
new accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
fin 
fin addresses conditions for consolidating an entity based on variable interests as defined in the standard rather than voting interests 
fin clarifies that variable interest entities that do not disperse risks among the parties involved should be consolidated by the entity that is determined to be the primary beneficiary 
fin applied immediately to variable interest entities created after january  for variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that was acquired before february   fin originally had to be adopted no later than the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june  however  in october  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp e  effective date of interpretation fsp e deferred the effective date for applying the provisions of fin  for interests held by public entities in variable interest entities created before february   until the end of the first interim or annual period ending after december  in december  the fasb issued a revision to fin fin r to clarify some of the provisions of fin and to exempt certain entities from its requirements 
under fin r  special effective date provisions apply to enterprises that have fully or partially applied fin prior to issuance of fin r 
otherwise  application of fin r is required in financial statements of public entities that have interests in structures that are commonly referred to as special purpose entities for periods ending after december  cbiz has evaluated fin  fsp e and fin r and determined that its relationship with certain certified public accounting firms with whom we maintain administrative service agreements  may qualify as variable interest entities 
the accompanying financial statements do not reflect the consolidation of the variable interest entities  as the impact is immaterial and as consolidation does not add material information 
if the activities of the entities had been consolidated  selected financial data would be as follows year ended december  as reported pro forma revenue   operating expenses   gross margin   operating income   minority share of operating income  net income from continuing operations   net income   other data total assets   total liabilities   minority interest  total equity   total service fees recognized as revenue in the accompanying statement of operations under the administrative services agreements asas was approximately million during the year ended december  net assets related to the asas and recorded in the accompanying statement of position as of december  are approximately million
