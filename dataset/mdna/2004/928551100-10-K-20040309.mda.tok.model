overview vivus  inc is a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the research  development and commercialization of products to restore sexual function in men and women 
in addition to its currently marketed therapies  vivus has a pipeline that includes both new chemical entities and existing compounds that are being developed to address unmet medical needs 
vivus business strategy is to apply its scientific and medical expertise to identify  develop and commercialize therapies that restore sexual function 
in the united states  vivus markets muse alprostadil and actis  two products for the treatment of erectile dysfunction 
we have entered into supply agreements with meda ab stockholm medaa 
st to market and distribute muse and actis in all member states of the european union  the baltic states  the czech republic  hungary  iceland  norway  poland  switzerland and turkey 
in canada  we have entered into a license and supply agreement with paladin labs  inc tse plb for the marketing and distribution of muse 
we currently have four significant research and development programs in progress targeting male and female sexual function alista to treat female sexual arousal disorder  estradiol mdts  a therapy for women experiencing symptoms associated with menopause  testosterone mdts for treating women with low sexual desire  and avanafil  formerly known as ta  for the treatment of erectile dysfunction 
the first two programs are in phase clinical development and the second two are in phase clinical development 
we believe that each of these programs addresses either established markets with sales in excess of billion annually or potential markets with sales that could exceed billion annually 
we made progress in our development programs in our first phase clinical study to evaluate the safety of and response to alista  our product for the treatment of female sexual arousal disorder  was successfully completed and demonstrated a significant increase versus placebo and baseline in sexual response 
we filed an investigational new drug application to initiate a clinical study to evaluate the safety and erectile response to oral avanafil in men with erectile dysfunction 
prescriptions for muse in the united states increased by in the last six months of  as compared to the first six months of our development programs continued in an expanded phase study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of alista when used by women with female sexual arousal disorder at home with their partner began in the first quarter of and dosing was completed in february we completed a single dose trial to evaluate the safety of and erectile response to oral avanafil in men with erectile dysfunction 
clinical data from this study demonstrated that avanafil was capable of restoring penile function in men with erectile dysfunction 
we also began pre clinical development work on a transurethral formulation of avanafil  alone and in combination with alprostadil  for the treatment of erectile dysfunction 
vivus cash and cash equivalents decreased by million during we signed an international supply agreement with meda ab for the marketing of muse internationally 
united states muse sales units increased over levels 
in  we strengthened our cash position to support upcoming clinical trials by completing a private placement of  shares of common stock for aggregate net proceeds of million 
our cash position also increased by an additional million as a result of the resolution in the third quarter of our arbitration claim against janssen pharmacuetica international with the american arbitration association 
although united states muse sales units declined from levels  international sales units increased during  resulting in equivalent product revenue in as compared to the results of our expanded phase alista study discussed previously demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in satisfactory sexual arousal and or orgasm in postmenopausal women who were treated with the mcg dose of alista 
we initiated a second at home clinical study for alista designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of alista when used at home by pre menopausal women with female sexual arousal disorder 
in july  we began enrolling patients in an at home  prospective  randomized  double blind  direct comparator clinical trial to evaluate the safety  efficacy  and onset of action of avanafil versus viagra in men with erectile dysfunction 
subjects in the clinical trial had erections sufficient to achieve vaginal penetration on approximately of the attempts with both avanafil and viagra 
the attempts with both products occurred within an average of minutes of dosing 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to product returns  doubtful accounts  income taxes  restructuring  inventories and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
product returns we record reserves for anticipated returns of expired or damaged product in the united states 
we follow this method since reasonably dependable estimates of product returns can be made based on historical experience and our monitoring of inventory levels in the wholesale distribution channel 
revisions in returns estimates are charged to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
there is no right of return on product sold internationally subsequent to shipment  thus no returns reserve is needed 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances could be required 
income taxes we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
for all periods presented  we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
we have also recorded income taxes payable for estimated current tax liabilities 
we monitor these estimated liabilities and adjust them as conditions warrant 
restructuring in  we experienced a significant restructuring and recorded restructuring related reserves for severance and employee costs  inventory obsolescence  raw material purchase commitments  property and related commitments  marketing commitments and other commitments 
we monitor the adequacy of these liabilities and have made periodic adjustments as conditions have changed 
inventories we record inventory reserves for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
during the quarter ended september   the company established significant reserves against its inventory to align with new estimates of expected future demand for muse 
the company had built up its inventory level prior to and after the launch of viagra and had not anticipated the impact that viagra would have on the demand for muse 
as of december   the remaining inventory reserve balance is million 
this remaining balance is related to the raw materials inventory that the company previously estimated would not be used 
some portion of the fully reserved inventory will now be used in production 
to the extent that this inventory is used in production  it will be charged to cost of goods sold at a zero basis  which will have a favorable impact on gross profit 
available for sale securities available for sale securities represent investments in debt securities that are stated at fair value 
we restrict our cash investments to direct obligations of the united states treasury  federal agency securities which carry the direct or implied guarantee of the united states government  and corporate securities  including commercial paper  rated a p or better 
the difference between amortized cost cost adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts which are recognized as adjustments to interest income and fair value  representing unrealized holding gains or losses  are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss income  a separate component of stockholders equity until realized 
the company s policy is to record investments in debt securities as available for sale because the sale of such securities may be required prior to maturity 
any gains and losses on the sale of debt securities are determined on a specific identification basis and are included in interest and other income in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
available for sale securities with original maturities beyond one year from the balance sheet date are classified as non current 
contingencies and litigation we are periodically involved in disputes and litigation related to a variety of matters 
when it is probable that we will experience a loss  and that loss is quantifiable  we record appropriate reserves 
results of operations years ended december  and for the year ended december   the company reported a net loss of  or net loss per share as compared to a net loss of million or net loss per share for the year ended december  the decrease in the net loss in is due primarily to revenue recognized as the result of the resolution of our arbitration claim against janssen pharmaceutica in the third quarter of reduced operating expenses also contributed to the lower loss 
the company anticipates losses over the next several years 
the company generally does not expect increases in muse sales  and the company will continue to invest in clinical development of its current research and development pipeline in an attempt to bring those potential products to market 
revenue 
united states product revenue for the year ended december  was million  as compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the number of muse units sold in versus international revenue was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in higher international product revenue in was due to a full year of sales to our international distribution partner  meda 
initial shipments to meda began in the fourth quarter of other revenue was million due to the resolution of the company s arbitration claim against janssen pharmaceutica with the american arbitration association related to payments owing to vivus under a previously terminated distribution agreement between the companies 
million represents amounts due from janssen pharmaceutica under the arbitration award 
the remaining million results from recognizing janssen pharmaceutica related revenue that was previously deferred pending the outcome of the arbitration 
in and  the charge for actual and anticipated returns of product was million and million  respectively 
the decrease in was due to lower united states revenue as discussed above 
product return data through the first quarter of indicated an increase to the returns reserve was warranted 
approximately  of the returns provision recorded in reflects the required increase to the product returns liability for sales made from january through december the charge for actual and anticipated returns was increased to of united states gross sales as of january cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the same period in during  we used certain raw material inventory  the cost basis of which had been reduced to zero in prior years

adjusting for these items  comparative gross margins  excluding other revenue from the calculation  for the twelve months ended december  versus were and  respectively 
the slight decline in margins year over year was attributable to an increase in international sales in which carried lower margins than united states sales 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million  million lower than the same period in the previous year 
the decrease is due to greater clinical trial activity in as compared to the company currently does not expect to recognize revenues from sales of any new products being developed through research and development efforts until at the earliest 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million  compared to million in the year ended december  the decrease is primarily due to the reimbursement in by janssen pharmaceutica of legal fees and other expenses totaling  related to the janssen pharmaceutica arbitration that were previously expensed in interest income 
interest income for the year ended december  was  as compared to million for the year ended december  despite the increase in our investments  lower interest rates contributed to the reduction in interest income

in  we recorded a tax benefit of  based on an updated estimate of our net tax liabilities as well as filing for a refund of previously paid alternative minimum taxes which became available due to a tax law change 
years ended december  and for the year ended december   the company reported a net loss of million  or net loss per share as compared to a net loss of million  or a net loss per share for the year ended december  lower international revenue  decreased interest income and spending for research and development contributed to the higher loss in revenue 
united states product revenue for the year ended december  was million  as compared to million for the year ended december  approximately  of the increase to united states revenue was attributable to a price increase vivus implemented at the end of march the remainder of the increase was due to a increase in the number of muse units sold in versus international revenue was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in lower international product revenue in was due to a decrease in product demand by our previous international distributor in anticipation of the transition to our distribution partner  meda ab 
in and  the charge for actual and anticipated returns of product was million and million  respectively

approximately  of the returns provision recorded in reflects the required increase to the product returns liability for sales made from january through december the charge for actual and anticipated returns was increased to of united states gross sales as of january cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the same period in the amount includes a reduction in cost of goods sold of  as a result of settlements of previously recognized purchase commitment liabilities for our major raw material  alprostadil 
adjusting for this item  comparative gross margins for the twelve months ended december  versus were and  respectively 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million  million higher than the same period in the previous year  which included a million payment to tanabe seiyaku for licensing the proprietary compound avanafil  formerly known as ta if not for this million expense  research and development costs in would have been million higher than the same period in due to increased expenditures for clinical development of our current pipeline 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million  compared to million in the year ended december  the increase is due to increased investment in united states sales and marketing efforts and legal expenses relating to the janssen pharmaceutica arbitration hearing 
interest income 
interest income for the year ended december  was million as compared to million in the year ended december  the million reduction in cash and lower interest rates contributed to the reduction in interest income 
income before taxes 
we recorded a tax benefit of  for based on an updated estimate of our net tax liabilities as well as filing for a refund of previously paid alternative minimum taxes which became available due to a tax law change 
in  we recorded a tax benefit of million based on an updated estimate of net tax liabilities 
liquidity and capital resources cash 
unrestricted cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities totaled million at december   compared with million at december  the increase during was primarily due to the net proceeds of million from the sale of our common stock in a private placement in may additionally  vivus received million of cash in november as a result of the resolution of our arbitration claim against janssen pharmaceutica 
the million consisted of million for manufactured inventory and lost profits  and  for legal fees and other related expenses 
since inception  we have financed operations primarily from the issuance of equity securities 
through december   vivus raised million from financing activities and had an accumulated deficit of million 
available for sale securities 
the company focuses on liquidity and capital preservation in its investments in available for sale securities 
the company restricts its cash investments to direct obligations of the united states treasury  federal agency securities which carry the direct or implied guarantee of the united states government  and corporate securities  including commercial paper  rated a p or better 
the company sequences the maturities of its investments consistent with its cash forecasts 
the weighted average maturity of the portfolio is not to exceed months 
as investments mature  the company re invests the money by purchasing additional securities 
as the company needs cash for its operating expenses  it sells such investment securities 
because the company sequences maturities consistent with its cash forecasts  realized gains and losses on the sales of securities are typically insignificant 
accounts receivable 
accounts receivable net of allowance for doubtful accounts at december  was million  as compared to million at december  the decrease in the accounts receivable balance at december  is due to a decrease in the number of units sold in december as compared to december currently  the company does not have any significant concerns related to accounts receivable or collections 
liabilities 
total liabilities were million at december   compared with million at december  accounts payable increased million primarily due to a shipment of alprostadil received in mid december 
accrued liabilities decreased million due to recognizing janssen pharmacuetica related revenue that was previously deferred pending the outcome of the arbitration and by  due to a decrease in research and clinical activities during these decreases were offset slightly by an overall  increase in the product returns liability due to less product being returned during operating activities 
our operating activities provided million of cash during the twelve months ended december  and used million of cash during the twelve months ended december  the cash provided in can be attributed to a million decrease in our accounts receivable balance and million of non cash depreciation expense included in our  net loss  offset by an increase in our inventories due to the purchase of million worth of alprostadil 
in  operating expenses  particularly research and development expenses  were higher than revenues from product sales accounting for the use of cash 
investing activities 
net cash used for investing activities was million during the twelve months ended december  this related primarily to the investment of the proceeds from our private placement of stock 
net cash provided by investing activities was million for the same period in as we used invested funds to offset cash used in operations 
financing activities 
financing activities provided cash of million and  during the years ended december  and  respectively 
these amounts include the proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the sale of stock under our employee stock purchase plan in both and additionally  during the second quarter of  vivus completed a private placement of  shares of common stock for aggregate net proceeds of million 
the shares of common stock were sold at per share  an approximate discount to the five day trailing average ended may  we anticipate that our existing capital resources combined with anticipated future cash flows will be sufficient to support our operating needs for at least the coming year 
however  we anticipate that we will be required to obtain additional financing to fund the development of our research and development pipeline in future periods as well as to support the possible launch of any future products 
in particular  other substantial payments will be made in accordance with the agreement for licensing from acrux ltd 
and for licensing the compound avanafil  formerly known as ta these payments are based on certain development  regulatory and sales milestones 
in addition  royalty payments would be required on any future product sales 
we expect to evaluate potential financing sources  including  but not limited to  the issuance of additional equity or debt securities  corporate alliances  joint ventures  and licensing agreements to fund the development and possible commercial launch of any future products 
the sale of additional equity securities would result in additional dilution to vivus stockholders 
our working capital and additional funding requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including the progress of our research and development programs  the timing and results of pre clinical testing and clinical trials  results of operations  demand for muse  technological advances  the level of resources that we devote to our sales and marketing capabilities  and the activities of competitors

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the securities and exchange commission s rule related to market risk disclosure requires that we describe and quantify our potential losses from market risk sensitive instruments attributable to reasonably possible market changes 
market risk sensitive instruments include all financial or commodity instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to future changes in interest rates  currency exchange rates  commodity prices or other market factors 
vivus is not exposed to market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates or commodity prices 
we do not hold derivative financial instruments nor do we hold securities for trading or speculative purposes 
at december  and  we had no debt outstanding  and consequently vivus currently has no risk exposure associated with increasing interest rates 
vivus  however  is exposed to changes in interest rates on our investments in cash equivalents and available for sale securities 
a significant portion of all of our investments in cash equivalents and available for sale securities are in money market funds that hold short term investment grade commercial paper  treasury bills or other united states government obligations 
currently  this reduces our exposure to long term interest rate changes
