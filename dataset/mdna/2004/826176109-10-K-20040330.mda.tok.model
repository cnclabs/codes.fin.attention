the economy has improved in the last nine months of to offset the weak market conditions in the first quarter the improvement in the last nine months appears to be due in part to the continued low interest rate environment  renewed interest in the equity markets and the end of major combat in operation iraqi freedom after the first quarter consequently  trading activity increased for the company  as well as for the entire discount brokerage industry 
competition continued to intensify among all types of brokerage firms  including established discount brokers and new firms entering the on line brokerage business 
electronic trading continues to account for an increasing amount of trading activity  with some firms offering very low flat rate trading execution fees that are difficult for any conventional discount firm to meet 
some of these flat fee brokers  however  impose fees for services such as mailing  transfers and handling exchanges which the company does not currently impose  and also direct their executions to captive market makers 
continued competition could limit the company s growth or even lead to a decline in the company s customer base  which would adversely affect its results of operations 
industry wide changes in trading practices  such as the advent of decimal pricing and the increasing use of electronic communications networks  are expected to put continuing pressure on fees earned by discount brokers while increasing volatility 
on may   the board of directors of the company authorized a buy back of up to one million shares of the company s common stock 
under this program  shares are purchased from time to time  at the company s discretion  in the open market and in private transactions 
through february    shares have been purchased at an average price of per share 
the company  like other securities firms  is directly affected by general economic and market conditions including fluctuations in volume and prices of securities  changes and the prospect of changes in interest rates  and demand for brokerage and investment banking services  all of which can affect the company s profitability 
in addition  in periods of reduced financial market activity  profitability is likely to be adversely affected because certain expenses remain relatively fixed  including salaries and related costs  portions of communications costs and occupancy expenses 
accordingly  earnings for any period should not be considered representative of earnings to be expected for any other period

critical accounting policies the company generally follows accounting policies standard in the brokerage industry and believes that its policies appropriately reflect its financial position and results of operations 
management has identified the use of estimates as its critical policy 
the estimates relate primarily to revenue and expense items in the normal course of business as to which the company receives no confirmations  invoices  or other documentation  at the time the books are closed for a period 
the company uses its best judgment  based on its knowledge of revenue transactions and expenses incurred  to estimate the amount of such revenue and expenses 
the company is not aware of any material differences between the estimates used in closing its books for the last five years and the actual amounts of revenue and expenses incurred when the company subsequently receives the actual confirmations  invoices or other documentation
