introduction since  medimmune has been focused on using biotechnology to produce innovative products to prevent or treat infectious disease  autoimmune disease and cancer 
in january  we acquired aviron a california based vaccines company the acquisition subsequently renamed medimmune vaccines  inc the operating results of medimmune vaccines  inc 
have been included in our consolidated operating results beginning january  medimmune currently actively markets four products  synagis  ethyol  cytogam and flumist and has a diverse pipeline of development stage products 
we are focused on developing important new products  particularly vaccines and antibodies that address significant medical needs in the areas of infectious diseases  immunology and oncology 
aviron s leading product candidate at the time of the acquisition was flumist  the first us vaccine delivered as a nasal mist 
on june   the biologics license application for the commercial sale of flumist was approved by the fda 
flumist is indicated for active immunization for the prevention of disease caused by influenza a and b viruses in healthy people  to years of age 
medimmune manufactures flumist and co promotes flumist with wyeth 
overview the company s financial condition strengthened from to  with cash and marketable securities increasing from billion to billion 
we improved our capital structure by issuing million of convertible senior notes the notes on favorable terms 
we used the proceeds from the notes to reinvest in our company through the repurchase of million in common shares which are held in treasury and capital expansion of our research and development  manufacturing and administrative facilities 
from an operating results perspective  our diluted earnings per share in were compared to a net loss per share in of 
excluding the impact of the acquisition  diluted earnings per share grew from in to in we also surpassed the one billion dollar mark for revenues  which totaled billion in while we were disappointed with the launch year results of the recently approved flumist product  the company continued to show strong top line and bottom line year over year growth  and improved financial condition as of december  as we look to the future  we intend to continue commercializing our core products and developing our pipeline  with the long term goal of strong revenue and earnings growth 
the disappointing launch of flumist in caused us to reassess our expectations of near term growth for flumist 
we have completed a reevaluation of the flumist program  and we intend to continue to develop the product 
we are refocusing on this development over the next two or three years  and we do not expect flumist to be profitable before we have not yet made final decisions regarding price  forecast or structure of the wyeth relationship for the influenza season and beyond 
other product development objectives include a target of three new inds in each of  and we anticipate that we will have four products in phase in further  we anticipate having at least two new product introductions over the next five years 
we also have the following expectations for product sales we believe that the growth rate of our product sales  while still at double digit levels  will decelerate in due to the significant contribution of synagis  we believe our revenues and operating results will reflect for the foreseeable future the seasonality of that product s use to prevent rsv disease  which occurs primarily during the winter months 
we do not expect flumist sales in the influenza season to exceed sales from the influenza season 
other revenues we anticipate the level of other revenues to decrease in largely due to decreases in milestone payments associated with the approval and commercialization of flumist 
the level of contract revenues in future periods will depend primarily upon the extent to which we enter into other collaborative contractual arrangements  if any  and the extent to which we achieve certain milestones provided for in existing agreements 
future revenues from the sale of excess production capacity will vary depending upon the extent to which we enter into these types of arrangements  and are not expected to be significant for or thereafter 
gross margin we expect that gross margins may vary significantly from quarter to quarter  based on the product mix 
we expect that our annual gross margin percentage for will be lower than  largely the result of the low volume of flumist revenues to cover the manufacturing costs of the product 
research and development expense we expect research and development expenses to increase significantly in compared to this is largely due to the initiation of four phase studies for vitaxin  post marketing commitments and additional trials associated with flumist  and the continued progress of numax and our other pipeline candidates 
in the event that medimmune were to allow wyeth to exit from the flumist relationship in  we would write off approximately million of unamortized intangible assets and would likely incur additional operating expenses 
over the next five years  we believe our financial position will strengthen  as we anticipate that our cash and marketable securities  net of debt repayments  repurchases of common stock  capital expansion funding and research and development expenditures  will grow 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments with respect to the selection and application of accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting estimates have the greatest impact on the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from product sales when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
during  we shipped million doses of flumist to wyeth and received payments totaling million 
wyeth is contractually responsible for distributing the product to third parties 
at the end of the influenza season  wyeth s actual net sales for the season are used to calculate the final transfer price per dose and the amount of product royalties due to medimmune 
actual net sales consists of any amounts actually received by wyeth for the sale of flumist less agreed upon amounts paid or credited by wyeth related to the sale of the product such as for returns  promotional discounts  rebates  taxes and freight 
prior to the calculation of actual net sales  our ability to recognize revenue is dependent upon our ability to estimate the sales volume for the season and the expected impact of the reduction to sales 
as of december   we concluded that the variables associated with the product transfer price were not determinable  largely due to low sales volume and the lack of returns history and comparable rebate redemption rates for rebates for this new product 
as a result  we have not recognized the revenue associated with the million doses shipped to wyeth during we believe the transfer price for the flu season will be determinable when actual net sales are calculated in  at which time we will record the associated product sales and cost of goods sold 
we receive royalties from licensees  which are based on third party sales of licensed products or technologies 
royalties are recorded as earned in accordance with the contract terms when third party results can be reliably measured and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we receive royalties from wyeth based on its sales of flumist under our worldwide collaborative agreements  as amended 
we have not recorded any royalty revenue from wyeth as of december  the same variables discussed above that affect actual net sales for wyeth also impact the product royalties that wyeth is required to remit to us 
when the variables are determinable in  we expect to record the product royalties as other revenue 
revenue from certain guaranteed payments where we continue involvement through a development collaboration or an obligation to supply product is recognized ratably over the development or supply period 
we may record deferred revenues related to milestone payments and other up front payments 
deferred revenue for manufacturing obligations is recognized as product is delivered 
deferred revenue associated with performance milestones is recognized based upon the achievement of the milestones  as defined in the respective agreements  as long as the milestones are substantive and at risk 
revenue under research and development cost reimbursement contracts is recognized as the related costs are incurred 
inventory we capitalize inventory costs associated with marketed products and certain products prior to regulatory approval and product launch  based on management s judgment of probable future commercial use and net realizable value 
we could be required to expense previously capitalized costs related to pre approval or pre launch inventory upon a change in such judgment  due to a denial or delay of approval by regulatory bodies  a delay in commercialization  or other potential factors 
conversely  our gross margins may be favorably impacted if some or all of the related production costs were expensed prior to the product being available for commercial sale 
we are required to state our inventory at lower of cost or market 
in assessing the ultimate realization of inventories  we are required to make judgments as to multiple factors affecting our inventories and compare these with current or committed inventory levels 
in the highly regulated industry in which we operate  raw materials  work in process and finished goods inventories have expiration dates that must be factored into our judgments about the recoverability of inventory costs 
additionally  if a product s pricing is such that we may not fully recover the cost of inventory  we must consider that in our judgments as well 
flumist inventories have required a significant amount of judgment since the acquisition in january one reason is that the finished flumist product has a shelf life of nine months 
most of the inventory components for flumist have expiration dates that range from nine to months 
the annual flumist production cycle begins in october of the year prior to the influenza season in which the product will be consumed 
for example  the production cycle for the season began in october all production costs for the season were fully reserved as we assessed the probability of approval by the fda in time to commercialize the product for the season was remote 
during  we disposed of million of fully reserved inventory related to the flu season 
beginning in october  production costs incurred for the season were partially reserved based on management s assessment of the probability of approval and net realizable value 
approval was received from the fda on june  at that time  approximately one half of the annual production costs for the season had already been fully reserved  million in q and million in q the production cycle for the season ended in mid october the production cycle for the season began in mid october for all inventory components on hand as of december   we reviewed the following assumptions to determine the amount of any necessary reserves the expected sales volume  the expected price to be received for the product  potential changes in the influenza strains recommended by the centers for disease control and prevention for each season s vaccine  and anticipated changes in the manufacturing process 
during the fourth quarter of  we determined that additional reserves of approximately million were required to reflect total flumist inventories at estimated realizable value 
these reserves are comprised of the following raw materials and work in process components million  finished goods inventory million  and finished goods inventory million 
the table below summarizes the activity within the components of flumist inventories gross inventory reserves net inventory flumist details as of december  q production  net q disposals q production  net q disposals q production  net q disposals q production  net q disposals q valuation adjustments december  for our other products  we periodically assess our inventory balances to determine whether net realizable value is below recorded cost 
factors we consider include expected sales volume  production capacity and expiration dates 
no significant inventory adjustments were recorded for the other products 
sales allowances and other sales related estimates reductions to gross product sales the company records allowances for discounts  returns  chargebacks and rebates due to government purchasers as reductions to gross product sales 
the timing of actual returns  chargebacks and discounts taken  and rebates paid to government purchasers can lag the sale of the product by several periods and varies by state 
as such  a significant amount of judgment is required when estimating the impact of sales allowances on gross sales for a reporting period 
our starting point for estimating each of these is our historical experience by product  updated for changes in facts and circumstances as appropriate 
because of the seasonal nature of our largest product  synagis  our sales discounts  returns  chargebacks and rebates fluctuate throughout the year 
if our historical trends are not indicative of the future  or our actual sales are materially different from projected amounts  or if our assessments prove to be materially different than actual occurrence  our results could be affected 
we estimate the amount of rebates due to government purchasers quarterly based on historical experience  along with updates  and based on our best estimate of the proportion of sales that will be subject to this reimbursement  largely comprised of medicaid payments to state governments 
during the first quarter of  we lowered our estimate of rebates due to government purchasers to reflect favorable historical experience and a change in our estimate of the proportion of the sales that are subject to reimbursement 
as we reviewed our estimates in the second and third quarters of  there were no new significant facts or circumstances that indicated a need for further adjustment 
during the fourth quarter of  we became aware of recent efforts by several states to collect rebates for product administered in certain settings for which reimbursement was not sought in the past 
after analyzing the situation  we determined that the new facts and circumstances warranted an increase in our estimate of rebates due to government purchasers 
as such  we recorded additional reserves for rebates due to government purchasers of approximately million during the fourth quarter of in addition  we increased our estimate of the proportion of current sales that will be subject to reimbursement  given the change in circumstance 
for the years ended december    and  allowances for discounts  returns  chargebacks and rebates due to government purchasers resulted in a net reduction to gross product sales of approximately each year 
reserves for discounts  returns  chargebacks and rebates that were accrued and not yet paid as of december  and were million and million  respectively 
reserves for discounts  returns  and chargebacks are netted against trade receivables and reserves for government reimbursements are included in accrued expenses in the accompanying balance sheets 
selling  general and administrative expenses we estimate our co promotion expense and sales commissions by applying an estimated rate that is based upon an estimate of projected sales for the season to our actual sales for the period 
we decreased co promotion expense by million in and increased co promotion expense by million in  resulting from the final reconciliation of net sales for the and contract years 
we estimate the level of bad debts as a percentage of gross trade accounts receivable balances outstanding at the end of the period  based upon our assessment of the concentration of credit risk  the financial condition and environment of our customers  and the level of credit insurance we obtain on our customers balances 
because of the seasonal nature of our largest product  synagis  our accounts receivable balances fluctuate significantly 
accordingly  our allowance for doubtful accounts also fluctuates 
our accounts receivable balances tend to be highest at the end of december and march  while the september balances are somewhat lower as our selling season is just beginning  and the june balances are negligible  reflecting the close out of the prior season 
for the year ended december   we recorded a million reduction in bad debt expense  largely based on our current assessment of the factors above 
for all periods presented  we have reclassified bad debt expense as selling  general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
income taxes we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is anticipated to be realized 
we consider future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
should we determine that we were able to realize more than the recorded amounts of net deferred tax assets in the future  our net income would increase in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of the net deferred tax asset in the future  our net income would decrease in the period such determination was made 
a tax reserve is recorded when the company cannot assert that it is probable that a tax position claimed on a return will be sustained upon challenge by the tax authority 
any change in the balance of a tax reserve during the year is treated as an adjustment to current year tax expense 
intangible assets we have recorded and valued significant intangible assets that we acquired as a result of the acquisition 
we engaged independent valuation experts who reviewed our critical assumptions and assisted us in determining a value for the identifiable intangibles 
of the million of acquired intangible assets  million was assigned to the worldwide collaborative agreement with wyeth for the development  manufacture  distribution  marketing  promotion  and sale of flumist 
the company estimated the fair value of the wyeth agreement using the sum of the probability adjusted scenarios under the income approach 
in applying this method  the company relied on revenue assumptions  profitability assumptions and anticipated approval dates 
the remaining million was assigned to a contract manufacturing agreement with evans vaccines limited 
the company estimated the fair value of the evans agreement using the cost approach  which is based on the theory that a prudent investor would pay no more for an asset than the amount for which the asset could be replaced 
in its analysis  the company reduced replacement cost for such factors as physical deterioration and functional or economic obsolescence 
we review intangible assets for impairment annually or when an event that could result in an impairment occurs 
as of december   we have not identified any impairment of the intangible assets  of which million remain unamortized 
during  we reduced goodwill recorded in the acquisition by million  reflecting additional deferred tax assets for adjustments relating to pre acquisition items 
results of operations to present our results in the same manner as we view the performance of the business and the resulting underlying trends  we have presented certain expense categories with and without certain acquisition related amounts  including the acquired in process research and development charge  amortization of intangible assets  compensation expense associated with the assumption and vesting of unvested stock options  retention and severance payments  and the amortization of the premium on convertible subordinated notes 
inclusion of such acquisition related expenses is consistent with generally acceptable accounting principles 
where we exclude such expenses  we use the term adjusted 
comparison of to revenues product sales growth in millions synagis ethyol flumist other products product sales grew in to million as compared to million in  primarily due to increased sales of synagis 
of the overall increase in product sales  approximately points of the percentage points were due to an increase in domestic sales volumes  while price increases  net of increases in sales allowances contributed five points to sales growth 
the remaining four points of growth are due to an increase in our international sales 
synagis synagis accounted for approximately and of our and product sales  respectively 
we achieved a increase in domestic synagis sales to million in  up from million in this growth was largely due to increased sales volume in the united states  which resulted in a increase in domestic units sold 
also aiding growth was a price increase that took effect in june  partially offset by an increase in sales allowances  which are accounted for as a reduction of product sales 
our reported international sales of synagis to ai  our exclusive distributor of synagis outside of the united states  more than doubled to million in compared to million in  driven primarily by a more than two fold increase in unit volumes over levels 
the increase in unit volume was offset by an decrease in the realized per unit sales price recognized upon delivery of product to ai under the terms of our international distribution agreement 
we record synagis international product sales based on ai s sales price to customers  as defined in the agreement 
ethyol ethyol accounted for approximately of our product sales in both and domestic ethyol sales increased to million in  up from million in this increase is the result of a increase in domestic units sold in compared to and a price increase which occurred in august our international sales of ethyol to our distribution partner  schering  were consistent with sales of million 
we record ethyol international product sales based on a percentage of schering s end user sales  as defined in our agreement 
flumist during  we shipped million doses of flumist to wyeth and received payments totaling million 
wyeth is contractually responsible for distributing the product to third parties 
at the end of the influenza season  actual net sales for the season will be used to calculate the final transfer price per dose and the amount of product royalties due to medimmune 
actual net sales consists of any amounts actually received by wyeth for the sale of flumist less agreed upon amounts paid or credited by wyeth related to the sale of the product such as for returns  promotional discounts  rebates  sales taxes and freight 
prior to the calculation of actual net sales  our ability to recognize revenue is dependent upon our ability to estimate the sales volume for the season and the expected impact of the reduction to sales 
as of december   we concluded that the variables associated with the product transfer price were not determinable  largely due to low sales volume and the lack of returns history and comparable redemption rates for rebates for this new product 
as a result  we have not recognized the revenue associated with the million doses shipped to wyeth during we believe the transfer price will be determinable when actual net sales are calculated in  at which time we will record the associated product sales and cost of goods sold 
other products sales of other products in  which include sales of cytogam  neutrexin  respigam  and by products that result from the cytogam manufacturing process  increased million  or compared to last year 
the increase was largely due to a increase in our sales of cytogam 
revenues other revenues other revenues for remained consistent with at million 
other revenues in are largely comprised of contractual payments received from wyeth under our collaborative agreement for flumist 
the payments  which amounted to million  related to milestone payments  supply goal payments  and funding for clinical development and marketing programs 
we also received million in from ai for achieving a milestone related to international sales levels of synagis and we recorded million in revenue under other collaborative agreements 
other revenues in are comprised largely of million in payments from wyeth for compensation of flumist manufacturing costs and funding for clinical development and marketing programs in  we also received million from the sale of excess production capacity to a third party and million in revenue recorded under other collaborative agreements 
we have accounted for major collaborative agreements entered into before january  using the contingency adjusted performance model and have deferred a portion of the up front and milestone payments received 
based on current estimates  we expect to record the remaining revenues from our collaboration with schering plough corporation of million ratably over and cost of sales historical acquisition related adjustments adjusted historical acquisition related adjustments adjusted in millions cost of sales for increased to million from million for excluding acquisition related adjustments in both periods  cost of sales for increased to million from million in  mainly due to increases in product sales volumes and inventory valuation adjustments for flumist of million 
gross margins on product sales for were  down three percentage points from last year  largely due to the valuation adjustments for flumist inventory 
partially offsetting this decrease were lower costs for cytogam  and a favorable impact of a value added tax refund for transfers of synagis manufactured in europe 
research and development expenses historical acquisition related adjustments adjusted historical acquisition related adjustments adjusted in millions research and development expenses of million in increased from million in excluding acquisition related adjustments in both periods  research and development expenses for were million  up over the increase is due largely to payments made in associated with gaining access to new data and technologies including a million payment to critical therapeutics  inc as part of a new collaboration to co develop biologic products to treat severe inflammatory diseases 
additionally in  the company initiated four phase studies for vitaxin and agreed to pay million for data from the completed international phase studies for a liquid formulation of the live  attenuated influenza virus vaccine 
this data may have the potential to accelerate the evolution of medimmune s long range plans for its intranasally delivered flu vaccine program in the united states 
in  the company completed several late stage clinical trials  including phase clinical trials with siplizumab  and the phase synagis clinical trial in congenital heart disease patients that led to approval of an expanded indication by the fda in september during  we incurred significant costs related to the development of various products and product candidates 
a summary of our more significant research and development efforts is as follows product candidates description stage of development vitaxin melanoma  prostate cancer  rheumatoid arthritis  psoriasis phase caiv t liquid flumist a liquid  refrigerator stable version of flumist phase flumist frozen intranasally delivered virus vaccine to prevent influenza infection phase and label expansion ethyol subcutaneous administration in nsclc patients reduction of esophogitis and pneumocytis phase numax third generation anti rsv antibody phase additionally  we have multiple programs in preclinical development 
selling  general  and administrative expenses historical acquisition related adjustments adjusted historical acquisition related adjustments adjusted in millions selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased to million in compared to million for the period 
excluding acquisition related amounts relating to retention payments  stock option acceleration and stock compensation for unvested stock options assumed and amortization of intangibles  sg a expenses were million  up over the increase is largely attributable to increased co promotion expense  reflective of the increase in synagis sales 
as a percentage of product sales  adjusted sg a expense decreased to of product sales in the period from in the period  due to product sales growing at a faster rate than expenses 
other operating expenses historical acquisition related adjustments adjusted historical acquisition related adjustments adjusted in millions other operating expenses  which reflect manufacturing start up costs and other manufacturing related costs  were million in compared to million in adjusted other operating expenses were million for  compared to million in the decrease is principally due to the shift in the costs of flumist manufacturing that are capitalized in inventory beginning in the second quarter of  but were expensed as other operating costs in the prior year 
additionally  other operating expenses include impairment charges of million relating to the write off of certain plasma manufacturing assets  as the company outsourced its production of cytogam during in process research and development we incurred charges of  million in the first quarter of for the write off of purchased in process research and development in conjunction with the acquisition 
the write off represented the fair value of purchased in process technologies at the acquisition date  calculated as the sum of probability adjusted commercial scenarios 
this method was based upon management s estimates of the probability of fda approval and commercial success for flumist 
interest income and expense we earned interest income of million for  compared to million in  reflecting higher cash balances available for investment  partially offset by a decrease in interest rates  which lowered the overall portfolio yield 
interest expense for  net of amounts capitalized  was million  up from million for excluding the acquisition related amounts of million in and million in for the amortization of premium on the convertible subordinated notes the notes  adjusted interest expense increased to million in from million in  due to interest expense generated by the notes issued in july gain loss on investment activities we incurred a gain on investment activities of million for  compared to a loss of million for the gain consisted of gains on the sale of our publicly traded equity investments  net of declines in fair value of other investments that were judged to be other than temporary 
investment losses in consisted primarily of impairment charges on investments related to declines in fair value that were judged to be other than temporary 
income taxes we recorded income tax expense of million for the year ended december   based on an effective tax rate of 
excluding items not deductible for tax purposes  principally the write off of purchased in process research and development  the resulting effective tax rate for was 
net earnings loss historical acquisition related adjustments adjusted historical acquisition related adjustments adjusted in millions net earnings for were million  or per share basic and per share diluted  compared to a net loss for of billion or per share 
excluding the after tax impact of the acquisition related amounts totaling million in and billion in  adjusted net earnings were million in  or basic and diluted earnings per share and million  or basic and diluted per share in shares used in computing basic and diluted earnings per share in on a historical basis were and  respectively 
shares used in computing net loss per share on a historical basis for were million 
on an adjusted basis  shares used in computing basic and diluted earnings per share in were and  respectively  while shares used in computing basic and diluted earnings loss per share for were million and million  respectively 
we do not believe inflation had a material effect on our financial statements 
compared to revenues product sales growth in millions synagis ethyol other products product sales grew to million  compared to million in  primarily due to increased sales of synagis and the impact of reacquiring the domestic marketing rights to ethyol from alza as of october  synagis synagis accounted for approximately and  respectively  of our and product sales 
we achieved a increase in domestic synagis sales to million in  up from million in this growth was largely due to increased demand in the united states  and resulted in a increase in domestic units sold 
also aiding growth was a price increase that took effect in june  partially offset by an increase in sales allowances  which were accounted for as a reduction to product sales 
our reported international sales of synagis decreased to million in compared to million in  due to a decrease in units sold to ai  our exclusive distributor of synagis outside of the united states 
we believe that the decrease was due to reductions in the inventory stocking levels of ai  rather than reduced product demand by end users 
the decrease in unit volume was offset by an increase in the per unit sales price recognized upon delivery of product to ai under the terms of our international distribution agreement 
based on information received from ai  we believe that end user sales have increased over the year 
we recorded synagis international product sales based on ai s sales price to customers  as defined in the agreement 
ethyol ethyol accounted for approximately and of our product sales in and  respectively 
on october  we reacquired domestic marketing rights to ethyol from alza and have since recorded all revenues from domestic sales of ethyol to wholesalers and distributors 
as part of this agreement  no third quarter supply sales were made to alza  and we purchased alza s remaining ethyol inventory at their original purchase price  which was recorded as a reduction to product sales 
beginning april   we pay alza a declining royalty through based on net sales of ethyol in the united states 
domestic ethyol sales were million in  as compared to million in the increase was primarily attributable to a three fold increase in domestic units sold in versus the year  which included nine months of revenues generated under our product supply agreement with alza and three months of sales to wholesalers and distributors 
further  two domestic price increases occurred during  including a increase in april and a increase in september in addition  included net returns of million  relating to our assumption of ethyol marketing rights 
prior to october   we recorded ethyol domestic product sales based on alza s net unit selling price as defined in the agreement 
our international sales of ethyol to our distribution partner  schering  were million for  down from the prior year sales of million 
other products sales of other products in  which included sales of cytogam  neutrexin  respigam  and by products that resulted from the cytogam manufacturing process  decreased million  or compared to the decrease was due to marginal declines in all of our other product lines 
revenues other revenues other revenues increased to million for compared to million in the increase was largely attributable to million received from wyeth  our marketing partner for flumist  for compensation of flumist manufacturing costs under amendments to the collaborative agreements 
an increase of million in revenues from the sale of excess production capacity to a third party and million in funding for flumist clinical development and sales and marketing activities from wyeth also contributed to the growth over partially offsetting these increases was a decrease of million in revenue recorded under collaborative agreements  including a million decrease in clinical funding received for our hpv vaccine candidate as we were nearing completion of phase and clinical trials and our preparation of clinical material 
cost of sales cost of sales for increased to million from million in  due to the increase in sales volumes and additional royalties owed for synagis  partially offset by manufacturing cost reductions following implementation of an improved manufacturing process at the fmc which enhanced the yields for synagis 
as a result  gross margins for were down two percentage points to from for the year ended december  research and development expenses research and development expenses of million in increased from million in excluding acquisition related amounts of million in for retention payments  stock option acceleration and stock compensation expense for unvested options assumed  adjusted research and development expenses were million  up over this increase was largely due to the on going activities of medimmune vaccines and payments of approximately million to gain access to various technologies and intellectual property to advance our pipeline 
the increases were offset by decreases in clinical trial expenses  as several of our clinical trials were either completed  cancelled or delayed during during  we completed several important clinical trials  including a successful phase trial for synagis in children with congenital heart disease and three phase trials for siplizumab 
during  we completed the preliminary analysis of three phase trials for siplizumab involving almost psoriasis patients 
while the drug appeared to be generally well tolerated and some patients exhibited an improvement in their psoriatic disease  an anti antibody response also known as immunogenicity was observed in the laboratory tests of over percent of the patients 
this anti antibody response did not appear to cause any clinical complications 
we also completed two phase trials of our e 
coli urinary tract infection vaccine  and have determined that there was not a sufficient level of efficacy in prevention of urinary tract infections to proceed with additional trials 
our ongoing clinical program also included several product candidates in various phases of evaluation  including a phase trial in adults using a liquid formulation of synagis and certain trials for flumist 
additionally  we had multiple programs in preclinical development 
selling  general  and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased to million in compared to million for the period 
excluding acquisition related amounts of million in expense in relating to retention payments  stock option acceleration and stock compensation for unvested stock options assumed and amortization of intangibles  adjusted sg a expenses were million  up over as a percentage of product sales  adjusted sg a expense increased to of product sales in the period from in the period 
the increase in this ratio was largely reflective of the impact of the acquisition and the inclusion of medimmune vaccines ongoing expenses 
additionally  we incurred increased co promotion expense directly related to the growth in domestic sales of synagis  higher salaries and sales commissions  as well as increased synagis marketing expense 
sg a expenses for also included a million charge associated with the settlement of a contractual dispute in august regarding an agreement with the massachusetts biologic laboratories of the university of massachusetts mbl to transfer certain technology relating to the company s monoclonal antibody manufacturing operations 
the comparison to was favorably impacted as million of expenses related to our accelerated acquisition of ethyol marketing rights from alza was included in sg a for other operating expenses other operating expenses  which reflected manufacturing start up costs and other manufacturing related costs  increased to million in from million in excluding acquisition related amounts of million in expense in relating to stock compensation for unvested stock options assumed and amortization of intangibles  adjusted other operating expenses were million 
the increase over was primarily related to million of pre production costs and inventory reserves for flumist 
the majority of the cost incurred for flumist was associated with preparing for the aborted commercial launch 
additionally  we incurred a million charge for the write off of cytogam manufacturing equipment as the company had outsourced cytogam production activities as of november also included in other operating expense for both periods was excess capacity costs associated with the plasma production section of the fmc 
in process research and development we incurred charges of  million for the year ended december  for the write off of purchased in process research and development in conjunction with the acquisition 
the write off represented the fair value of purchased in process technologies at the acquisition date  calculated utilizing the sum of the probability adjusted scenarios under the income approach using a discount rate of  and certain in process research and development projects  primarily flumist 
we do not believe that there would be any alternative future use for the in process technologies that were written off 
flumist is a live  attenuated vaccine delivered via a nasal mist for the prevention of influenza 
it is a frozen vaccine requiring freezer storage 
a liquid influenza vaccine is currently being developed by our partner wyeth 
while there are other flu vaccines currently marketed by other companies  flumist is  to our knowledge  the only live virus vaccine administered as a nasal mist 
the valuation of the acquired in process research and development was based upon certain estimates and assumptions by management 
the valuation was based upon management s estimates of the probability of fda approval and commercial success for flumist 
management s projections were based on assumptions  which may or may not remain valid for the relevant period  including the estimated impact of four key factors price per dose  dose volume  launch date  and the potential failure of the frozen or liquid formulations of the influenza vaccine 
interest income and expense we earned interest income of million for  compared to million in  reflecting higher cash balances available for investment  largely due to the acquisition  partially offset by a decrease in interest rates  which lowered the overall portfolio yield

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our risk management activities includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
our primary market risks as of december  are the exposures to loss resulting from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and equity prices 
market risk exposure with respect to interest rates and equity prices exceeds that of december  due to the increase in the size of our investment portfolio 
as of december   our excess cash balances are primarily invested in marketable debt securities with investment grade credit ratings 
substantially all of our cash and cash equivalents and short term and long term investments are held in custody by three major us financial institutions 
deposits held with banks may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits 
generally  these deposits may be redeemed upon demand and  therefore  bear minimal risk 
our investments include us corporate debt securities  which include commercial paper and notes  international bank debt securities  and us government and agency notes and bonds 
the maturities range from one month to seven years 
our investment guidelines are intended to limit the amount of investment exposure as to issuer  maturity  and investment type

the cost basis of medimmune venture s investment holdings was million as of december   and is expected to increase in the future as it continues to invest in accordance with its investment strategy 
medimmune venture s minority interest investments are subject to adjustment for other than temporary impairments 
we recognize impairment charges in the consolidated statements of operations when a decline in the fair value of an investment falls below its cost value and is judged to be other than temporary 
we consider various factors in determining whether we should recognize an impairment charge  including the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than our cost basis  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  fundamental changes to the business prospects of the investee  share prices of subsequent offerings  and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
during and  the company recorded impairment losses of million and million  respectively  based on the duration and magnitude of the declines in fair value  as well as the financial condition and near term prospects of the investee companies 
we did not incur any impairment losses during the year ended december  we expect the volatility in the fair value of our minority investments to continue and  thus  the value assigned to the investments could change significantly from period to period 
as of december   the medimmune venture s portfolio included approximately million shares of common stock in two publicly traded companies with which the company previously formed strategic alliances 
in accordance with our investment strategy  we intend to liquidate our holdings in these equity securities over a period of approximately one year  now that our business objectives have been reached 
to hedge the risk of market fluctuations relative to these investments  we entered into equity derivative contracts during the second half of  which have been designated as cash flow hedges 
as of december   the unrealized gain on the marketable equity securities related to this hedge was million  while the fair value of the derivative contracts was a liability of million  resulting in a net unrealized gain on the hedging transaction 
during the fourth quarter of  we recognized net gains on sales of a portion of the holdings of million 
the remainder of medimmune venture s portfolio as of december  consists of minority interest investments in privately held biotechnology companies 
the investments are maintained on the cost or equity method of accounting  according to the facts and circumstances of the individual investment 
for investments carried on the equity method  the company s proportionate share of the investee s gains or losses is recorded on a quarterly basis 
as of december   the investments had a cost basis of million 
following the acquisition  the company s subsidiary  medimmune vaccines  assumed the obligation for million in notes due these notes were recorded at their fair value of million  based on quoted market prices as of january   the acquisition date 
interest is payable semi annually in arrears in cash on february and august each year 
changes in interest rates do not affect interest expense incurred because they bear interest at fixed rates 
during  the company purchased million principal amount of the notes in the open market for million  resulting in a net gain of million on early extinguishment recorded to earnings 
as of december   the notes are convertible into an aggregate of million shares of the company s common stock  based on a conversion price of  at any time on or before february  the company may redeem the notes beginning in february  at redemption prices declining from of their principal amount in to in  plus accrued interest 
the estimated fair value of these notes at december   based on quoted market prices  was million 
during july  we issued million of convertible notes due these notes bear interest at per annum payable semi annually in arrears 
beginning with the six month interest period commencing july   if the average trading price of these notes during specified periods equals or exceeds of the principal amount of such notes  we will pay contingent interest equal to per six month period of the average trading price per  of the principal amount during such periods 
as a result  if the market value of these notes appreciates significantly in the future  we could be obligated to pay significant amounts of contingent interest beginning in the estimated fair value of the notes at december   based on quoted market prices  was million 
changes in interest rates do not affect interest expense incurred on our remaining outstanding indebtedness of million and million at december  and  respectively  because the borrowings are in the form of notes that bear interest primarily at fixed rates 
the estimated fair value of the remaining long term debt at december  and  based on quoted market prices or discounted cash flows at currently available borrowing rates  was million and million  respectively 
maturities for all long term debt for the next five years are as follows  million   million   million   million  and  million 
expenditures relating to our manufacturing operations in the united kingdom and the netherlands are paid in local currency 
we have not hedged our expenditures relating to these manufacturing operations  therefore  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may result in increases or decreases in the amount of expenditures recorded 
additionally  certain of our distribution agreements outside the united states provide for us to be paid based upon sales in local currency 
as a result  changes in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect the amount we expect to collect under these agreements 
the company has entered into a supplemental manufacturing contract denominated in euros 
fluctuations in the euro us dollar exchange rate may lead to changes in the us dollar cost of manufacturing 
to reduce the risk of unpredictable changes in these costs  the company may  from time to time  enter into forward foreign exchange contracts 
currently  we have firm commitments with bi for planned production and fill finish for approximately million euros 
as of december   the company did not have any open foreign exchange forward contracts 
as of december   the company had outstanding forward contracts to purchase million euros  all expiring within one year 
fair value of the outstanding contracts at december  was million 
during  we entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to purchase million british pounds gbps to fund payments due under construction contracts denominated in gbps 
the contracts were originally designated as cash flow hedges  but were later determined to be ineffective and subsequently cancelled  resulting in a net gain of million recorded to the income statement
