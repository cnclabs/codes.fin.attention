overview we are a provider of private  for profit  postsecondary education with campuses throughout the united states  canada  france  the united kingdom  and the united arab emirates

our total student population as of january   was approximately  students  including total student population of our colleges  schools and universities segment and online education group segment of approximately  and  respectively 
our schools enjoy long operating histories and offer a variety of doctoral degree  master s degree  bachelor s degree  associate degree  and diploma programs in career oriented disciplines within our core curricula of visual communication and design technologies information technology business studies culinary arts health education we have experienced significant growth both organically and through acquisitions 
we have invested significant amounts of capital in the hiring of additional personnel and increased marketing and capital improvements at each of the schools we have acquired or opened 
these increased human resources and marketing costs are expensed as incurred and reflected in general and administrative expenses 
our annual revenue has increased from million in to billion in  and our annual net income has increased from million in to million in in addition  we believe that earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization ebitda  while not a substitute for generally accepted accounting principles measures of operating results  is an important measure of our financial performance and that of our schools 
for the year ended december   ebitda was million  a increase from ebitda of million for the year ended december  we believe that ebitda is particularly meaningful due principally to the role acquisitions have played in our development 
historically  our rapid growth through acquisitions has resulted in significant non cash depreciation and amortization expense because a significant portion of the purchase price of an acquired school is generally allocated to depreciable fixed assets and amortizable intangible assets 
a reconciliation of net income to ebitda is provided in item revenue our principal source of revenue is tuition collected from our students 
the academic year is at least weeks in length but varies both by individual school and program of study and is divided by term  which is determined by start dates  which also vary by school and program 
payment of each term s tuition may be made by financial aid  full cash payment  an installment payment plan  or a combination thereof 
our schools charge tuition at varying amounts  depending not only on the particular school but also upon the type of program and the specific curriculum

tuition revenue and one time fees  such as application fees  are recognized on a straight line basis over the length of the applicable period of instruction 
the portion of tuition payments received but not earned is recorded as deferred revenue 
if a student withdraws from school prior to the completion of the term  we refund the portion of tuition already paid that  pursuant to our refund policy and applicable federal and state law and accrediting agency standards  we are not entitled to retain 
once a student completes a certain minimum portion of the term  as defined pursuant to our refund policy and applicable federal and state law and accrediting agency standards  he or she is not entitled to a refund of tuition paid 
other revenue consists primarily of bookstore sales  dormitory revenue  student laptop computer sales  placement revenue  contract training revenue  rental income  cafeteria revenue  and restaurant revenue 
revenue from dormitory and cafeteria fees charged to students are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of a student s dormitory and cafeteria use 
other dormitory and cafeteria revenue is recognized upon delivery of goods or services

critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting policies generally accepted in the united states 
the application of generally accepted accounting principles may require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
management bases its estimates on historical experience  assessment of current conditions  and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities and are not readily apparent from other sources 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments by management and uncertainties  and that could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
although  historically  actual results have not deviated significantly from those determined using management s estimates  as discussed below  our consolidated financial position or results of operations could be materially different if we were to report under different conditions or using different assumptions in the application of our critical accounting policies 
the critical accounting policies discussed herein are not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  with no need for management s judgment in the application of such principles 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result from the result derived from the application of our critical accounting policies 
we believe that the following accounting policies are most critical to us in that they represent the primary areas where financial information is subject to the application of management s estimates  assumptions  and judgment in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue is derived primarily from programs taught at our schools or online 
tuition revenue and one time fees  such as application fees  are recognized on a straight line basis over the length of the applicable period of instruction 
revenue from dormitory and cafeteria fees charged to students are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of a student s dormitory and cafeteria use 
other dormitory and cafeteria revenues are recognized upon delivery 
other revenue  such as student laptop computer sales  bookstore sales  placement revenue  restaurant revenue  rental income  and contract training revenue  is recognized as services are performed or goods are delivered 
the portion of payments received but not earned is recorded as deferred revenue and reflected as a current liability in our consolidated balance sheet  as such amount represents revenue that we expect to earn within the next year 
refunds are calculated and paid in accordance with applicable federal  state  and accrediting agency standards and school policy 
allowance for doubtful accounts based upon past experience and judgment  we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts with respect to tuition receivables 
in establishing our allowance for doubtful accounts  we consider  among other things  a student s status in school or out of school  whether or not additional financial aid funding will be collected from title iv programs or other sources  whether or not a student is currently making payments  and overall collections history 
changes in trends in any of these areas may impact the allowance for doubtful accounts 
the receivable balances of withdrawn students with delinquent obligations are fully reserved in our allowance for doubtful accounts 
our historical bad debt expense as a percentage of revenue for the years ended december    and was   and  respectively 
because a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from title iv programs  any legislative or regulatory action that significantly reduces the funding available under title iv programs or the ability of our students or schools to participate in title iv programs could have a material effect on the realizability of our receivables 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill related to each acquisition completed prior to june   has been amortized through december   on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life 
goodwill related to acquisitions completed after june   has not been amortized  as required under sfas effective january   pursuant to our adoption of sfas  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer subject to amortization 
however  these assets are reviewed for impairment on at least an annual basis by applying a fair value based test 
during the second quarter of  we completed the transitional intangible asset impairment test required under sfas and  based on the results of the test  concluded that no impairment of goodwill or other indefinite lived intangible assets had occurred 
therefore  no impairment loss was recorded in connection with our adoption of sfas in evaluating the recoverability of the carrying value of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of our reporting units  as defined under sfas if our fair value estimates or related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges related to goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets 
definite lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives 
recoverability of long lived assets on an ongoing basis  we review property and equipment  definite lived intangible assets  and other long lived assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
to date  no such events or changes in circumstances have occurred 
if such events or changes in circumstances occur  we will recognize an impairment loss if the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or acquired business are less than the carrying value of the related asset 
the impairment loss would adjust the asset to its fair value 
in evaluating the recoverability of long lived assets  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of such assets 
if our fair value estimates or related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges related to long lived assets and definite lived intangible assets 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
this requires the recognition of deferred income taxes based upon the tax consequences of temporary differences between financial reporting and income tax reporting by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities 
sfas also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income tax liability for each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current income tax expense and assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of certain income or expense items for income tax reporting and financial reporting purposes 
we also recognize as deferred tax assets the expected future tax benefits of net operating loss carry forwards 
in evaluating the realizability of deferred tax assets associated with net operating loss carry forwards  we consider  among other things  expected future taxable income  the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary reporting differences  and the expected impact of tax planning strategies that may be implemented to prevent the potential loss of future tax benefits 
changes in  among other things  income tax legislation  statutory income tax rates  or future taxable income levels could materially impact our valuation of income tax assets and liabilities and could cause our income tax provision to vary significantly among financial reporting periods

the student is responsible for paying the interest on an unsubsidized stafford loan while in school and after leaving school 
students who are eligible for a subsidized stafford loan may also receive an unsubsidized stafford loan 
a student is not required to meet any specific credit criteria to receive a stafford loan  but any student with a prior stafford loan default  or who has been convicted under federal or state law of selling or possessing drugs  will not be eligible for a stafford loan 
the doe has established maximum annual limits on the amount of stafford loans that students may borrow  and these annual limits are generally less than the tuition costs at our us institutions 
a plus loan is a loan made directly by financial institutions to the parents of our students that participate in the ffel program 
parents who have an acceptable credit history can borrow under a plus loan to pay the educational expenses of a child who is a dependent student enrolled at least half time at our us institutions 
the amount of a plus loan cannot exceed the student s cost of attendance less all other financial aid received 
as the stafford loan limits are generally significantly less than the tuition costs at our us accredited institutions  our students have been obtaining private loans to finance the remainder of their tuition costs 
these private loans are made directly to our students by financial institutions and are not guaranteed under the ffel program 
two types of private loans are available to our students non recourse loans and recourse loans 
a financial institution providing a non recourse loan assumes of the credit risk on the loan 
to receive a non recourse loan the student  or the student and a co borrower  must meet the credit criteria established by the financial institution for these loans 
each financial institution has established its respective credit criteria and loan limits 
students and co borrowers can generally borrow an amount equal to the student s cost of attendance less all other financial aid received 
the majority of non recourse private loans received by our students at our us institutions during were provided by two financial institutions sallie mae and wachovia bank 
we have also entered into recourse loan agreements with sallie mae and wachovia bank 
under these recourse loan agreements  we have agreed to guarantee a fixed percentage  ranging from to  of the private loans made by these financial institutions to students whose credit score was below the credit score required under non recourse criteria established by the financial institution or who had little or no credit 
under these recourse loan agreements  the financial institution retains a fixed percentage of the loan amounts disbursed and deposits this amount into a reserve account 
when a student defaults on a recourse loan  as defined in the recourse loan agreement  we will purchase this defaulted loan from the financial institution from the amount on deposit in the reserve account 
once the amount on deposit in the reserve account has been reduced to zero  we have no further liability with respect to the recourse loans 
we consider the amounts guaranteed to be an educational services and facilities expense  and we generally recognize this expense on a straight line basis over the length of the applicable student s program 
under our recourse loan agreement with sallie mae  which require us to guarantee of loans funded under the agreement  we have a million recourse loan funding limit  of which approximately million had been disbursed to our students as of december  this recourse loan agreement expires in june the recourse loan agreement with wachovia bank expired in june and was not renewed 
increases in tuition received from non recourse loans have mitigated  to a certain degree  our exposure to credit and collection risk 
however  because such loans are available only to lower credit risk students  the increase in non recourse loan fund flow has not eliminated our exposure to receivables due from higher credit risk students 
the doe requires that we keep unbilled title iv program funds that are collected in separate cash accounts until the students are billed for the program portion related to those title iv program funds 
in addition  all funds transferred to our schools through electronic funds transfer programs are held in a separate cash account until certain conditions are satisfied 
as of december   the balance of such funds held in separate cash accounts is not significant 
the restrictions on any cash held in these accounts have not significantly affected our ability to fund daily operations 
operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities increased to million in from million in the increase is attributable primarily to an increase in net income of approximately million and a million decrease in net operating assets during relative to a million decrease in net operating assets during excluding the impact of the million august   royalty payment to le cordon bleu limited  as discussed below  cash flow from operating activities during was approximately million 
excluding the impact of cash paid to former whitman option holders during july of approximately million  as discussed below  cash flows from operating activities during was approximately million 
net receivables increased million or  from million as of december  to million as of december  net receivables as of december  and  were and  respectively  of total revenue for the years ended december  and quarterly days sales outstanding dso were days as of december  this represents a four day decrease from dso as of december   of days 
the decrease in dso from december  to december  is attributable primarily to the implementation during of more aggressive cash collections practices and stricter credit standards 
we calculate dso by dividing net receivables by quarterly average daily revenue 
quarterly average daily revenue is computed by dividing total quarterly revenue by the total number of days in the quarter 
deferred tuition revenue increased million or  from million as of december  to million as of december  the increase is attributable primarily to an increase in student population  which includes the impact of our acquisitions  and the implementation during of more aggressive cash collection practices 
on august   we amended our license agreement with le cordon bleu limited to reduce the royalty rate payable on eligible culinary revenues from to from september   through december  as consideration for the royalty rate reduction  we paid le cordon bleu limited a one time royalty fee of million with cash generated from operating activities and funds obtained under our prior credit agreement 
in connection with the amendment  we also issued le cordon bleu limited an option to purchase  shares of our common stock 
investing activities 
capital expenditures increased from million during to million during capital expenditures during  which represented approximately of total revenue  included  among other things  investments in leasehold improvements in connection with new and expanded facilities  and capital equipment purchases necessitated by increasing student population 
approximately of our total capital expenditures were made in connection with expansion projects and information system improvements in support of current and anticipated future growth 
we expect capital expenditures to be approximately of total revenue during as additional schools are acquired or opened  student population increases  and current facilities and equipment are upgraded and expanded 
we finance capital expenditures primarily with cash generated from operations 
on september   we acquired of the issued and outstanding stock of missouri college  inc the purchase price of approximately million  excluding estimated acquisition costs of approximately million  was paid in cash with funds obtained under our prior credit agreement 
on february   we acquired of the issued and outstanding stock of formastrat sa and its subsidiaries  also known as the inseec group  for approximately million  including assumed debt of million and excluding estimated acquisition costs of approximately million  primarily with funds obtained under our us credit agreement 
on july   we acquired of the issued and outstanding stock of whitman education group  inc for approximately million  excluding estimated acquisition costs of approximately million 
the cash portion of the purchase price of approximately million and cash consideration paid to whitman option holders of approximately million was paid primarily with funds obtained under our us credit agreement 
whitman shareholders also received an aggregate of approximately million shares of our common stock in connection with the transaction 
on august   we acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of western school of health and business careers for approximately million  excluding estimated acquisition costs of million  primarily with funds obtained under our us credit agreement 
financing activities and capital resources 
from may  through december   we maintained a credit agreement with a consortium of banks that was amended from time to time 
the amended credit agreement allowed us to borrow up to million under a revolving credit facility and obtain up to million in standby letters of credit

during the first quarter of  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to effectively fix at the rate of interest payable by us on a certain portion of million  denominated in million  borrowed under our us credit agreement to finance our acquisition of the inseec group 
the notional amount of the interest rate swap  which expires in march   is million and decreases by million every six months beginning june  the impact of the interest rate swap agreement on our consolidated financial position  or results of operations  or cash flows during the year ended december   was not significant

recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no

sfas is effective for financial statements for annual periods ending after december   and interim periods beginning after december  we have adopted the amendments to sfas disclosure provisions required under sfas but will continue to use the intrinsic value method under opinion to account for stock based compensation 
as such  our adoption of this statement has not had a significant impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no

our adoption of this statement has not had a significant impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
risks related to our business the following risks  uncertainties  and other factors could have a material adverse affect on our business  financial condition  operating results  and growth prospects 
failure to comply with extensive regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business failure of our us schools to comply with extensive regulations could result in financial penalties  restrictions on our operations  or loss of external financial aid funding for our students 
we derive a significant portion of our revenue from students participating in us federal student financial aid programs administered by the doe 
for these programs to be available to its students  a us institution must obtain and maintain authorization by the appropriate state agencies  accreditation by an accrediting agency recognized by the doe  and certification by the doe 
as a result  our us schools are subject to extensive regulation by these agencies 
these regulations cover virtually all phases of our operations  including our educational programs  facilities  instructional and administrative staff  administrative procedures  marketing and recruiting  financial operations  payment of refunds to students who withdraw  and financial strength 
these regulations also affect our ability to acquire or open additional schools  add new educational programs  or change our corporate structure 
the agencies that regulate our operations periodically revise their requirements and modify their interpretations of existing requirements 
if one of our schools were to violate any of these regulatory requirements  we could suffer a financial penalty 
a regulatory agency could also place limitations on our schools operations or terminate the schools ability to grant degrees and certificates or their eligibility to receive federal student financial aid funds on behalf of its students 
a significant portion of our students rely on federal student financial aid funds to finance their education 
we cannot predict with certainty how all of these requirements will be applied  or whether each of our schools will be able to comply with all of the requirements in the future 
we have described some of the most significant regulatory requirements and risks that apply to our us schools in the following paragraphs 
please also see business financial aid and regulation for more detailed information on the regulations and other requirements that apply to us 
the us congress may change the law or reduce funding for federal student financial aid programs  which could harm our student population and revenue 
the us congress periodically revises the higher education act and other laws governing the federal student financial aid programs and annually determines the funding level for each of these programs 
during  congress is expected to devote significant attention to reauthorizing the higher education act  which will likely result in numerous legislative changes 
any action by congress that significantly reduces funding for the federal student financial aid programs or the ability of our schools or students to participate in these programs could have a material adverse effect on our student population and revenue 
legislative action may also increase our administrative costs and require us to modify our practices in order for our schools to comply fully with applicable requirements 
if we or our schools do not meet financial responsibility standards  our schools may be required to post a letter of credit and our participation in federal student financial aid programs could be limited  which could harm our net income and student population 
to participate in the federal student financial aid programs  an institution must meet general standards of financial responsibility and either meet specific numeric measures of financial responsibility prescribed by the doe or post a letter of credit in favor of the doe and possibly accept other conditions on its participation in the federal student financial aid programs 
currently  none of our schools is required to post a letter of credit in favor of the doe or accept other conditions on its participation in the federal student financial aid programs due to failure to satisfy the numeric measures of financial responsibility 
if  however  we or our institutions fail to satisfy the numeric standards in the future  any required letter of credit  if obtainable  and any limitations on our participation in the federal student financial aid programs could adversely affect our net income and student population 
our inability to obtain a required letter of credit could also adversely affect our net income and student population 
under a separate requirement  an institution must post a letter of credit if it makes more than a certain proportion of student refunds beyond the regulatory time period 
nineteen of our institutions have outstanding letters of credit in favor of the doe in the amount of million due to late student refunds 
our schools may lose eligibility to participate in federal student financial aid programs if their student loan default rates are too high  which could harm our student population and revenue 
an institution may lose its eligibility to participate in some or all of the federal student financial aid programs if defaults by its students on their federal student loans exceed specified rates 
if any of our institutions  depending on its size  loses eligibility to participate in the federal student financial aid programs because of high student loan default rates  that loss could have a material adverse effect on our student population and revenue 
our schools may lose eligibility to participate in federal student financial aid programs if the percentage of their revenue derived from those programs is too high  which could harm our student population and revenue 
a proprietary institution loses its eligibility to participate in the federal student financial aid programs if it derives more than of its revenue from these programs in any fiscal year 
if any of our institutions  depending on its size  loses eligibility to participate in federal student financial aid programs  that loss could have a material adverse effect on our student population and revenue 
if regulators do not approve our acquisition of schools from third parties  the acquired schools would not be permitted to participate in federal student financial aid programs 
when we acquire an institution  the doe and most applicable state authorizing agencies and accrediting agencies consider that a change of ownership or control of the institution has occurred 
a change of ownership or control of an institution under the standards of the doe may result in the temporary suspension of the institution s participation in the federal student financial aid programs until the doe issues a temporary certification document 
if we were unable to promptly reestablish the state authorization  accreditation or doe certification of an institution we acquired  depending on the size of that acquisition  that failure could have a material adverse effect on our business 
if regulators do not approve transactions involving a change of control or change in our corporate structure  we may lose our ability to participate in federal student financial aid programs 
if we experience a change of control under the standards of applicable state agencies  accrediting agencies or the doe  we or the schools governed by such agencies must seek the approval of the relevant agencies 
the failure of any of our schools to reestablish its state authorization  accreditation or doe certification would result in a suspension or loss of federal student financial aid funding  which could have a material adverse effect on our student population and revenue 
the doe  state agencies  or accrediting agencies may consider other transactions or events to constitute a change of control 
if the doe or any other regulatory agencies interpreted a particular sequence of events to constitute a change of control  we would be required to seek all necessary approvals to continue our participation in the federal student financial aid programs  and could at least temporarily lose access to financial aid funding on that basis 
some of these transactions or events  such as a significant acquisition of our common stock  may be beyond our control 
if our schools do not maintain their state authorizations and accreditations  they may not operate or participate in federal student financial aid programs 
a school that grants degrees  diplomas  or certificates must be authorized by the relevant agencies of the state in which it is located and  in some cases  other states where the school is deemed to be operating 
state authorization and accreditation by an accrediting agency recognized by the doe also are required for an institution to participate in the federal student financial aid programs 
requirements for authorization and accreditation vary substantially among the applicable agencies  and some of our schools must satisfy highly detailed standards regarding their educational programs  facilities  faculty  and other matters to maintain the necessary approvals 
loss of state authorization or accreditation by any of our campuses  depending on the size of the campus  could have a material adverse effect on our student population and revenue 
government and regulatory agencies may conduct compliance reviews  bring claims or initiate litigation against us 
because we operate in a highly regulated industry  we are subject to compliance reviews  claims of non compliance or lawsuits by government agencies 
if the results of these reviews or proceedings are unfavorable to us or if we are unable to defend successfully against lawsuits or claims  we may be required to pay money damages or be subject to fines  limitations  loss of federal funding  injunctions  or other criminal or civil penalties 
even if we adequately address issues raised by an agency review or successfully defend a lawsuit or claim by the government  we may have to devote significant financial and management resources to address these issues 
budget constraints in states that provide state financial aid to our students could reduce the amount of such financial aid that is available to our students  which could adversely effect our student population 
a significant number of states are facing budget constraints that are causing them to reduce state appropriations in a number of areas 
those states include california and others that provide financial aid to our students 
we expect that california and other states may decide to reduce the amount of state financial aid that they provide to students  but we cannot predict how significant any of these reductions will be or how long they will last 
if the level of state funding for our students decreases and our students are not able to secure alternative sources of funding  our student population could be adversely affected 
failure to comply with extensive canadian regulations could affect the ability of our canadian schools to participate in canadian financial aid programs 
we derive a majority of our canadian schools revenue from canadian governmental financial aid programs 
depending on their province of residence  canadian students may receive loans under the canada student loans program  the ontario student loans plan  or the quebec loans and bursaries program 
in addition  there are students attending our canadian schools who receive government sponsored financial assistance from provinces other than ontario and quebec 
our canadian schools must meet eligibility standards to administer these programs and must comply with extensive statutes  rules  regulations  and requirements 
each of our ontario schools will be required to share the cost of student loan defaults if defaults by its students on their ontario student assistance plan loans exceed specified rates 
our international academy of design and technology and softtrain schools in toronto currently do not have a default rate that exceeds the applicable threshold of 
however  our international academy of design and technology school in ottawa had an overall default rate of in and has received a letter from the ontario ministry of training  colleges and universities indicating that it may have to share in the costs of defaults and post an additional bond with the ministry 
if our canadian schools cannot meet these and other eligibility standards or fail to comply with applicable requirements  it could have a material adverse effect on our net income 
the canadian  ontario  and quebec governments continuously review the legislative  regulatory  and other requirements relating to student financial assistance programs due to political and budgetary pressures 
although we do not anticipate a significant reduction in the funding for these programs  any change that significantly reduces funding or the ability of our schools to participate in these programs could have a material adverse effect on our student population and revenue 
our ability to conduct business in other foreign countries could be limited if government regulation increases or changes 
our schools in france  the united kingdom and the united arab emirates are subject to extensive local regulations and requirements 
if we are found to be in violation of local regulations  including licensing and accreditation requirements  we could be subject to civil sanctions  including monetary penalties 
additionally  we could be required to incur significant ongoing expenses to comply with these regulatory requirements or  conceivably  could be restricted or barred from providing educational services in that jurisdiction 
please also see business other international regulations for more detailed information on the international regulations that apply to us 
risks specific to our business could have a material adverse effect on us failure to effectively manage our growth could harm our business 
we have grown rapidly since our incorporation in january our continued rapid growth may place a strain on our management  operations  employees  or resources 
we may not be able to maintain or accelerate our current growth rate  effectively manage our expanding operations  or achieve planned growth on a timely or profitable basis 
if we are unable to manage our growth effectively  we may experience operating inefficiencies  and our net income may be materially adversely affected 
if students fail to pay their outstanding balances  our business will be harmed 
we offer a variety of payment plans to help students pay that portion of their education expense not covered by financial aid programs 
these balances are unsecured and not guaranteed 
losses related to unpaid student balances in excess of the amounts we have reserved for bad debts could have a material adverse effect on our business 
failure to effectively identify  pursue  and integrate acquired schools could harm our business 
we expect to continue to rely on acquisitions as a key component of our growth 
from time to time  we engage in  and we are currently engaged in  evaluations of  and discussions with  possible acquisition candidates 
we may not continue to be able to identify suitable acquisition opportunities or to acquire any such schools on favorable terms 
furthermore  we may not be able to successfully integrate any acquired schools into our operations profitably 
acquisitions involve a number of special risks and challenges  including the diversion of management s attention  difficulties in assimilating the operations and personnel of acquired schools  adverse short term effects on reported operating results  possible loss of key employees  and difficulty of presenting a unified corporate image 
continued growth through acquisition may also subject us to unanticipated business or regulatory uncertainties or liabilities 
acquired schools may not enhance our business and  if we do not successfully address associated risks and uncertainties  may ultimately have a material adverse effect on our growth and ability to compete 
opening additional new schools and adding new services could be difficult for us 
we have also grown by opening new schools as additional branches of existing schools 
establishing new schools poses unique challenges and requires us to make investments in management  capital expenditures  marketing expenses  and other resources different  and in some cases greater  than those required with respect to the operation of acquired schools 
when opening a new school  we may be required to obtain appropriate state or provincial and accrediting agency approvals 
in addition  to be eligible for federal student financial aid programs  such a school has to be certified by the doe 
our failure to effectively manage the operations of newly established schools or service areas  or any diversion of management s attention from our core career oriented school operating activities  could harm our business 
we face litigation that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations we and some of our current and former directors and executive officers have been named as defendants in numerous private securities class action lawsuits 
between december  and february   six purported class action lawsuits were filed in the united states district court for the northern district of illinois  alleging that we made certain material misrepresentations and failed to disclose certain material facts about our condition and prospects 
we cannot predict what the outcome of these lawsuits will be 
additionally  in the ordinary conduct of our business  we and our schools are subject to various other lawsuits  investigations and claims  covering a wide range of matters  including  but not limited to  claims involving students or graduates and routine employment matters 
it is possible that we may be required to pay substantial damages or settlement costs in excess of our insurance coverage  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operation 
we could also incur substantial legal costs  and management s attention and resources could be diverted from our business 
please also see legal proceedings for more detailed information on these litigation risks 
failure to keep pace with changing market needs and technology could harm our student population 
prospective employers of our graduates increasingly demand that their entry level employees possess appropriate technological skills 
educational programs at our schools  particularly programs in visual communications and information technology  must keep pace with these evolving requirements 
if we cannot respond to changes in industry requirements  it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to attract students 
we compete with a variety of schools  and if we are unable to compete effectively  our student population and revenue could be harmed 
the postsecondary education market is highly competitive 
our schools compete with traditional public and private two year and four year colleges and universities and other proprietary schools  including those that offer distance learning programs 
some public and private colleges and universities  as well as other private  career oriented schools  offer programs similar to those of our schools 
although tuition at private nonprofit institutions is  on average  higher than tuition at our schools  some public institutions are able to charge lower tuition than our schools  due in part to government subsidies and other financial resources not available to proprietary schools 
some of our competitors in both the public and private sectors have substantially greater financial and other resources than we have 
we may incur increasing costs competing for students 
if we are not able to compete effectively for students  our revenue may decline 
expansion outside of the us  canada  france  the united kingdom  and the united arab emirates could adversely affect our business 
although we currently operate in the us  canada  france  the united kingdom  and the united arab emirates  we intend to explore opportunities outside those markets 
there may be difficulties and complexities associated with our expansion into these other international markets  and our strategies may not succeed beyond our current markets 
international operations present inherent risks  including currency fluctuations  varying political and economic conditions  unanticipated changes in regulation  trade barriers  staffing and management problems  and adverse tax consequences 
also  in further expanding internationally  we would be required to comply with different  and potentially more onerous  regulatory requirements 
if we do not effectively address these risks  our growth and ability to compete may be impaired 
failure to obtain additional capital in the future could reduce our ability to grow 
we believe that funds from operations  cash  investments  borrowings under our million us credit agreement  and borrowings under our million canadian credit agreement will be adequate to fund our current operating plans for the foreseeable future 
however  we may need additional debt or equity financing in order to carry out our strategy of growth through acquisitions 
we may also need additional debt or equity financing in the future to execute our growth strategy 
the amount and timing of such additional financing will vary principally depending on the timing and size of acquisitions and the sellers willingness to provide financing 
to the extent that we require additional financing in the future and are unable to obtain such additional financing  we may not be able to fully implement our growth strategy 
our credit agreement limits our ability to take various actions 
our credit agreement limits our ability to take various actions  including paying dividends and disposing of assets 
accordingly  we may be restricted from taking actions which management believes would be desirable and in the best interests of us and our stockholders 
the credit agreement also requires us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy specified financial tests 
a breach of any covenants contained in the credit agreement could result in an event of default under that agreement and allow the lenders to pursue various remedies  including accelerating the indebtedness outstanding thereunder  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition 
the loss of our key personnel could harm our business 
our success to date has depended  and will continue to depend  largely on the skills and efforts of john m 
larson  our chairman  president  and chief executive officer  patrick k 
pesch  our executive vice president  chief financial officer  treasurer  and secretary  nick fluge  president of our online education group  jacob p 
gruver  group president of our college east  college west  and university divisions  jon r 
coover  group president of our gibbs  health education east  and health education west divisions  paul r 
ryan  group president of our academy  culinary east  and culinary west divisions  todd h 
steele  group president of our international and startup divisions  and steve b 
sotraidis  our executive vice president of administration  and our other key personnel 
our success also depends  in large part  upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified faculty  school presidents and administrators  and corporate management 
due to the nature of our business  we may have difficulty locating and hiring qualified personnel and retaining such personnel once hired 
none of our employees is subject to an employment or noncompetition agreement other than mr 
larson 
we do not maintain life insurance on any of our employees 
the loss of the services of any of our key personnel  or our failure to attract and retain other qualified and experienced personnel on acceptable terms  could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  or financial condition 
in addition  a limited number of our faculty members are represented by unions  although they are not currently subject to collective bargaining agreements 
if we become subject to collective bargaining agreements  our flexibility in making human resources decisions could be impaired 
terrorist attacks and other acts of wider armed conflict may have an adverse effect on the us and world economies and may disrupt our provision of educational services 
terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war  such as those that took place on september   could have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations  or financial condition 
there can be no assurance that there will not be further terrorist attacks against the united states or its businesses or interests 
attacks or armed conflicts that directly impact our physical facilities or ability to recruit foreign students could significantly affect our ability to provide educational services to our students and thereby impair our ability to achieve our expected results 
further  the adverse effects that such violent acts and threats of future attacks could have on the us and world economies could similarly have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  and financial condition 
finally  further terrorist acts could cause the united states to enter into a wider armed conflict which could further impact our operations and result in prospective students  as well as our current students and employees  entering the armed forces 
these factors could cause significant declines in our enrollment and could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  or financial condition 
anti takeover provisions in our charter documents and under delaware law and our stockholders rights plan could make an acquisition of us  which may be beneficial to our stockholders  more difficult 
provisions of our certificate of incorporation and our by laws contain provisions that may delay  defer  or inhibit a future acquisition of us not approved by our board of directors 
these provisions are intended to encourage any person interested in acquiring us to negotiate with and obtain the approval of our board of directors in connection with the transaction 
for example  our certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue up to  shares of preferred stock with such voting  conversion  and other rights  preferences  privileges  and restrictions as it determines  without any further vote or action by our stockholders 
the rights of the holders of our common stock will be subject to  and may be harmed by  the rights of the holders of our preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
in addition  our certificate of incorporation divides our board of directors into three classes having staggered terms 
we are also subject to the provisions of delaware law that could have the effect of delaying  deferring  or preventing a change of control of our company 
one of these provisions prevents us from engaging in a business combination with any interested stockholder for a period of three years from the date the person becomes an interested stockholder  unless specified conditions are satisfied 
we have also implemented a stockholders rights plan  also commonly called a poison pill  that would substantially reduce or eliminate the expected economic benefit to an acquiror from acquiring us in a manner or on terms not approved by our board of directors 
these and other impediments to a third party acquisition or change of control could limit the price investors are willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
risks specific to our online education group s business could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our online education group intends to continue increasing the number of its students and more resources will be required to support this anticipated growth  including additional faculty  enrollment  and academic and financial counselors 
this exceptional growth has placed  and future growth is expected to place  a significant strain on our online education group s operational resources 
the continued development of awareness of the programs offered by our online education group is critical to the continued acceptance and growth of our online education group s programs 
if our online education group is unable to continue to develop awareness of the programs offered by it  this could limit its enrollments and negatively impact its ability to increase revenues and profitability 
our online education group s success depends in part on its ability to expand the content of its programs  develop new programs in a cost effective manner  and meet its students needs in a timely manner 
the expansion of our online education group s existing programs and the development of new programs may not be accepted by its students or the online education market 
the performance and reliability of our online education group s program infrastructure is critical to the reputation of our online education group and its ability to attract and retain students 
any system error or failure  or a sudden and significant increase in traffic  may result in the unavailability of our online education group s computer networks 
individual  sustained  or repeated occurrences could significantly damage the reputation of our online education group and result in a loss of potential or existing students 
additionally  our online education group s computer systems and operations are vulnerable to interruption or malfunction due to events beyond its control  including natural disasters and telecommunications failures 
any interruption to our online education group s computer systems or operations could have a material adverse effect on the ability of our online education group to attract and retain students 
our online education group s computer networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access  computer hackers  computer viruses  and other security problems 
a user who circumvents security measures could misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions or malfunctions in operations 
due to the sensitive nature of the information contained on our online education group s networks  such as students grades  its networks may be targeted by hackers 
as a result  our online education group may be required to expend significant resources to protect against the threat of these security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by these breaches
