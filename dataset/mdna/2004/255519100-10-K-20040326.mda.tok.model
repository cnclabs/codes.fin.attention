item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this report 
overview during and  we sold our carpet yarn extrusion operation  two dyeing facilities  a carpet yarn plant and a number of non operating assets 
in november and early fiscal  we sold substantially all of our remaining assets located in north georgia  including our factory built housing  needlebond  carpet recycling businesses and a carpet spun yarn manufacturing facility to shaw industries group  inc shaw 
financial results for the operations sold to shaw have been classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
the sale transactions significantly reduced our debt  diversified our customer concentration and significantly improved our strategic position 
in essence  we begin as a new company one now focused on its core competencies  committed to its brands and the upper end of the market  with a strong balance sheet  and well positioned to take advantage of an improving economy 
our business is now smaller  but more profitable with greater growth potential 
it is concentrated in segments of the soft floorcovering market  where innovative styling  design  color  quality and service as well as limited distribution are welcomed and rewarded 
through our fabrica  masland  and dixie home brands  we have a significant presence in the high end of the soft floorcovering market 
our candlewick carpet yarn operations supply plied and heat set filament yarns primarily to our carpet manufacturing businesses and sells yarn to independent carpet manufacturers 
critical accounting policies certain estimates and assumptions are made when preparing financial statements 
these estimates and assumptions affect various matters  including amounts reported for assets and liabilities in the company s consolidated balance sheets at the dates of the financial statements  and amounts reported for revenues and expenses in the company s consolidated statements of operations during the reporting periods presented 
estimates involve judgments with respect to  among other things  future economic factors that are difficult to predict 
as a result  actual amounts could differ from estimates made in preparing the financial statements 
the sec has issued disclosure guidance requiring management to identify its most critical accounting policies 
such critical accounting policies are those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and requires our most difficult  subjective  and complex judgments  as a result of the need to make estimates about inherently uncertain matters that may change in subsequent periods 
we believe the following accounting policies require significant judgments and estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements and represent our critical accounting policies 
other significant accounting policies are discussed in note a to our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
revenues are recognized when legal title passes to the customer  which is generally at the time goods are shipped 
accounts receivable 
we provide allowances for expected cash discounts  returns  claims and doubtful accounts based upon historical experience and periodic evaluation of the financial condition of our customers and the collectability of our accounts receivable 
if the financial condition of our customers signficantly deteriorate  or other factors impair their ability to pay their debts  allowances recorded in our financial statements may not be adequate 
customer claims and product warranties 
we provide varying warranties related to our products against manufacturing defects and specific performance standards 
we record reserves related to defective products and performance standards 
the levels of reserves are established based primarily upon historical experience 
significant deviations from historical experience could cause us to under estimate and  therefore  under record related reserves 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using the last in  first out method lifo  which matches current costs with current revenues 
inventories on hand are compared against anticipated future usage  which  to some extent is based on historical usage  in order to evaluate obsolescence and excessive quantities 
additionally  rates of recoverability per unit of inventory related to inventory that is less than first quality  obsolete or excessive are estimated based on historical rates of recoverability 
actual results could differ from assumptions used to value our inventory 
goodwill is subject to annual impairment testing 
the impairment tests are based on determining the fair value of our specified reporting units by estimating the reporting units future cash flows  which requires management judgments and assumptions about future economic factors that are difficult to predict and beyond management s control 
changes in future economic factors or our judgments and assumptions about future economic factors could materially change our estimate of the value of a specified reporting unit and  therefore  could materially impact the value of goodwill and our consolidated financial statements 
self insured accruals 
we accrue for claims related to our self insured medical and dental benefits and workers compensation costs 
accurals related to these costs pertain to known claims  projected future inflationary impacts related to known claims  and estimates of unreported claims 
inflationary factors in the future that are significantly in excess of those used to quantitfy the reserve and claims experience in the future significantly greater than past experience could cause us to under record related accruals 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences related to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to be applicable to future periods when the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities due to a change in the tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period that includes the effective date of the change 
also  taxing jurisdictions could retroactively disagree with our tax treatment of various items in a manner that could affect the tax treatment of such items going forward 
accounting rules require these future effects to be evaluated using existing laws  rules and regulations  each of which is subject to change 
loss contingencies 
we recognize a loss contingency when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
judgment must be applied related to the likelihood of occurrence and the financial impact of an event in terms of its reasonable quantification and related significance 
results of operations our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements that were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the following table sets forth certain elements of results for our continuing operations as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated fiscal year ended december  december  december  net sales cost of sales gross profit selling and administrative expenses impairments and other charges other income expense net operating income loss fiscal year ended december   compared with fiscal year ended december  net sales 
net sales for the year ended december  were million  an increase of over net sales of million for the year ended december  carpet sales in increased million  or  compared with carpet sales 
over half of the increase in was attributable to year over year growth in both the higher end residential and contract markets served by masland and fabrica  with the remainder due to the dixie home collection of products introduced in early carpet yarn sales declined million  or  in as we continue to focus our yarn production capacity to support our internal floorcovering businesses 
cost of sales 
cost of sales in increased by of sales as compared with principally due to a greater portion of our sales increase coming from masland and dixie home products  that have lower gross margins than those of fabrica 
selling and administrative expenses 
selling and administrative expenses were of sales in compared with of sales in the increase is due to the costs of the sales and marketing infrastructure associated with the introduction of the dixie home collection of products and higher than normal sample costs necessary to introduce a new product line 
we anticipate that these expenses as a percentage of sales will decrease as the volume of sales of dixie home products increase 
additionally  we expect sample cost per dollar of sales to decrease as dixie home s business matures 
impairments and other charges 
our results were negatively impacted by million million after tax  or per diluted share of impairments and other charges recorded in the fourth quarter of the year ended december  these charges were principally related to early extinguishments of debt and the write down of assets impaired as a result of the sale of our north georgia operations 
million of the charges were cash prepayment penalties and fees related to debt retired with the sale proceeds and million related to success fees paid to management in connection with the sale transaction 
million of the charges were non cash  including million for impairments of long lived assets and million to write off deferred financing cost 
other income expense net 
other income expense net reflects a decrease of million in compared with as a result of a lower level of gains on asset sales in interest expense 
interest expense was million in compared with million in interest expense is allocated to continuing operations for all periods presented based on the relationship of the net asset value of the assets in our continuing operations to the net asset value of our total assets 
the increase in interest expense in was primarily a result of the payment of a million contingent purchase obligation to the previous owners of fabrica in march of based on the expected debt levels and current interest rates  we expect interest expense to be in the million to million range in income tax provision benefit 
our effective income tax rate was for compared with for the change in the effective tax rates is principally due to the relationship of items of cost that are non deductible for tax purposes to pre tax earnings in each of these reporting periods 
net income loss 
results from continuing operations reflected a loss of million  or per diluted share  in  compared with income from continuing operations of million  or per diluted share  in the after tax effect of impairment and other charges included in results from continuing operations in was a loss of million  or per diluted share 
the net loss for was million  or per diluted share  compared with net income of million  or per diluted share  for the net loss in included a loss of million  or per diluted share  from discontinued operations and a loss of million  or per diluted share  on the disposal of discontinued operations 
results for included a loss of million  or per diluted share  from discontinued operations and a loss of million  or per diluted share  on disposal of discontinued operations  when we wrote off a note received in in connecti on with the sale of our cotton yarn and dyeing textile operations 
fiscal year ended december   compared with fiscal year ended december  net sales 
net sales for the year ended december  were million  a decline of from million for the year ended december  sales in our carpet business increased 
although commercial markets were soft in  sales improved due to growth in our high end residential markets 
sales in our carpet yarn business declined 
the lower carpet yarn sales reflect our strategy to de emphasize our external carpet yarn sales to supply raw materials to support our carpet operations 
cost of sales 
cost of sales decreased significantly in compared with as a result  gross margin increased to for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  this improvement is principally attributable to product mix as we grew our higher margin carpet business and decreased our lower margin carpet yarn business 
in addition  cost reduction programs were implemented during the year ending december   that reduced cost by improving efficiencies and asset utilization 
selling and administrative expenses 
selling and administrative expenses decreased million in the twelve month period ended december   compared with the same period in due to our efforts to control costs in all areas 
other income expense net 
other income expense net reflected million reduction in other income due to a lower level of net gains from asset sales in the year ended december  compared with the year ended december  interest expense 
interest expense decreased for the year ended december   compared with the same period in principally due to lower levels of debt and a lower portion of total interest expense being allocated to continuing operations in fiscal income tax provision benefit 
our effective income tax rate was for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  the change in the effective tax rates is principally due to the relationship of non deductible goodwill amortization and other items of cost that are non deductible for tax purposes to pre tax earnings in each of these reporting periods 
additionally  the year included an income tax benefit of million due to a contribution deduction  for income tax purposes  related to the sale of a carpet yarn facility 
net income loss 
income from continuing operations for fiscal was million  or per diluted share  compared with income from continuing operations of million  or per diluted share  in net income for was million  or per diluted share  and included a loss from discontinued operations of million  or per diluted share  and a loss on disposal of discontinued operations of million  or per diluted share 
this compared with net income of million  or per diluted share  in  and included a loss from discontinued operations of million  or per diluted share 
liquidity and capital resources on march   we issued million of senior secured notes  amended our senior credit facility to reduce the revolving credit loan commitments to million  but increased the effective borrowing availability under the agreement by million  reissued our existing term loan at its outstanding balance  and added an additional million term loan  bringing the aggregate balance of the term loan portion of the facility to million 
the term loans were reduced to million on november  when we sold our north georgia operations 
the term loans are payable in quarterly installments of million beginning february  and are due in may interest rates available under the amended senior facility may be selected from a number of options that effectively allow for borrowing at rates ranging from the lender s prime rate plus to the lender s prime rate plus for base rate loans  or at rates ranging from libor plus to libor plus for libor loans 
com mitment fees  ranging from to per annum  are payable on the average daily unused balance of the revolving credit facility 
the level of our accounts receivable and inventories limits borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility 
the senior credit facility is secured by a first priority lien in substantially all of our assets 
proceeds from the financings were used to settle a million contingent obligation to the former shareholders of fabrica international through a cash payment of million  reflecting an early payment discount 
on november   we sold our factory built housing  needlebond and carpet recycling businesses and related assets to shaw industries group  inc pursuant to an asset purchase agreement that provided for a cash purchase price of million  which  net of liabilities retained by us  resulted in a net value for the transaction of approximately million 
proceeds received at closing  which are subject to certain adjustments  were used to retire approximately million of the company s debt  to fund an million escrow reserve  and to pay certain debt pre payment premiums and transaction related expenses 
approximately million of the proceeds were invested in short term securities were used to pay the retained liabilities and income taxes related to the transaction 
at december   amounts invested in short term securities were million and adequate to pay income taxes relating to the sale 
debt repaid with proceeds from the sale consisted of amounts then outstanding under our senior secured notes of million and our subordinated notes of million 
additionally  we paid million of debt outstanding under our senior credit facility and  in december  reduced the revolving credit commitment to million 
our senior credit agreement contains financial covenants relating to fixed charges  debt coverage and net worth and among other things  limit future acquisitions  capital expenditures  and the payment of dividends 
the company s revolving credit facility provides that the occurrence of any event or condition that has a material adverse effect as defined in the agreement shall constitute an event of default 
the portion of our revolving credit debt that is classified as long term in our balance sheet at december  and december  represents amounts that are not repaid through lockbox remittances 
because the assets sold in november and in early were classified as assets held for sale in the current asset section of our balance sheet  debt retired with the proceeds from the sales was classified in the current liability section of our balance sheet for the applicable periods 
the unused borrowing capacity under our credit facilities on december  was approximately  during the three year period ended december   cash flows generated from operating activities excluding million advanced under our prior accounts receivable securitization were million 
these funds were supplemented by million from asset sales and were used to finance our operations  invest million in capital assets  million in business acquisitions including of contingent payments related to previous acquisitions  retire including million advanced under our prior accounts receivable securitization million of debt  and invest million in short term securities 
proceeds from the sale of assets were million in  million in and million in the assets sold consisted primarily of the sale of our north georgia operations in  a yarn extrusion facility and a carpet yarn facility in  and machinery  dyeing facilities and real estate in capital expenditures for the year were million in continuing operations  including of assets under operating leases that were converted to a capital lease 
during  depreciation and amortization was million million in continuing operations 
we expect capital expenditures to be approximately million for the year  while depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately million 
the fabrica asset purchase agreement provides for a contingent amount of up to million to be paid in april if fabrica s cumulative earnings before interest and taxes for the five year period beginning january exceed certain levels 
we expect that any contingent payments that may become due under the cumulative earnings test would be treated as additional costs of the acquisition 
the acquisition of multitex corporation of america  inc globaltex provides for certain contingent obligations related to revenue growth of a specific customer through the final payment for the obligation under the multitex agreement is expected to be approximately million and will be paid in march we believe our operating cash flows and credit availability under our senior credit facilities are adequate to finance our normal liquidity requirements

certain factors affecting the company s performance in addition to the other information provided in this report  the following risk factors should be considered when evaluating results of our operations  future prospects and an investment in shares of our common stock 
any of these factors could cause our actual financial results during any period to differ materially from our historical results  and could give rise to events that might have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the floorcovering industry is cyclical and prolonged declines in residential or commercial construction activity or corporate remodeling and refurbishment could have a material adverse effect on our business 
the us floorcovering industry is cyclical and is influenced by a number of general economic factors 
the floorcovering industry in general is dependent on residential and commercial construction activity  including new construction as well as remodeling 
new construction is cyclical in nature 
to a somewhat lesser degree  this also is true with residential and commercial remodeling 
a prolonged decline in any of these industries could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the level of activity in these industries is significantly affected by numerous factors  all of which are beyond the our control  including consumer confidence  housing demand  financing availability  national and local economic conditions  interest rates  employment levels  changes in disposable income  commercial rental vacancy rates  and federal and state income tax policies 
we face intense competition in our industry  which could decrease demand for our products and could have a material adverse effect on our profitability 
the floorcovering industry is highly competitive 
we face competition from a number of domestic manufacturers and independent distributors of floorcovering products and  in certain product areas  foreign manufacturers 
there has been a significant consolidation within the floorcovering industry during recent years which has caused a number of our existing and potential competitors to be larger and have greater resources and access to capital than we do 
maintaining our competitive position may require us to make substantial investments in our product development efforts  manufacturing facilities  distribution network and sales and marketing activities  which may be limited by restrictions set forth in our credit facilities 
competitive pressures may also result in decreased demand for our products and in the loss of market share 
in addition  we face  and will continue to face  pressure on sales prices of our products from competitors 
as a result of any of these factors  there could be a mater ial adverse effect on our sales and profitability 
raw material prices may increase 
the cost of raw materials has a significant impact on our profitability 
in particular our business requires the purchase of large volumes of nylon yarn  synthetic backing  wool fibers  latex and dyes 
increases in the cost of these raw materials could materially adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition if we are unable to pass these increases through to our customers 
prices of raw materials increased in early and additional increases have been announced for many raw materials we use 
we believe we will be successful in increasing prices to pass along raw material and other costs  however  there can be no assurance that we will successfully recover such increases in cost 
unanticipated termination or interruption of our arrangements with third party suppliers of nylon yarn could have a material adverse effect on us 
nylon yarn is the principal raw material used in our floorcovering products 
a significant portion of our nylon yarn purchases is from one supplier 
we believe there are other adequate sources of nylon yarns  however  an unanticipated termination or interruption of our supply arrangements could adversely effect our supply arrangements and could be material 
we may be responsible for environmental cleanup costs 
various federal  state and local environmental laws govern the use of our facilities 
these laws govern such matters as discharges to air and water  handling and disposal of solid and hazardous substances and waste  and remediation of contamination from releases of hazardous substances in our facilities and off site disposal locations 
our operations also are governed by laws relating to workplace safety and worker health  which  among other things  establish noise standards and regulate the use of hazardous materials and chemicals in the workplace 
we have taken  and will continue to take  steps to comply with these laws 
if we fail to comply with present or future environmental or safety regulations  we could be subject to future liabilities 
however  we cannot insure that complying with these environmental or health and safety laws and requirements will not adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
future laws  ordinances or regulations could give rise to additional compliance or remediation costs which could have a material adverse affect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
acts of terrorism 
our business could be materially adversely affected as a result of international conflicts or acts of terrorism 
terrorist acts or acts of war may cause damage or disruption to our facilities  employees  customers  suppliers  and distributors  which could have a material adverse affect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
such conflicts also may cause damage or disruption to transportation and communication systems and to our ability to manage logistics in such an environment  including receipt of supplies and distribution of products 
forward looking information this report contains statements that may be considered forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
these statements include the use of terms or phrases that include such terms as expects  estimated  projects  believes  anticipates  intends  and similar terms and phrases 
such terms or phrases relate to  among other matters  our future financial performance  business prospects  growth  strategies or liquidity 
the following important factors may affect our future results and could cause those results to differ materially from our historical results 
these risks include  in addition to those detailed above under the heading certain factors affecting the company s performance  the cost and availability of capital  raw material and transportation costs related to petroleum price levels  the cost and availability of energy supplies  the loss of a significant customer or group of customers  materially adverse changes in economic conditions generally in carpet  rug and floorcovering markets we serve and other risks detailed from time to time in our filings with the securities and exchange commission 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december   the company had an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of  which expires march  under the interest rate swap agreement  the company pays a fixed rate of of interest times the notional amount  and receives in return an amount equal to a specified variable rate of interest times the same notional amount 
any interest rate differential realized is recognized as an adjustment to interest expense over the life of the swap agreement 
based on the company s  interest rate swap agreement  a fluctuation in the variable rate would result in an annual after tax economic impact of approximately
