item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview with the exception of historical information  the matters discussed below under the headings consolidated results of operations for the years ended december   and  segment results  liquidity and capital resources and elsewhere in this annual report include forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  many of which are beyond our control 
readers should be cautioned that a number of important factors  including those identified above in item special note regarding forward looking statements and risks related to our business and our industry may affect actual results and may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated or expected in any forward looking statement 
we develop and manufacture small space and rocket systems for commercial  military and civil government customers 
our primary products are satellites and launch vehicles  including low orbit  geosynchronous and planetary spacecraft for communications  remote sensing  scientific and defense missions  ground and air launched rockets that deliver satellites into orbit  and missile defense systems that are used as interceptor and target vehicles 
we also offer space related technical services to government agencies and develop and build satellite based transportation management systems for public transit agencies and private vehicle fleet operators 
critical accounting policies and significant estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgments based upon estimates and assumptions that are inherently uncertain 
such judgments affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management continuously evaluates its estimates and assumptions  including those related to long term contracts and incentives  inventories  long lived assets  warranty obligations  income taxes  contingencies and litigation  and the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following is a summary of the most critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
our revenue is derived primarily from long term contracts 
revenues on cost reimbursable contracts are recognized to the extent of costs incurred plus a proportionate amount of fee earned 
revenues on long term fixed price contracts are generally recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
such revenues are recorded based on the percentage that costs incurred to date bear to the most recent estimates of total costs to complete each contract 
estimating future costs and  therefore  revenues and profits  is a process requiring a high degree of management judgment  including management s assumptions regarding our future operations as well as general economic conditions 
in the event of a change in total estimated contract cost or profit  the cumulative effect of such change is recorded in the period the change in estimate occurs 
frequently  the period of performance of a contract extends over a long period of time and  as such  revenue recognition and our profitability from a particular contract may be adversely affected to the extent that estimated cost to complete or incentive or award fee estimates are revised  delivery schedules are delayed or progress under a contract is otherwise impeded 
accordingly  our recorded revenues and gross profits from period to period can fluctuate significantly 
in the event cost estimates indicate a loss on a contract  the 
table of contents total amount of such loss  excluding general and administrative expense  is recorded in the period in which the loss is first estimated 
certain contracts include incentive provisions for increased or decreased revenue and profit based on actual performance against established targets 
incentive and award fees are included in estimated contract revenue at the time the amounts can be reasonably determined and are reasonably assured based on historical experience and other objective criteria 
should our performance under such contracts differ from previous assumptions  current period revenues would be adjusted 
inventory is stated at the lower of cost or estimated market value 
estimated market value is determined based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those previously projected by management  inventory write downs may be required 
we self construct some of our ground and airborne support equipment and special test equipment utilized in the manufacture  production and delivery of some of our products 
we capitalize direct costs incurred in constructing such equipment and certain allocated indirect costs 
recovery of these capitalized costs is subject to the continuation of certain of our long term contracts and could be adversely impacted by technological changes and innovations 
we record a liability in connection with various warranty obligations 
our warranty obligations are affected by product failure rates and material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  a reduction in the deferred tax valuation allowance would be recorded as a tax benefit 
in making such a determination  we would consider a number of factors including historical financial results and forecasted taxable income over future years 
a reduction in the deferred tax valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination is made  and in subsequent periods we would record tax provisions based upon pretax income 
consolidated results of operations for the years ended december   and revenues our consolidated revenues were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
consolidated revenues increased in due to increased revenues in our launch vehicles and advanced programs segment  partially offset by lower revenues in our satellites and related space systems and our transportation management systems formerly know as electronic systems segments  as discussed more fully in segment results below 
consolidated revenues increased in primarily as a result of revenue growth in our launch vehicles and advanced programs and our satellites and related space systems segments 
gross profit our consolidated gross profit was million of revenues  million of revenues and million of revenues in  and  respectively 
gross profit is affected by a number of factors  including the mix of contract types and costs incurred thereon in relation to revenues recognized 
such costs include the costs of personnel  materials  subcontracts and overhead 
gross profit in compared to increased by million in our launch vehicles and advanced programs segment and by million in our satellites and related space systems segment  
table of contents partially offset by a million decrease in gross profit in our transportation management systems segment 
the increase in gross profit in our launch vehicles and advanced systems segment was largely attributable to increased revenues and profit in our orbital boost vehicle obv missile defense interceptor program and in our space launch vehicle product line 
the increase in gross profit in our satellites and related space systems segment was largely attributable to increased gross profit from our geosynchronous satellite product line 
the decrease in gross profit in our transportation management systems segment was largely attributable to significant increases in the first half of in the estimated costs to complete a number of contracts 
under percentage of completion accounting for long term fixed price contracts  the increased estimates of future costs reduce current revenues and profit recognition because higher future costs mean less progress has been achieved currently toward completion of the contracts 
the lower level of progress toward completion of the contracts results in a smaller portion of the total revenues and profits on contracts that are earned and recorded currently 
gross profit in improved significantly compared to gross profit in as a result of increased revenues  the absence in of certain charges recorded in and a reduction in contract losses in in our satellite manufacturing business 
gross profit in was adversely affected by a million charge in the fourth quarter of to write down inventory related to the orbview satellite we were constructing for our former affiliate  orbital imaging corporation orbimage  and to accrue for the expected remaining costs to complete this contract and by million of other contract related charges 
gross profit in was also adversely impacted by cost overruns and contract losses related to certain other satellite construction contracts 
these charges and contract losses in were partially offset by a million favorable revenue and gross profit adjustment as a result of a contract settlement reached with the national aeronautics and space administration nasa on a contract that was terminated for convenience in march research and development expenses research and development expenses represent our self funded product research and development activities and exclude direct customer funded development activities 
research and development expenses were million of revenues  million of revenues and million of revenues in  and  respectively 
research and development expenses increased in compared to primarily as a result of enhancements to our star satellite and development activity on a modified taurus space launch vehicle 
research and development expenses in decreased compared to primarily due to completion of development activity on two advanced programs and lower expenditures on certain satellite development programs  offset partially by increased development activity on the above mentioned modified taurus space launch vehicle 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses were million of revenues  million of revenues and million of revenues in  and  respectively 
selling  general and administrative expenses include the costs of marketing  advertising  promotional and other selling expenses  as well as the costs of our finance  legal  administrative and general management functions 
the slight decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses from to was largely due to lower general and administrative expenses in our satellite manufacturing business  offset partially by higher general support costs in connection with our obv missile defense interceptor program and increased bid and proposal activity on advanced programs 
in addition  in we settled an action we had brought against certain of our insurers seeking reimbursement for defense and settlement costs we had incurred prior to defending a breach of contract lawsuit 
proceeds 
table of contents to us under the settlement were million  of which million was recorded as a reduction of previously recorded general and administrative expenses and million was recorded as a reduction of settlement expense in the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses from to was primarily attributable to certain charges in that included a million provision for unoccupied office space and facility sublease losses and a million provision for estimated unrecoverable amounts related to the orbview satellite construction program  offset partly by the reversal of a million provision initially recorded in for receivables on a contract that was terminated for convenience by nasa in march amortization of goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 which was effective for us beginning in  goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized  but are reviewed at least annually for impairment 
accordingly  the amortization of goodwill was discontinued as of january  goodwill amortization expense was million for settlement expense in  we recorded expenses of million in connection with a settlement agreement with orbimage relating to certain litigation with them 
also during  as discussed above within the caption selling  general and administrative expenses  we recorded a million reduction of settlement expense in connection with the settlement of an action we had brought against certain of our insurers seeking reimbursement for defense and settlement costs we had incurred prior to defending a breach of contract lawsuit 
in  we agreed to settle several disputes that were the subject of arbitration proceedings 
the company recorded charges totaling million in for these litigation related settlements 
interest expense interest expense was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
no interest has been capitalized since interest expense included million  million and million of amortization of debt issuance costs in  and  respectively 
interest expense in and also included million and million  respectively  of amortization of debt discount related to our million notes that were issued in august and were repurchased or redeemed in full in the third quarter of excluding amortization of debt issuance costs and debt discount  interest expense increased million in as compared to primarily because during the first eight months of we incurred lower interest on our convertible notes that were refinanced with higher rate debt in august similarly excluding amortization of debt issuance costs and debt discount  interest expense decreased million in as compared to primarily due to one time fees incurred in related to our prior credit facilities and due to lower average borrowings in  partially offset by the impact of higher interest rates on our borrowings in as compared to other income  net other income  net  was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
interest income and realized gains and losses on investments included in other income totaled million  million and million for  and  respectively 
other income in included million of insurance proceeds that we received related to the bsat b satellite launch failure in july 
table of contents allocated share of losses of affiliates we did not record any income or loss from unconsolidated affiliates in or the allocated share of losses of unconsolidated affiliates in was as follows in thousands orbimage orbcomm other as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements  through june   we recognized of the losses of our former affiliate  orbimage  including preferred stock dividends  in allocated share of losses of affiliates in our statements of operations 
no such losses were recognized in  or in the second half of we accounted for our limited partnership interest in our former affiliate  orbcomm global  lp orbcomm  using the equity method of accounting through as a result of orbcomm s chapter filing in  we wrote off our investment in orbcomm in and we ceased recognizing equity losses for orbcomm 
orbcomm s liquidating plan of reorganization became effective in the fourth quarter of in connection with confirmation of the reorganization plan  we contributed approximately million shares of our common stock to the orbcomm estate and recorded a million charge for the fair value of such shares 
gain on reversal of allocated losses of affiliate in  we recorded a million gain in connection with the reversal of our previously recorded liability related to the allocated losses of orbimage 
this gain was recorded as a result of the cancellation of our ownership interest upon the consummation of orbimage s chapter plan of reorganization in december  as further discussed in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
debt extinguishment expense we recorded million in debt extinguishment expenses during the third quarter of associated with our debt refinancing in july  as further described in liquidity and capital resources 
the debt extinguishment expenses consisted of million in accelerated amortization of debt discount on our notes issued in august  million in accelerated amortization of debt issuance costs and million in prepayment premiums and other expenses 
benefit provision for income taxes in  we recorded a  tax benefit related to the refund of state taxes 
in  we recorded a  provision for income taxes in connection with the initial estimated state income tax liability 
we did not record a provision for us federal income taxes in or because we utilized prior net operating losses to offset all us federal taxable income 
we did not record an income tax benefit in related to the loss from continuing operations for that period because such benefit could not be reasonably assured from future operating results 
for the years ended december  and  we concluded that a full deferred tax valuation allowance is required for the net deferred tax assets  based on our assessment that the realization of those assets does not meet the more likely than not criterion under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
however  it is possible that the more likely than not criterion could be met in or a future period  which could result in the reversal of a significant portion or all of the valuation allowance  which  at that time  would be recorded as a tax benefit in the consolidated statement of operations 

table of contents income loss from continuing operations before cumulative effect of change in accounting our consolidated income loss from continuing operations before cumulative effect of change in accounting was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the increase in income from continuing operations before cumulative effect of change in accounting in as compared to was primarily due to increased operating income in the million improvement in relative to was primarily due to improved operating results and lower interest expense in  in addition to the absence in of allocated share of losses of an affiliate  which totaled million in discontinued operations during  we sold our interests in several businesses  as described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
these transactions and certain prior disposal activity resulted in net gains of million and million in and  respectively  reported in discontinued operations 
cumulative effect of change in accounting in connection with our adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we recorded a million impairment loss in in our transportation management systems segment to write off the remaining net book value of goodwill in this segment 
the impairment loss was determined based on a comparison of the fair value of our transportation management systems reporting unit to its carrying value  including goodwill 
the fair value of our transportation management systems reporting unit  and the resulting implied fair value of goodwill  were estimated after consideration of letters of interest in respect of purchase offers received by us in early during our attempts to sell the transportation management systems business 
the impairment loss was recorded as a january  cumulative effect of a change in accounting 
net income our net income for was million  or per diluted share  as compared to million  or per share  for and million  or per share  for the increase in net income from to was primarily related to increased operating income and the absence in of the million goodwill impairment charge for discussed above 
the decrease in net income from to was attributable to the million increase in income from continuing operations which was more than offset by the impact of the million goodwill impairment charge and the decreased income from discontinued operations 
segment results our products and services are grouped into three reportable segments i launch vehicles and advanced programs  ii satellites and related space systems and iii transportation management systems formerly known as electronic systems 
consolidating eliminations and transactions not attributable to or allocated to any segment are reported in corporate and other 
the following tables 
table of contents summarize revenues and income loss from operations from our reportable business segments and corporate and other in thousands years ended december  revenues launch vehicles and advanced programs satellites and related space systems transportation management systems corporate and other total income loss from operations launch vehicles and advanced programs satellites and related space systems transportation management systems corporate and other settlement expense total launch vehicles and advanced programs revenues increased by in as compared to in large part as a result of increased revenues in our obv missile defense interceptor program 
we are developing and manufacturing interceptor boost vehicles for the us missile defense agency s ground based midcourse defense system under a contract with the boeing company 
during the first quarter of  we successfully launched the first prototype of the obv interceptor 
during the third quarter of  we successfully launched the second obv interceptor 
the obv program accounted for million in revenues  or almost of total segment revenues in  as compared to million in revenues in our space launch vehicle product line also contributed to the year over year increase in revenues  largely due to increased pegasus launch vehicle activity and work on a contract begun in to build three minotaur space launch vehicles for the us department of defense 
we completed four successful pegasus launches during compared to one pegasus launch in higher revenues from our advanced programs in likewise contributed to increased segment revenues 
these revenue increases were offset partially by decreased revenues in our suborbital target vehicle product line  which had fewer launches in than in revenues in this segment increased in as compared to due primarily to growth in revenues on our obv missile defense interceptor program 
this contract generated million and million of revenues in and  respectively 
additionally  continuing progress on several suborbital programs and a new taurus launch vehicle contract for an international customer contributed to the increase in launch vehicle revenues  offset partially by a reduction in pegasus launch vehicle revenues in these increases were partially offset by a reduction in advanced programs revenues in due primarily to a million favorable revenue and income adjustment recorded in related to a contract that was terminated for convenience by nasa in march 
table of contents operating income increased by approximately in as compared to primarily due to the increased profits from the obv missile defense interceptor program  our advanced programs and our space launch vehicle product line 
operating income from the obv missile defense interceptor program accounted for approximately half of the total operating profit in this segment in the increase in our advanced programs was largely attributable to a favorable contract close out 
the increase in operating income in our space launch vehicle product line for versus was largely attributable to increased operating income from pegasus launch vehicle programs  partially offset by a decrease in operating income from a taurus program 
the taurus program experienced significant cost increases and a schedule delay in the fourth quarter of the operating margin in this segment as a percentage of revenues was in  compared to in operating income for launch vehicles and advanced programs increased in by million  or  as compared to primarily attributable to the operating income contributed by the obv missile defense interceptor program  in addition to increases in operating income in on several other programs and the absence of million in other contract related charges recorded in these increases in were offset in part by reductions in our pegasus space launch services activity and by cost growth on the supersonic sea skimming target ssst development program for the us navy 
further  operating income for advanced programs decreased in as compared to primarily due to the adjustment recorded in related to a contract that was terminated for convenience by nasa in march  as discussed above  partially offset by lower research and development expenses in and the absence of a litigation settlement charge recorded in additionally  the absence of goodwill amortization in  which was million in  contributed to greater operating income in the operating margin as a percentage of revenue was in  compared to in satellites and related space systems revenues from satellites and related space systems decreased by approximately during compared to primarily due to a decline in revenues from our geosynchronous geo communications satellite product line and our technical services business  offset partially by increased revenues from our science  technology and military satellite product line 
our geo communications satellite product line revenues were million in as compared to million in this decrease in the product line s revenues was primarily attributable to lower revenues on our panamsat contract  which was approximately complete as of year end  and the absence in of revenues from the n starc satellite that was completed in mid this decline was offset partially by increased revenue on our telkom satellite contract order received in the second half of the increase in our science  technology and military satellite product line revenues was largely attributable to work on two new scientific satellite contracts begun during revenues from satellites and related space systems increased in as compared to from million to million due to increases in all of our major satellite and related space systems product lines 
the largest increase was from our geo communications satellite product line with revenues increasing from million in to million in the increase was primarily attributable to production work on three new satellite orders received in late  offset by lower revenues in from the n starc contract that was completed in the third quarter of as well as lower revenues from two bsat satellites that were completed in in our science  technology and military satellite product line  revenues increased million in primarily due to production work on a new scientific satellite contract received in early  offset partially by a decrease in revenue due to completion of a scientific satellite for nasa 
our technical services product line and other revenues increased by million  primarily due to work performed in on a us government research contract 

table of contents operating income increased from million to million  or  in as compared to largely as a result of improved operating results in the geo communications satellite product line attributable primarily to increased profits from our bsat c and telkom satellite contracts  together with the absence in of a loss from the n starc satellite that was launched in mid also contributing to the increase in operating income in this segment was higher operating income in our science  technology and military satellite product line  primarily attributable to income from two new scientific satellite contracts begun during in addition  operating income for included three transactions that largely offset each other 
first  we recorded charges totaling million for increases in the costs to complete the orbview satellite contract 
second  during we received a million fee associated with the cancellation of a commercial geo satellite contract 
the contract was executed in early  and the customer cancelled the contract in march as a result of changes to the customer s strategy and plans prior to the commencement of any work on this satellite 
third  we recorded the impact of the million proceeds received in connection with the litigation settlement further discussed in settlement expense under consolidated results of operations for the years ended december   and above 
the litigation settlement resulted in an approximately million improvement in operating income in  after considering the impact of the settlement on contract profits on a percentage of completion basis 
the operating margin in this segment as a percentage of revenues improved to in as compared to for the operating results in our satellites and related space systems segment improved from an operating loss of million in to an operating profit of million in this improvement was due to a number of factors 
first  operating results improved due to a reduction in losses and non recurring development and production costs in our communications satellite product line  primarily associated with the n starc and bsat geo satellite programs 
the launch failure of the bsat b satellite in contributed to the operating loss in the communications satellite product line in we received insurance proceeds in connection with the launch failure  however  these proceeds were recorded in in other income  net  as discussed above in other income  net under consolidated results of operations for the years ended december    and second  our science  technology and military satellite product line experienced significant improvement primarily driven by the absence in of a loss recorded in connection with the launch failure of the orbview quiktoms mission in and a significant reduction in charges related to the orbview program 
in the fourth quarter of we recorded a million charge for the expected remaining costs to complete the orbview satellite  and in the fourth quarter of we recorded a million charge to write down inventory and accrue for the expected remaining costs to complete this satellite 
third  our technical services product line improved in as compared to largely due to the sale of satellite inventory that had previously been fully reserved 
finally  beginning in  goodwill amortization was no longer recorded  resulting in an operating profit improvement of million 
transportation management systems revenues in our transportation management systems segment decreased from million to million  or approximately  in as compared to primarily due to a reduction in activity on several contracts that were nearing completion at the end of  offset partially by increased revenue on one current contract 
also contributing to the revenue decrease in were inventory related charges totaling million and unfavorable adjustments totaling million in the second quarter of to the percentage of completion of several contracts as a result of increases in the estimated total costs to complete the contracts 
the growth in the estimated costs to complete the contracts was largely due to increased anticipated costs associated with development  testing and deployment of software 

table of contents revenues from our transportation management systems segment in were approximately the same as revenues from this segment in revenues earned in on new contracts awarded in late and early were offset by decreased revenues in from various existing contracts 
our transportation management systems segment reported a million loss in compared to operating income of million in the operating loss in was primarily due to the unfavorable contract and inventory adjustments described above 
operating income from our transportation management systems segment decreased million in as compared to primarily as a result of charges totaling million in to write down excess inventory offset in part by the absence in of goodwill amortization  which was million in corporate and other corporate and other revenues are comprised solely of the elimination of intercompany revenues 
corporate and other expenses include corporate general and administrative activities that are not attributable to or allocated to the operating segments  as well as consolidating adjustments for intercompany contracts 
corporate and other expenses in included a million provision for potentially unrecoverable amounts related to the orbview satellite construction program and a million provision for unoccupied office space and facility sublease losses 
additionally  corporate and other expenses for included corporate general and administrative expenses attributed to discontinued operations 
liquidity and capital resources cash flow from operating activities cash flow from continuing operations in was million  as compared to a negative million in and a negative million in the net cash flow provided by operating activities in was primarily attributable to cash generated from operations and a million increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities  offset partially by a million increase in receivables and an million reduction in deferred revenues 
in addition  cash flow from continuing operations in included a million add back to  and a million subtraction from  net income from continuing operations associated with the previously discussed debt extinguishment expenses and reversal of allocated losses of affiliate  respectively 
in  the million net use of cash for continuing operations was primarily attributable to cash used to fund our operations together with a reduction in accounts payable  largely attributable to the payment of a million vendor financing obligation 
the million of cash used in continuing operations in was primarily attributable to our operating loss and a million increase in receivables 
cash flow from investing activities in  we spent million for capital expenditures and we increased restricted cash by million for letters of credit issued by a financial institution on our behalf 
these uses of cash were partially offset by a million cash receipt from an escrow account related to the sale of a previously divested business 
in  we used million for capital expenditures and we received million from an escrow account related to the sale of the previously divested business 
in  we received net proceeds of million from the sales of discontinued businesses and we used million for capital expenditures 
cash flow from financing activities in  we used million to pay long term debt obligations and we received million net proceeds from issuances of long term debt  primarily 
table of contents associated with the july financing transactions described more fully below 
in addition  we received million net proceeds from issuances of common stock in connection with stock purchases from employees under our employee stock purchase plan and from the exercise of stock options and warrants 
in  we received million in net proceeds from issuances of long term debt and warrants and million from issuances of common stock and we expended million in principal payments on long term debt 
the net proceeds from issuances of long term debt and warrants included million in net proceeds from our sale of notes and warrants in august and million in net proceeds from a term loan 
principal payments on long term debt consisted primarily of the prepayment of a million term loan and our million subordinated convertible notes  which were due in  and million of principal payments on capital leases and other debt 
the cash received from the issuances of shares of common stock was attributable to issuances under our employee stock purchase plan and the exercise of stock options and warrants 
in  we used million for our financing activities 
during  we repaid a prior primary credit facility using cash proceeds from the sales of businesses as required under the terms of that credit facility 
on july   we closed two financing transactions 
in the first transaction  we issued million of unsecured senior notes due with interest payable semi annually each january and july  starting in during the third quarter of  we used the net proceeds from this offering  together with available cash on hand  to repurchase or redeem all of our million second priority secured notes due in the second transaction  we replaced our previous million revolving line of credit with a new four year  million revolving credit facility the revolver with bank of america serving as the lead arranger in a syndicated line of credit 
the revolver bears interest at rates ranging from to over libor for libor loans or from to over a base rate related to the prime rate for base rate loans  varying according to our ratio of total debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
the revolver is collateralized by substantially all of our assets 
the revolver also permits us to reserve up to million of the facility for letters of credit  foreign exchange contracts or other arrangements 
as of december   there were no borrowings under the revolver  although million of standby letters of credit were issued under the revolver 
as of december   million of the revolver was available for borrowing 
in connection with these two financing transactions  we recorded million of debt extinguishment expenses in  which was comprised of accelerated amortization of unamortized debt discount of million on our notes  accelerated amortization of debt issuance costs of million and million in prepayment premiums and other expenses 
the new senior notes and the revolver contain covenants limiting our ability to  among other things  incur more debt  redeem or repurchase orbital stock  enter into transactions with affiliates  merge or consolidate with others and dispose of assets or create liens on assets 
the revolver contains an absolute prohibition and the new senior notes contain restrictions on the payment of cash dividends 
in addition  the revolver contains financial covenants with respect to leverage  secured leverage  minimum cash balance  fixed charge coverage and consolidated net worth 
during the third quarter of  we entered into an eight year interest rate swap agreement with a financial institution on a notional amount of million  whereby we receive fixed rate interest of in exchange for variable interest payments 
the interest rate is reset quarterly and is equal to the month libor rate plus 
the total variable interest rate was at december  
table of contents this arrangement has been designated an effective fair value hedge of million of our senior notes 
as of december   the fair value of the interest rate swap was million  which was recorded in other non current assets with an equal fair value adjustment recorded on million of the senior notes 
available cash and future funding at december   we had million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents 
management believes that available cash  cash expected to be generated from operations and borrowing capacity under the revolver will be sufficient to fund our operating and capital expenditure requirements in the foreseeable future 
however  there can be no assurance that this will be the case 
our ability to borrow additional funds is limited by the terms of our outstanding debt 
additionally  significant unforeseen events such as termination of major orders or late delivery or failure of launch vehicle or satellite products could adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations 
aggregate contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements the following summarizes orbital s contractual obligations at december   both on and off balance sheet  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in millions payments due by period less than to to more than total year years years years long term debt capital leases operating leases purchase obligations other long term liabilities total our obligations under operating leases consist of minimum rental commitments under non cancelable operating leases primarily for office space and equipment 
purchase obligations consist of open purchase orders that we had issued to acquire materials  parts or services in future periods 
occasionally  certain contracts require us to post performance bonds or letters of credit supporting our performance and refund obligations under the contracts 
we had million of standby letters of credit outstanding at december   of which million was collateralized by our restricted cash and cash equivalents and million was issued under the revolver 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at december   we had total receivables of approximately million denominated in japanese yen and million denominated in singapore dollars 
we are subject to market risk to the extent that future fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates impact these receivables 
from time to time  we enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge against foreign currency fluctuations on receivables denominated in foreign currency 
at december   we had no foreign currency forward exchange contracts 

table of contents the fair market value of our million of unsecured senior notes due was estimated at approximately million at december   based on market trading activity 
during the third quarter of  we entered into an eight year interest rate swap agreement with a financial institution on a notional amount of million  whereby we receive fixed rate interest of in exchange for variable interest payments 
the interest rate is reset quarterly and is equal to the month libor rate plus 
the total variable interest rate was at december  this arrangement has been designated an effective fair value hedge of million of our senior notes due as of december   the fair value of the interest rate swap was million  which was recorded in other non current assets with an equal fair value adjustment recorded on the million of senior notes
