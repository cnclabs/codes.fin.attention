item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we currently operate in two reportable business segments visiting nurses and adult day health services adhs 
we present financial information for our two operating segments in note to our consolidated financial statements 
our visiting nurse segment provides skilled medical services in patients homes largely to enable recipients to reduce or avoid periods of hospitalization and or nursing home care 
approximately of our visiting nurse segment revenues are generated from the medicare program  which is the federal government s health insurance program covering most us citizens over age our medicare revenues are generated on a per episode basis rather than a fee per visit or day of care 
our adhs segment is made up of our adc in center operations and in home personal care operations also referred to as personal care  both of which predominantly provide long term health care and custodial services that enable recipients to avoid nursing home admission 
sources of reimbursement  reimbursement rates per day and contribution margins from our adc and personal care operations are substantially alike 
a majority of our revenues in the adhs segment are derived from medicaid programs which are funded and administered by states in conjunction with federal oversight 
medicaid programs generally provide health insurance coverage to low income aged and or disabled persons 
as we move forward in the execution of our business plan  we may change the way in which we are organized and operate 
our view on reimbursement and diversification of risk our company is highly dependent on government reimbursement programs which pay for the majority of the services we provide to our patients 
reimbursement under these programs  primarily medicare and medicaid  is subject to frequent changes as policy makers balance their own needs to meet the health care needs of constituents while also meeting their fiscal objectives 
we believe that an important key to our historical success and to our future success is our ability to adapt our operations to meet changes in reimbursement as they occur 
one important way in which we have achieved this adaptability in the past  and in which we plan to achieve it in the future  is to maintain some level of diversification in our business mix 
the execution of our business plan will increase the emphasis we place on our visiting nurse operations 
our adult day health services operations will help us maintain a level of diversification of reimbursement risk that we believe is appropriate 
our business plan our future success depends on our ability to execute our business plan 
over the next three to five years we will try to accomplish the following o generate meaningful same store sales growth through the focused provision of high quality services and attending to the needs of our patients  o expand the significance of our visiting nurse  medicare based  home health services by selectively acquiring other quality providers  and o expand our capital base through both earnings performance and by seeking additional capital investments in our company 
based on our business plan  we expect our visiting nurse revenues to grow from under one third of total revenues to about one half of total revenues sometime in the next three to five years 
critical accounting policies the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
when more than one accounting principle  or the method of its application  is generally accepted  we select the principle or method that is appropriate in the specific circumstances 
application of these accounting principles requires us to make estimates about the future resolution of existing uncertainties  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
in preparing these financial statements  we have made our best estimates and judgments of the amounts and disclosures included in the financial statements  giving due regard to materiality 
receivables and revenue recognition we recognize revenues when patient services are provided 
our receivables and revenues are stated at amounts estimated by us to be their net realizable values 
the company is paid for its services primarily by federal and state third party reimbursement programs  commercial insurance companies  and patients 
revenues are recorded at established rates in the period during which the services are rendered 
appropriate allowances to give recognition to third party payment arrangements are recorded when the services are rendered 
laws and regulations governing the medicare and medicaid programs are extremely complex and subject to interpretation 
it is common for issues to arise related to the determination of cost reimbursed revenues  medical coding  particularly with respect to medicare  patient eligibility  particularly related to medicaid  and other reasons unrelated to credit risk  all of which may result in adjustments to recorded revenue amounts 
management continuously evaluates the potential for revenue adjustments and when appropriate provides allowances for losses based upon the best available information 
there is at least a reasonable possibility that recorded estimates could change by material amounts in the near term 
allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on certain factors  such as payor types  historical collection trends and aging categories 
we calculate our reserve for bad debts based on the length of time that the receivables are past due 
the percentage applied to the receivable balances in the various aging categories is based on historical collection experience 
insurance programs we bear significant insurance risk under our large deductible automobile and workers compensation insurance programs and our self insured employee health program 
under our automobile insurance program  we bear risk up to  per incident 
under our workers compensation insurance program  we bear risk up to  per incident 
we purchase stop loss insurance for our employee health plan that places a specific limit  generally  on our exposure for any individual covered life 
malpractice and general patient liability claims for incidents which may give rise to litigation have been asserted against us by various claimants 
the claims are in various stages of processing and some may ultimately be brought to trial 
we also know of incidents that have occurred through december  that may result in the assertion of additional claims 
we carry insurance coverage for this exposure  however  our deductible per claim increased from  to  effective july  and to  effective april  we record estimated liabilities for our insurance programs based on information provided by the third party plan administrators  historical claims experience  the life cycle of claims  expected costs of claims incurred but not paid  and expected costs to settle unpaid claims 
we monitor our estimated insurance related liabilities on a quarterly basis 
as facts change  it may become necessary to make adjustments that could be material to our results of operations and financial condition 
we believe that our present insurance coverage is adequate 
however  due to insurance market conditions  we expect to bear significant cost increases and higher deductibles upon renewal on april  we are currently contemplating alternatives including potentially accepting additional self insurance risk in lieu of higher premium costs 
impairment of property  equipment and intangible assets we evaluate our property and equipment and intangible assets on a periodic basis to determine if facts and circumstances suggest that the assets may be impaired or the estimated useful life of the assets may need to be changed 
we consider internal and external factors of the individual facility or asset  including changes in the regulatory environment  changes in national health care trends  current period cash flow loss combined with a history of cash flow losses and local market developments 
if these factors and the projected undiscounted cash flow of the facility or asset over the asset s remaining life indicate that the carrying value of the asset will not be recovered  the carrying value will be adjusted to its fair value if it is lower 
there were no impairment charges recorded during the year ended december   however  if the projections or our assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges not previously recorded for our assets 
in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations sfas and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
these statements established new accounting and reporting standards for business combinations and associated goodwill and intangible assets 
sfas eliminated the pooling of interest method of accounting and amortization of goodwill for business combinations initiated after june  sfas  effective january   requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives can no longer be amortized  but instead must be tested for impairment at least annually 
we completed the required initial test for impairment upon adoption in and concluded that no impairment exists 
in addition  we completed the required annual tests for impairment in and and concluded that no impairment exists 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
this statement supercedes sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and the accounting and reporting provisions for apb opinion no 
 reporting results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
sfas requires that one accounting model be used for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  whether previously held and used or newly acquired  and it broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions 
we adopted sfas on january   and there was no effect on our financial position and results of operations 
accounting for income taxes as of december   we have net deferred tax assets of approximately  the net deferred tax asset is composed of approximately  of long term deferred tax assets and  of long term deferred tax liabilities 
we have provided a valuation allowance against certain net deferred tax assets based upon our estimation of realizability of those assets through future taxable income 
this valuation was based in large part on our history of generating operating income or losses in individual tax locales and expectations for the future 
our ability to generate the expected amounts of taxable income from future operations is dependent upon general economic conditions  competitive pressures on revenues and margins and legislation and regulation at all levels of government 
we have considered the above factors in reaching our conclusion that it is more likely than not that future taxable income will be sufficient to fully utilize the net deferred tax assets net of the valuation allowance as of december  however  there can be no assurances that we will meet our expectations of future taxable income 
during the year ended december   we recorded in income from discontinued operations  a one time reduction in estimated tax liabilities of approximately  or per diluted share  due to the expiration of various statutory limitations pertaining to the tax year in which we sold our product operations 
seasonality visiting nurse segment our visiting nurse segment operations located in florida normally experience higher admissions during the march quarter than in the other quarters due to seasonal population fluctuations 
adhs segment our adhs segment normally experiences seasonality in its operating results 
specifically  the quarters ended december and march typically generate lower operating income than the quarters ended june and september as the holiday season and winter weather tend to temporarily lower adc in center attendance  particularly in maryland and connecticut

our visiting nurse segment revenues grew primarily due to increased patient volumes of about 
our acquisition of medlink oh accounted for approximately million of revenue growth in adhs 
a variety of other factors led to adhs revenue decreases  the most significant factor being the impact of spending reductions in the kentucky medicaid program  as described in the adhs segment discussion below 
operating income before unallocated corporate expense decreased from the same period last year primarily as a result of the visiting nurse medicare rate cut and spending reductions in the kentucky medicaid program in adhs 
unallocated corporate expenses in included approximately  consisting primarily of professional fees  related to the cost of conducting our investigation into the restatement of our financial statements as disclosed in our form k for the nine months ended december  it is possible that additional costs related to the investigation may be incurred in future periods 
interest expense in was lower than in as a result of lower interest rates and lower average borrowings 
in the year ending december we closed adult day care centers located in frankfort ky  evansville in  and lanham md 
in december  we closed adult day care centers located in seymour ct  mentor oh  and miami fl 
those centers generated after tax operating losses of approximately  per diluted share and  per diluted share in the years ended december  and  respectively 
the closing of these centers had a total property loss of  the remaining property losses resulted primarily from the sale of our building in ft 
myers  fl for a net loss of  and a leasehold improvement loss of  related to the relocation of our owensboro adc center 
our effective income tax rate for continuing operations was approximately of income before income taxes for as compared to an effective income tax rate of approximately for the lower tax rate in is primarily a result of changes in the distribution of taxable income and losses in the various state and local jurisdictions in which we operate 
visiting nurse segment year ended december  and our visiting nurse segment provides skilled medical services in patients homes to enable recipients to reduce or avoid periods of hospitalization and or nursing home care 
approximately of the visiting nurse segment revenues come from the medicare program and are generated on a per episode basis rather than a daily fee basis as in adhs 
in addition to our focus on operating income from the visiting nurse segment  we also measure this segment s performance in terms of admissions  patient months of care  revenue per patient month and cost of services per patient month

had that rate cut gone into effect on january  revenues for would have been lower by approximately  additionally  effective april   our medicare rates for patients served in rural areas were reduced which lowered revenues by approximately  for the year ended december  in october medicare rates were increased by 
despite the net effective rate cuts  our visiting nurse revenues grew by a net  or on admission and patient month growth of and  respectively 
we had the same number of agencies in operation in both periods 
under existing law and regulation  medicare rates will change april  and each january thereafter  based on a statutory formula the intent of which is to cause reimbursement rates to reflect changes in the costs of providing services 
we currently expect the impact of the april  rate change to be insignificant 
our cost of services as a percentage of revenue was higher in than primarily due to the medicare rate cut 
cost of services per patient month decreased slightly less than as higher patient volume offset increases in professional nursing costs 
our decrease in revenue per patient month resulted primarily from the reimbursement changes described above 
adult day health services adhs segment year ended december  and our adhs segment is made up of our adc in center operations and in home personal care operations  both of which predominantly provide long term health care and custodial services that enable patients to avoid nursing home admission

center capacity   average occupancy our adhs revenues increased to million in from million in our mid acquisition of medlink ohio  an in home personal care operation  increased our revenues approximately  adhs revenues excluding the medlink acquisition decreased approximately  due to lower sales volumes in kentucky adult day centers and personal care operations primarily due to kentucky medicaid program cut backs  decreased approximately  due to the closure of certain adult day centers and one personal care operation  and increased approximately  primarily due to higher sales volumes in the non kentucky operations 
average revenue per day of care declined slightly due primarily to mix changes 
occupancy in the adult day care centers was of capacity in as compared to in our cost of services and general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenues was essentially unchanged 
depreciation and amortization increased due to the addition of new guest transportation vans and investments in information technology 
in the year ending december we closed adult day care centers located in frankfort ky  evansville in  and lanham md

a medicare rate decrease of approximately went into effect october  as a result  our revenues for the year ended december  were approximately  lower than they would have been if the rate cut had not been enacted 
our acquisition of medlink oh accounted for approximately million of the revenue growth between periods with the balance of adhs revenue growth coming primarily from our adult day care adc in center volume growth 
our operating income before unallocated corporate expense decreased from the same period last year primarily as a result of increased insurance costs and increased labor costs in both segments 
we also incurred additional costs as a result of increased staffing for training  auditing  information systems and compliance programs 
the medlink acquisition added approximately  to our pre tax income in the year ended december  unallocated corporate expenses in included approximately  consisting primarily of professional fees  related to the cost of conducting our investigation into the restatement of our financial statements as disclosed in our form k for the nine months ended december  it is possible that additional costs related to the investigation may be incurred in future periods

we incurred increased general and administrative and depreciation costs due to increased staffing  and our continued investment in information systems 
we generated more admissions in than in while our patient months of care increased about due to a shorter average length of stay 
as a result  of the medicare rate decrease of approximately which went into effect october   our revenues for the year ended december  were approximately  lower than they would have been if the rate cut had not been enacted

effective july   the commonwealth of kentucky changed its reimbursement program for in home personal care services non skilled 
prior to july   the services had been reimbursed on a cost based system 
from july  forward  services provided are reimbursed on a fee per unit of service basis at a rate lower than the historical reimbursement rates 
we have implemented changes to our operations designed to reduce operating costs 
as a result of the net effect of these reimbursement and cost changes  our adhs segment operating income for the year ended december  was approximately  lower than it would have been if such changes had not taken place 
liquidity and capital resources revolving credit facility 
in march  we renewed our million credit facility with bank one kentucky na 
the renewed facility expires june  the credit facility bears interest at the bank s prime rate adjusted for a margin ranging from to  currently dependent upon total leverage and is secured by substantially all assets and the stock of our subsidiaries 
the weighted average interest rates in effect under the preceding facility were  and for the year ended december   the year ended december  and the nine months ended december   respectively

we will pay a commitment fee of per annum on the unused facility balance on the preceding facility 
borrowings under both the preceding and the new facility are available equal to the greater of a a multiple of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization as defined or b an asset based formula  primarily based on accounts receivable 
borrowings under the facility may be used for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  development and growth of the business and other corporate purposes 
as of december  the formula permitted approximately million to be used  of which approximately million was outstanding 
additionally  an irrevocable letter of credit totaling million  was outstanding in connection with our self insurance programs 
thus  a total of million was either outstanding or committed as of december  while an additional million was available for use 
our revolving credit facility is subject to various financial covenants 
as of december   we were in compliance with the covenants 
under the most restrictive of our covenants  we are required to maintain minimum net worth of at least  we believe that this facility will be sufficient to fund our operating needs for at least the next year 
we will continue to evaluate additional capital  including possible debt and equity investments in us  to support a more rapid development of the business than would be possible with internal funds 
stock and warrant redemption 
in march  we redeemed  shares of common stock and a warrant to purchase  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
our cost of redemption totaled approximately million 
on august   we redeemed  shares of our common stock from a private investor at a total cost of approximately million 
on going stock buy back program 
in march  following the stock and warrant redemption discussed above  our board of directors authorized up to an additional million to be used to acquire shares of our common stock 
in april  we initiated a stock repurchase plan in compliance with rule b of the securities exchange act of this plan permits purchases to take place selectively from time to time in open market purchases through a broker or in privately negotiated transactions 
during the nine months ending december  a total of  shares were repurchased under this program  a total of  was expended for an average acquisition cost of 
during the year ended december  a total of  shares were repurchased for a total of  and an average acquisition cost of per share 
during the year ended december   a total of  shares were repurchased under this program  all of which were in open market purchases 
a total of  was expended on these purchases for an average acquisition cost of per share 
cash flows key elements to the consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended december  and december  and nine months ended december  were net change in cash and cash equivalents year ended year december  year ended nine months ended december  december  provided by used in operating activities    investing activities    financing activities    net decrease in cash and cash equivalents    year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities resulted principally from our current period income  net of changes in accounts receivable  accounts payable and accrued expenses 
substantially all the decrease in accounts receivable resulted from medicare cost report settlements 
days sales outstanding were approximately and at december  and  respectively 
the decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities resulted primarily from a lower liability under our self insured employee health program 
this lower liability resulted from a an intentional acceleration of the claims payment process and b lower employee participation due to an increase in required employee contributions 
the decrease in other assets and liabilities is principally the result of the discontinuation and payout of the deferred compensation plan 
net cash used in investing activities resulted principally from improvements in our information systems and a cash bond of million posted in a litigation appeal  partially offset by cash received from sale of assets 
net cash used in financing activities resulted primarily from repayments on our credit facility and payment of capital lease and debt obligations 
year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities resulted principally from our current period income  net of changes in accounts receivable  accounts payable and accrued expenses 
substantially all the increase in accounts receivable resulted from revenue growth 
days sales outstanding were approximately and at december  and  respectively 
the decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities resulted primarily from a lower liability under our self insured employee health program 
this lower liability resulted from a an intentional acceleration of the claims payment process and b lower employee participation due to an increase in required employee contributions 
net cash used in investing activities resulted principally from amounts invested in the acquisition of medlink ohio  improvements in information systems and adult day health services expansion activities 
net cash used by financing activities resulted primarily from borrowings on our credit facility offset by payment of capital lease and debt obligations and repurchases of our common stock  net of proceeds from stock option exercises 
nine months ended december  net cash provided by operating activities resulted principally from our current period income  net of changes in accounts receivable  accounts payable and accrued expenses 
substantially all the increase in accounts receivable resulted from revenue growth 
days sales outstanding were approximately at both december  and march  substantially all the decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities resulted from the reversal of the remainder of accounting reserves originally recorded at the time discontinued operations accounting treatment was adopted for the visiting nurse segment which is included in the income from discontinued operations 
net cash used in investing activities resulted principally from amounts invested in adult day health services expansion activities and improvements in information systems 
net cash used by financing activities resulted primarily from borrowings on our credit facility  payment of capital lease and debt obligations  repurchases of our common stock  and proceeds from stock option exercises 
contractual obligations 
the following table provides information about the payment dates of our contractual obligations at december   excluding current liabilities except for the current portion of long term debt amounts in thousands thereafter total revolving credit facility   capital lease obligations  notes payable operating leases        total        we believe that a certain amount of debt has an appropriate place in our overall capital structure and it is not our strategy to eliminate all debt financing 
we believe that our cash flow from operations  and borrowing capacity on our bank credit facility will be sufficient to cover operating needs  future capital expenditure requirements and scheduled debt payments of miscellaneous small borrowing arrangements and capitalized leases 
in addition  it is likely that we will pursue growth from acquisitions  partnerships and other ventures that would be funded from excess cash from operations  credit available under the bank credit agreement and other financing arrangements that are normally available in the marketplace 
commitments and contingencies letter of credit 
we have an outstanding letter of credit of million at december   which benefits our third party insurer administrator for our automobile and workers compensation self insurance programs 
the amount of such insurance program letter of credit is subject to negotiation annually upon renewal and may vary in the future based upon such negotiation  our historical claims experience and expected future claims 
it is reasonable to expect that the amount of the letter of credit will increase in the future  however  we are unable to predict to what degree 
acquisition agreements 
we currently have no obligations related to acquisition agreements 
however  we periodically seek acquisition candidates and may reasonably be expected to enter into acquisitions in the future 
general and professional liability 
malpractice and general patient liability claims for incidents which may give rise to litigation have been asserted against us by various claimants 
the claims are in various stages of processing and some may ultimately be brought to trial 
we also know of incidents that have occurred through december  that may result in the assertion of additional claims 
we carry insurance coverage for this exposure  however our deductible per claim increased from  to  effective july  and to  effective april  we record estimated liabilities for our insurance programs based on information provided by the third party plan administrators  historical claims experience  the life cycle of claims  expected costs of claims incurred but not paid  and expected costs to settle unpaid claims 
we monitor our estimated insurance related liabilities on a quarterly basis 
as facts change  it may become necessary to make adjustments that could be material to our results of operations and financial condition 
other litigation 
franklin litigation on january  franklin capital associates lp franklin  aetna life and casualty company and aetna casualty and surety company shareholders  who at one time held approximately  shares of our common stock approximately of shares outstanding  filed suit in chancery court of williamson county  tennessee claiming unspecified damages not to exceed three million dollars in connection with registration rights they received in our acquisition of certain home health operations in february the suit alleged that we failed to use our best efforts to register the shares held by the plaintiffs as required by the merger agreement 
we settled with both aetna parties shortly before the case went to trial in february in mid trial franklin voluntarily withdrew its complaint reserving its legal rights to bring a new suit as allowed under tennessee law 
in april  franklin re filed its lawsuit 
the second trial took place in february in april the court issued a ruling in favor of the plaintiffs awarding damages of  we believe the court erred both in its finding of liability and in its determination of the amount of damages 
we are seeking appellate review of the lower court decision 
as a part of the appeal  we were required to post cash of  in an escrow account with the tennessee courts in lieu of a supersedeas appeal bond until the appeal court issues a review order 
this cash is reflected as cash held in escrow in the accompanying balance sheet and will remain in escrow until the matter reaches its ultimate resolution 
based on the advice of our legal counsel  we believe that the damage award by the lower court does not create a probable loss as set forth in statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies 
accordingly  no provision for the damages award has been recorded in the accompanying financial statements 
should the facts and circumstances change in the future to the extent that such a loss appears probable  we would record a provision at that time 
based on the advice of our legal counsel  we believe we have strong grounds for appealing the trial court s decision and we intend to vigorously pursue our appeal 
we can give no assurance that we will be successful in our appeal 
kentucky transportation litigation prior to july   the commonwealth of kentucky managed its medicaid transportation program internally 
effective july  the commonwealth contracted with an independent broker the broker for the management of the program in the louisville ky area 
the broker then contracted with us  among others  for the provision of transportation services to medicaid beneficiaries 
our services pursuant to the contract were limited to transportation of medicaid beneficiaries who also attended our in center adult day care programs 
the broker almost immediately began to encounter significant financial difficulties and paid us for only a small portion of the amounts due for services rendered 
on october   three of the broker s other contracted providers filed a motion with the us bankruptcy court to liquidate the broker under chapter of the federal bankruptcy code 
on november   the broker voluntarily chose to convert their bankruptcy status to a chapter  voluntary reorganization 
in may  along with a group of other affected providers  we filed suit against the commonwealth in franklin circuit court seeking payment directly from the commonwealth 
the commonwealth objected to the lawsuit on the basis of sovereign immunity and filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit 
in july  a hearing on the motion to dismiss was held and at the judge s request written briefs were filed before the judge would make a decision 
in august  the motion to dismiss was granted and after discussion with legal counsel  an appeal of this decision was made to the kentucky court of appeals 
as of december  and december   the broker owed us approximately  which amount is included in accounts receivable  net on the accompanying balance sheets 
although we currently believe we will be successful in ultimately collecting the amounts currently due us under this arrangement  there can be no assurance that such amounts will in fact be collected 
should it become evident in the future that a material amount will not be collectible  we will  at that time  record an additional provision for uncollectible accounts 
our loan agreement executed with our lender in march provides that the loss of either or both of the above litigation cases will be excluded from our financial results for purposes of calculating borrowing availability or financial covenant compliance 
medicaid dependence we have a significant dependence on state medicaid reimbursement programs 
for the year ended december   approximately      and of our revenues were generated from medicaid reimbursement programs in the states of maryland  ohio  kentucky  connecticut  florida  massachusetts and indiana  respectively 
approximately of our revenues are from state medicaid and other government programs  virtually all of which are currently facing significant budget issues 
the medicaid programs in each of the states in which we operate are taking actions or evaluating taking actions to reduce medicaid expenditures 
among these actions are the following o redefining eligibility standards for medicaid coverage o redefining coverage criteria for home and community based care services o slowing payments to providers by increasing the minimum time in which payments are made o limiting reimbursement rate increases o changing regulations under which providers must operate the actions being taken and or being considered are in response to declines in state tax revenues due to the slowing of the us economy 
we believe that these financial issues are cyclical in nature rather than indicative of the long term prospect for medicaid funding of health care services 
it is possible however  that the actions taken by the state medicaid programs in the future could have a significant unfavorable impact on our results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
health care reform the health care industry has experienced  and is expected to continue to experience  extensive and dynamic change 
in addition to economic forces and regulatory influences  continuing political debate is subjecting the health care industry to significant reform 
health care reforms have been enacted as discussed elsewhere in this document 
proposals for additional changes are continuously formulated by departments of the federal government  congress  and state legislatures 
government officials can be expected to continue to review and assess alternative health care delivery systems and payment methodologies 
changes in the law or new interpretations of existing laws may have a dramatic effect on the definition of permissible or impermissible activities  the relative cost of doing business  and the methods and amounts of payments for medical care by both governmental and other payors 
legislative changes to balance the budget and slow the annual rate of growth of expenditures are expected to continue 
such future changes may further impact our reimbursement 
there can be no assurance that future legislation or regulatory changes will not have a material adverse effect on our operations 
federal and state legislative proposals continue to be introduced that would impose more limitations on payments to providers of health care services such as us 
many states have enacted  or are considering enacting  measures that are designed to reduce their medicaid expenditures 
we cannot predict what additional government regulations may be enacted in the future affecting our business or how existing or future laws and regulations might be interpreted  or whether we will be able to comply with such laws and regulations in our existing or future markets 
refer to the sections on reimbursement changes and cautionary statements forward outlook and risks in part i  and the notes to the consolidated financial statements and elsewhere in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for additional information 
health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa the health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa was enacted by the federal government on august   and requires organizations to adhere to certain standards to protect data integrity  confidentiality and availability 
hipaa also mandates  among other things  that the department of health and human services adopt standards for the exchange of electronic health information in an effort to encourage overall administrative simplification and enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of the health care industry 
we implemented changes in our operations to comply with the privacy aspects of hipaa and we believe we are in compliance 
the cost of complying with privacy standards is not expected to have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position 
we are in the process of implementing changes in our operations to comply with the electronic transaction and code sets aspects of hipaa and we anticipate that we will be able to fully and timely comply with those requirements 
independent of hipaa requirements  we have been developing new information systems with improved functionality to facilitate improved billing and collection activities  reduced administrative costs and improved decision support information 
we have incorporated the hipaa mandated electronic transaction and code sets into the design of this new software 
regulations with regard to the security components of hipaa  have only recently been published 
those regulations are required to be implemented by april we cannot at this time estimate the cost of compliance with the security regulations 
discontinued operations during the year ended december   we recorded in income from discontinued operations a one time reduction in estimated tax liabilities of approximately  or per diluted share  due to the expiration of various statutory limitations pertaining to the tax year in which we sold our product operations 
impact of inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on income during the past several years 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk derivative instruments we do not use derivative instruments 
market risk of financial instruments our primary market risk exposure with regard to financial instruments is to changes in interest rates 
at december   a hypothetical basis point increase in short term interest rates would result in a reduction of approximately  in annual pre tax earnings
