item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations company strategy for a further discussion 
electric operations og e general the electric utility segment generates  transmits  distributes and sells electric energy in oklahoma and western arkansas 
its operations are conducted through og e 
og e furnishes retail electric service in communities and their contiguous rural and suburban areas 
during  five other communities and three rural electric cooperatives in oklahoma and western arkansas purchased electricity from og e for resale 
the service area  with an estimated population of million  covers approximately  square miles in oklahoma and western arkansas  including oklahoma city  the largest city in oklahoma  and fort smith  arkansas 
of the communities served  are located in oklahoma and in arkansas 
approximately percent of total electric operating revenues for the year ended december   were derived from sales in oklahoma and the remainder from sales in arkansas 
og e s system control area peak demand as reported by the system dispatcher during was approximately  mws on august  og e s load responsibility peak demand was approximately  mws on august   resulting in a capacity margin of approximately percent 
as reflected in the table below and in the operating statistics on page  there were approximately million megawatt hour mwh sales in as compared to approximately million in and mwh sales to og e s customers system sales increased approximately percent in  due to increased usage related to customer growth in og e s service territory partially offset by milder weather during sales to other utilities and power marketers off system sales decreased approximately percent in  due to the changing supply and demand needs on og e s generation system 
variations in mwh sales for the three years are reflected in the following table increase decrease increase decrease increase decrease system sales a off system sales a total sales a sales are in million of mwhs 
og e is subject to competition in various degrees from government owned electric systems  municipally owned electric systems  rural electric cooperatives and  in certain respects  from other private utilities  power marketers and cogenerators 
oklahoma law forbids the granting of an exclusive franchise to a utility for providing electricity 
besides competition from other suppliers or marketers of electricity  og e competes with suppliers of other forms of energy 
the degree of competition between suppliers may vary depending on relative costs and supplies of other forms of energy 
see regulation and rates state restructuring initiatives and national energy legislation for a discussion of the potential impact on competition from federal and state legislation

the issuance of certain securities by og e is also regulated by the occ and the apsc 
og e s wholesale electric tariffs  short term borrowing authorization and accounting practices are subject to the jurisdiction of the ferc 
the secretary of the department of energy has jurisdiction over some of og e s facilities and operations 
for the year ended december   approximately percent of og e s electric revenue was subject to the jurisdiction of the occ  nine percent to the apsc and four percent to the ferc 
the order of the occ authorizing og e to reorganize into a subsidiary of the company contains certain provisions which  among other things  ensure the occ access to the books and records of the company and its affiliates relating to transactions with og e  require the company to employ accounting and other procedures and controls to protect against subsidization of non utility activities by og e s customers  and prohibit the company from pledging og e assets or income for affiliate transactions 
settlement agreement on october   og e  the occ staff  the oklahoma attorney general and other interested parties agreed to the settlement agreement of og e s rate case 
the administrative law judge subsequently recommended approval of the settlement agreement and on november   the occ signed a rate order containing the provisions of the settlement agreement 
the settlement agreement provides for  among other items i a million annual reduction in the electric rates of og e s oklahoma customers which went into effect january   ii recovery by og e  through rate base  of the capital expenditures associated with the january ice storm  iii og e to acquire electric generation new generation of not less than megawatts mw to be integrated into og e s generation system  and iv recovery by og e  over three years  of the million in deferred operating costs  associated with the january ice storm  through og e s rider for off system sales 
previously  og e had a sharing mechanism in oklahoma for any off system sales 
the settlement agreement provided that the first million in annual net profits from og e s off system sales will go to og e  the next million in annual net profits from off system sales will go to og e s oklahoma customers  and any net profits of off system sales in excess of these amounts will be credited in each sales year with percent to og e s oklahoma customers and the remaining percent to og e 
if any of the million is not recovered at the end of the three years  the occ will authorize the recovery of any remaining costs 
pending acquisition of power plant as part of the settlement agreement with the occ  og e undertook to acquire new generation of not less than mws 
the acquisition of a percent interest in the mw nrg mcclain station the mcclain plant would clearly constitute an acquisition of such new generation under the settlement agreement 
og e expects this new generation  including the interim purchase power agreement  will provide savings  over a three year period  in excess of million to its oklahoma customers 
these savings will be derived from i the avoidance of purchase power contracts otherwise needed  ii replacing an above market cogeneration contract with powersmith cogeneration project  lp powersmith when it can be terminated at the end of august  and iii fuel savings associated with operating efficiencies of the new plant 
these savings  while providing real savings to oklahoma customers  are not expected to affect the profitability of og e because og e s rates would not need to be reduced to accomplish these savings 
as indicated in the settlement agreement  og e is required to provide monthly reports  for a period of months after the acquisition  to the occ staff  documenting and providing proof of savings experienced by og e s customers 
in the event og e is unable to demonstrate at least million in savings to its customers during this month period  og e will have an obligation to credit its oklahoma customers any unrealized savings below million as determined at the end of the month period  which shall be no later than december  powersmith has filed an application with the occ seeking to compel og e to continue purchasing power from powersmith s qualified cogeneration facility under the public utility regulatory policy act of purpa at a price that would include an avoided capacity charge equal to the lesser of i the rate currently specified in the power purchase agreement between og e and powersmith or ii the avoided cost of the mcclain plant 
og e does not believe that this matter should be heard at the occ at this time and that the avoided cost requested by powersmith is too high 
in the event powersmith is ultimately successful and og e is required to sign a purchase power agreement  it could negatively affect og e s ability to achieve the targeted million three year customer savings under the existing terms of the settlement agreement 
powersmith and og e have been holding discussions to determine if mutually agreeable terms can be reached for a power contract between the companies providing for capacity payments to the powersmith facility 
in the event og e did not acquire the new generation by december   the settlement agreement requires og e to credit million annually at a rate of of million per month for each month that the new generation is not in place to its oklahoma customers beginning january  and continuing through december  however  if og e purchases the new generation subsequent to january   the credit to oklahoma customers will terminate in the first month that the new generation begins initial operations and any previously credited amounts to oklahoma customers will be deducted in the determination of the million targeted savings 
on august   og e signed an asset purchase agreement to acquire nrg mcclain llc s percent interest in the mcclain plant 
the acquisition of this interest in the mcclain plant would clearly constitute an acquisition of new generation under the settlement agreement 
the purchase price for the interest in the mcclain plant is approximately million  subject to adjustment for prepaid gas and property taxes 
the mcclain plant includes natural gas fired combined cycle combustion turbine units and is located near newcastle  oklahoma in mcclain county  oklahoma 
the mcclain plant began operating in the owner of the remaining percent in the mcclain plant is the oklahoma municipal power authority ompa 
closing is subject to customary conditions including receipt of regulatory approval by the ferc 
the asset purchase agreement  as amended  provides that  unless extended  either party has the right to terminate the contract if the closing does not occur on or before march  because the current owner of the mcclain plant has filed for bankruptcy protection  the acquisition also was subject to approval by the bankruptcy court 
as part of the bankruptcy approval process  nrg mcclain llc s interest in the plant was subject to an auction process and on october   the bankruptcy court approved the sale of nrg mcclain llc s interest in the plant to og e 
several parties have filed interventions at the ferc opposing og e s application under section of the federal power act to acquire nrg mcclain s interest in the power plant or  alternatively  requesting the ferc to delay approving such acquisition 
og e believed that its application met the standards under section set forth by the ferc and that its application would be approved 
on december   the ferc shifted its policy regarding market power issues  raised wholesale market power concerns and ordered a hearing regarding og e s acquisition of the mcclain plant 
the ferc action did not reject og e s request to purchase the mcclain plant  but demonstrated that og e must address certain issues 
on january   og e filed a petition for re hearing of the ferc s december  order which included new mitigation measures that were designed to allow for prompt approval of the transaction 
that request is still pending before the ferc 
og e has no indication whether the ferc will accept those proposed mitigation measures 
on march   og e filed testimony and exhibits with the ferc administrative law judge 
the testimony and exhibits indicate that  if the case proceeds to hearing  the wholesale market power issues that the ferc raised in the december  order may be resolved by the minimal mitigation measures 
assuming the acquisition occurs  og e expects to operate the plant in accordance with a joint ownership and operating agreement with the ompa 
under this agreement  og e would operate the facility  and og e and the ompa would be entitled to the net available output of the plant based on their respective ownership percentages 
all fixed and variable costs  except fuel and gas transportation costs  would be shared in proportion to the respective ownership interests 
fuel and gas transportation costs would be shared based on consumption 
og e expects to utilize its portion of the output  mws  to serve its native load 
as provided in the settlement agreement pending approval of a request to increase base rates to recover the investment in the plant  og e will have the right to accrue a regulatory asset  for a period not to exceed months subsequent to the acquisition  consisting of the non fuel operation and maintenance expenses  depreciation  cost of debt associated with the investment and ad valorem taxes 
upon approval by the occ of og e s request  all prudently incurred costs accrued through the regulatory asset within the month period will be included in og e s prospective cost of service 
despite the delay at the ferc  an agreement to purchase power from the mcclain plant is enabling og e to honor the customer savings as outlined in the settlement agreement 
on january   og e filed an application with the occ and requested that the occ confirm the steps that og e has taken to comply with the settlement agreement will result in customer savings being delivered beginning january   and that no further rate reduction is necessary 
various parties have intervened opposing og e s request 
if the occ does not agree with og e s request  og e will be required to reduce electric rates to its oklahoma customers by approximately million per month and would expect to reduce expenditures for planned electric system reliability upgrades 
the occ has scheduled a hearing on april  for action in this case 
assuming that og e acquires the mcclain plant  og e expects to fund the acquisition with a combination of a capital contribution from the company  funded in part by the company s equity issuance in  and the issuance of long term debt by og e 
rate case on september   og e filed with the occ a notice of intent to seek an annual increase in its rates to its oklahoma customers of more than one percent 
the notice listed the following  among others  as major issues to be addressed in its application i the acquisition of new generation in accordance with the settlement agreement  ii increased capital expenditures for efficiency improvements and reliability enhancements to ensure fuel costs are minimized  and iii increased pension  medical and insurance costs 
on october   og e filed a request with the occ to increase its rates by approximately million annually 
the increase was intended to pay for its pending acquisition of a percent interest in the mcclain plant  allow for investment in electric system reliability and address rising business costs 
the rate plan would have reduced rates for schools and more than  small businesses and non profit organizations 
on january   og e filed an application to withdraw its request for a million rate increase due to the delay at ferc in receiving the necessary approvals to complete the acquisition of the mcclain plant  which was a significant part of this rate case 
an order dismissing the case was issued by the occ on january  on december   the ferc issued an order setting for hearing og e s proposed acquisition of the mcclain plant and on january   the ferc administrative law judge in charge of the hearing and the parties to the case agreed to a procedural schedule that would produce a decision on the mcclain plant acquisition no sooner than the third quarter of og e expects to file another rate case in the near future to recover increased operating and capital expenditures 
gas transportation and storage agreement as part of the settlement agreement  og e also agreed to consider competitive bidding for gas transportation service to its natural gas fired generation facilities pursuant to the terms set forth in the settlement agreement 
og e believes that in order for it to achieve maximum coal generation and ensure reliable electric service  it must have firm no notice load following service for both gas transportation and gas storage 
this type of service is required to satisfy the daily swings in customer demand placed on og e s system and still permit natural gas units to not impede coal energy production 
og e also believes that gas storage is an integral part of providing gas supply to og e s generation facilities 
accordingly  og e evaluated its competitive bid options in light of these circumstances 
og e s evaluation clearly demonstrates that the enogex integrated gas system provides superior firm no notice load following service to og e that is not available from other companies serving the og e marketplace 
on april   og e filed an application with the occ in which og e advised the occ that  after careful consideration  competitive bidding for gas transportation was rejected in favor of a new intrastate firm no notice load following gas transportation and storage services agreement with enogex 
this seven year agreement provides for gas transportation and storage services for each of og e s natural gas fired generation facilities 
during  og e paid enogex approximately million for gas transportation and storage services 
based upon requests for information from intervenors  og e has requested from enogex and enogex has agreed to retain a cost of service consultant to assist in the preparation of testimony related to this case 
on january   the occ issued a procedural schedule for this case 
a hearing is scheduled august  and an occ order in the case is expected by the end of og e believes the amount currently paid to enogex for no notice load following transportation and storage services is fair  just and reasonable 
if any amounts paid by og e are found not to be recoverable  og e believes such amount would not be material 
security enhancements on april   og e filed a joint application with the occ requesting approval for security investments and a rider to recover these costs from the ratepayers 
on august   og e filed testimony with the occ outlining proposed expenditures and related actions for security enhancement and a proposed recovery rider 
attempting to make security investments at the proper level  og e has developed a set of guidelines intended to minimize long term or widespread outages  minimize the impact on critical national defense and related customers  maximize the ability to respond to and recover from an attack  minimize the financial impact on og e that might be caused by an attack and accomplish these efforts with minimal impact on ratepayers 
the occ staff retained a security expert to review the report filed by og e 
og e currently expects that hearings will be held in early on october   the occ filed a notice of inquiry to consider the issues related to the role of the occ and oklahoma regulated companies in addressing the security of the electrical system infrastructure and key assets 
on march   the occ deliberated the notice of inquiry and directed the occ staff to file a rulemaking proceeding for each utility industry regarding security of the electrical system infrastructure and key assets 
other regulatory actions the settlement agreement  when it became effective  provided for the termination of the acquisition premium credit rider apc rider and the gas transportation adjustment credit rider gtac rider 
the apc rider was approved by the occ in march and was implemented by og e to reflect the completion of the recovery of the amortization premium paid by og e when it acquired enogex in the effect of the apc rider was to remove approximately million annually from the amount being recovered by og e from its oklahoma customers in current rates 
in june  the occ approved a stipulation the stipulation to the competitive bid process of og e s gas transportation service from enogex 
the stipulation directed og e to reduce its rates to its oklahoma retail customers by approximately million per year through the implementation of the gtac rider 
the gtac rider was a credit for gas transportation cost recovery and was applicable to and became part of each oklahoma retail rate schedule to which og e s automatic fuel adjustment clause applies 
as discussed above  the settlement agreement terminated the gtac rider 
consequently  these charges for gas transportation provided by enogex are now included in base rates 
og e s generation efficiency performance rider gep rider expired in june the gep rider was established initially in in connection with og e s general rate review and was intended to encourage og e to lower its fuel costs by i allowing og e to collect one third of the amount by which its fuel costs were below a specified percentage percent of the average fuel costs of certain other investor owned utilities in the region  and ii disallowing the collection of one third of the amount by which its fuel costs exceeded a specified percentage percent of the average fuel costs of other investor owned utilities 
in june the occ made modifications to the gep rider which had the effect of reducing the amount og e could recover under the gep rider by i changing og e s peer group to include utilities with a higher coal to gas generation mix  ii reducing the amount of fuel costs that can be recovered if og e s costs exceed the new peer group by changing the percentage above which og e will not be allowed to recover one third of the fuel costs from oklahoma customers from percent to percent  iii reducing og e s share of cost savings as compared to its new peer group from percent to percent  and iv limiting to million the amount of any awards paid to og e or penalties charged to og e 
for the period between january  and june   og e recovered approximately million under the gep rider 
state restructuring initiatives oklahoma as previously reported  the electric restructuring act of the act was initially designed to provide retail customers in oklahoma a choice of their electric supplier by july  additional implementing legislation was to be adopted by the oklahoma legislature to address many specific issues associated with the act and with deregulation 
in may  a bill addressing the specific issues of deregulation was passed in the oklahoma state senate and then was defeated in the oklahoma house of representatives 
in may  the oklahoma legislature postponed the scheduled start date for customer choice from july  until at least in addition to postponing the date for customer choice  this legislation called for a nine member task force to further study the issues surrounding deregulation 
the task force includes the governor or his designee  the oklahoma attorney general  the occ chair and several legislative leaders  among others 
in the legislative session  additional legislation was introduced to repeal the act  but the legislative session ended without any further action to repeal the act 
it is unknown at this time whether the act will be repealed 
the company will continue to actively participate in the legislative process and expects to remain a competitive supplier of electricity 
as a result of the failures of california s attempt to deregulate its electricity markets  the enron bankruptcy  and associated impacts on the industry  efforts to restructure the electricity market in oklahoma appear at this time to be delayed indefinitely 
arkansas in april  arkansas passed a law the restructuring law calling for restructuring of the electric utility industry at the retail level 
the restructuring law initially targeted customer choice of electricity providers by january  in february  the restructuring law was amended to delay the start date of customer choice of electric providers in arkansas until october   with the apsc having discretion to further delay implementation to october  in march  the restructuring law was repealed 
as part of the repeal legislation  electric public utilities are permitted to recover transition costs 
og e incurred approximately million in transition costs necessary to carry out its responsibilities associated with efforts to implement retail open access 
on january   the apsc issued an order which authorized og e to recover approximately million in transition costs over an month period beginning february automatic fuel adjustment clauses variances in the actual cost of fuel used in electric generation and certain purchased power costs  as compared to the fuel component in the cost of service for ratemaking  are passed through to og e s customers through automatic fuel adjustment clauses  which are subject to periodic review by the occ  the apsc and the ferc 
the occ is currently reviewing the appropriateness of gas transportation charges under the agreement between og e and enogex 
see gas transportation and storage agreement for a further discussion 
og e believes the amount currently paid to enogex for transportation and storage services is fair  just and reasonable 
all of the storage costs and a portion of the gas transportation costs are included in either base rates or are recoverable through og e s automatic fuel adjustment clause 
see regulation and rates other regulatory actions for a further discussion 
national energy legislation in december the us senate failed to pass a comprehensive energy bill that had long been debated in the senate and the house of representatives 
the bill  as it was proposed  would have been largely beneficial to the company 
it contained provisions that would have minimized the risk of future uneconomic purchased power contracts being forced on the company under the purpa as well as providing tax incentives for investment in the electric transmission and natural gas pipeline systems 
the bill also provided favorable provisions for mandatory reliability oversight by the north american electric reliability council with oversight by the ferc as well as the ferc citing authority for electric transmission in disputed areas 
also positive to the company was that the bill did not contain any provisions for mandatory levels of renewable energy which would have had the effect of raising the company s electric rates 
another significant provision of the energy bill was the repeal of the public utility holding company act of which was of minimal impact to the company 
when congress reconvened in january  the debate renewed over the energy bill 
a compromise bill has been proposed in the senate that would keep all of the issues important to the company intact with the exception of the tax provisions 
excluding those provisions would eliminate the incentives for investment in the electric transmission and natural gas pipeline systems 
it is unknown at this time what language will be contained in the final bill or when  or if  the bill is likely to be considered again in the senate and the house of representatives and  when or if  the bill ultimately will be approved 
federal law imposes numerous responsibilities and requirements on og e 
purpa requires electric utilities  such as og e  to purchase power generated in a manufacturing process from a qualified cogeneration facility qf 
generally stated  electric utilities must purchase electric energy and production capacity made available by qf s at a rate reflecting the cost that the purchasing utility can avoid as a result of obtaining energy and production capacity from these sources  rather than generating an equivalent amount of energy itself or purchasing the energy or capacity from other suppliers 
og e has entered into agreements with four such cogenerators 
electric utilities also must furnish electric energy to qf s on a non discriminatory basis at a rate that is just  reasonable and in the public interest and must provide certain types of service which may be requested by qf s to supplement or back up those facilities own generation 
although efforts to increase competition at the state level have been stalled  there have been several initiatives implemented at the federal level to increase competition in the wholesale markets for electricity 
the national energy policy act of energy act  among other things  promoted the development of independent power producers ipp 
the energy act was followed by ferc order and order  which facilitated third party utilization of the transmission grid for sales of wholesale power 
the energy act  orders and  and other ferc policies and initiatives have significantly increased competition in the wholesale power market 
utilities  including og e  have increased their own in house wholesale marketing efforts and the number of entities with whom they historically traded 
moreover  power marketers became an increasingly important presence in the industry  however  their importance has declined following the bankruptcy of enron and the financial troubles of other significant power marketers 
these entities typically arbitrage wholesale price differentials by buying power produced by others in one market and selling it in another 
ipp s also are becoming a more significant sector of the electric utility industry 
in both oklahoma and arkansas  significant additions of new power plants have been announced and  in some cases completed  almost all of it from ipp s 
notwithstanding these developments in the wholesale power market  the ferc recognized that impediments remained to the achievement of fully competitive wholesale markets including i engineering and economic inefficiencies inherent in the current operation and expansion of the transmission grid  and ii continuing opportunities for transmission owners primarily electric utilities to discriminate in the operation of their transmission facilities in favor of their own or affiliated power marketing activities 
in the past  the ferc only encouraged utilities to join and place their transmission systems under the operational control of independent system operators iso 
on december   the ferc issued order  its final rule on regional transmission organizations rto 
order is intended to have the effect of turning the nation s transmission facilities into independently operated common carriers that offer comparable service to all would be users 
although adopting a voluntary approach towards rto formation  the ferc stressed that order does not preclude it from requiring rto participation 
order set out a timetable for every jurisdictional utility including og e to either join in an rto filing  or  alternatively  to submit a filing describing its efforts to join an rto  the reasons for not participating in an rto proposal and any obstacles to participation  and its plans for further work toward participation 
og e is a member of the southwest power pool spp  the regional reliability organization for all or parts of oklahoma  arkansas  kansas  louisiana  new mexico  mississippi  missouri and texas 
og e participated with the spp in the development of regional transmission tariffs and executed an agency agreement with the spp to facilitate interstate transmission operations within this region in in october  the spp filed its application with the ferc to become an rto 
in july  the ferc determined that the spp did not have adequate scope and configuration to be granted rto status 
the spp was encouraged to explore the possibility of joining an rto to be formed in the southeastern region of the united states and then to explore the feasibility of becoming a part of the recently approved rto being established by the midwest independent system operator miso 
the spp and miso entered negotiations during the late summer of to combine the spp and miso and to form a new regional transmission entity that would combine the miso and spp organizations  capture certain synergies that would be available from the combined organization  and allow member companies in the spp certain options with respect to membership in the combined organization 
however  for a variety of reasons  miso and spp terminated their proposed combination in march og e remained a member of the spp while the miso spp combination was pending  and og e participated with the spp and other spp members to evaluate the next steps necessary for compliance with the ferc s order in the meantime  the spp continued to offer open access transmission service in the spp region under the spp open access transmission tariff 
on october   the spp filed an application with the ferc seeking authority to form an rto 
on february   the ferc conditionally approved the spp s application 
the spp must meet certain conditions before it may commence operations as an rto 
termination of the proposed miso spp combination and recent conditional approval of the spp rto application are not expected to significantly impact the company s consolidated financial results 
in october  the ferc issued a notice of proposed rulemaking proposing to adopt new standards of conduct rules applicable to all jurisdictional electric and natural gas transmission providers 
the proposed rules would replace the current rules governing the electric transmission and wholesale electric functions of electric utilities and the rules governing natural gas transportation and wholesale gas supply functions 
the proposed rules would expand the definition of affiliate and further limit communications between transmission functions and supply functions  and could materially increase operating costs of market participants  including og e and enogex 
in april  the ferc staff issued a reaction paper  generally rejecting the comments of parties opposed to the proposed rules 
on november   the ferc issued its new rules regulating the relationship between electric and gas transmission providers and those entities merchant personnel and energy affiliates 
the ferc s final rule requires all transmission providers to be in full compliance with the new rules by june  in february  og e and enogex submitted plans and schedules to take the necessary actions to be in compliance with these new rules and expect that their initial costs to comply with the final rule will not exceed million in the final rule is currently before the ferc on rehearing 
any changes to the final rule on rehearing could affect the anticipated compliance costs 
in july  the ferc issued a notice of proposed rulemaking on standard market design rulemaking for regulated utilities 
if implemented as proposed  the rulemaking will substantially change how wholesale electric markets operate throughout the united states 
the proposed rulemaking expands the ferc s intent to unbundle transmission operations from integrated utilities and ensure robust competition in wholesale markets 
the proposed rule contemplates that all wholesale and retail customers will take transmission service under a single network transmission service tariff 
the rule also contemplates the implementation of a bid based system for buying and selling energy in wholesale markets 
rtos or independent transmission providers will administer the market 
rtos will also be responsible for regional plans that identify opportunities to construct new transmission  generation or demand side programs to reduce transmission constraints and meet regional energy requirements 
finally  the rule envisions the development of regional market monitors responsible for ensuring the individual participants do not exercise unlawful market power 
on april   the ferc issued a white paper  wholesale market platform  in which the ferc indicated that it will change the proposed rule as reflected in the white paper and following additional regional technical conferences 
the ferc committed in the white paper to work with interested parties including state commissions to find solutions that will recognize regional differences within regions subject to the ferc s jurisdiction 
thus far  the ferc has held conferences in boston  omaha  wilmington  tallahassee  phoenix  new york and san francisco 
in october  the ferc issued new rules governing corporate money pools  which include jurisdictional public utility or pipeline subsidiaries of nonregulated parent companies 
the rules require documentation of transactions within such money pools and notification to the ferc if the common equity ratio of the utility falls below percent 
the ferc requires all utilities authorized to sell power at market based rates to file updated market power analyses every three years 
in december  og e filed its updated market power analysis with the ferc 
regulatory assets and liabilities og e  as a regulated utility  is subject to the accounting principles prescribed by the financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation 
sfas no 
provides that certain costs that would otherwise be charged to expense can be deferred as regulatory assets  based on the expected recovery from customers in future rates 
likewise  certain credits that would otherwise reduce expense can be deferred as regulatory liabilities  based on the expected flowback to customers in future rates 
management s expected recovery of deferred costs and flowback of deferred credits generally results from specific decisions by regulators granting such ratemaking treatment 
og e initially records certain costs i that are probable of future recovery as a deferred charge until such time as the cost is approved by a regulatory authority  then the cost is reclassified as a regulatory asset  and ii that are probable of future liability as a deferred credit until such time as the amount is approved by a regulatory authority  then the amount is reclassified as a regulatory liability 
at december  and  og e had regulatory assets of approximately million and million  respectively  and regulatory liabilities of approximately million and million  respectively 
approximately percent of the regulatory assets and liabilities are allocated to og e s electric generation assets and approximately percent of the regulatory assets and liabilities are allocated to og e s electric transmission and distribution assets 
as discussed previously  legislation was enacted in oklahoma and arkansas that was to restructure the electric utility industry in those states 
the arkansas legislation was repealed and implementation of the oklahoma restructuring legislation has been delayed and seems unlikely to proceed during the near future 
yet  if and when implemented this legislation would deregulate og e s electric generation assets and cause the company to discontinue the use of sfas no 
 with respect to its related regulatory balances 
this may result in either full recovery of generation related regulatory assets net of related regulatory liabilities or a non cash  pre tax write off as an extraordinary charge  depending on the transition mechanisms developed by the legislature for the recovery of all or a portion of these net regulatory assets 
the previously enacted oklahoma and arkansas legislation would not affect og e s electric transmission and distribution assets and the company believes that the continued use of sfas no 
with respect to the related regulatory balances is appropriate 
however  if utility regulators in oklahoma and arkansas were to adopt regulatory methodologies in the future that are not based on the cost of service  the continued use of sfas no 
with respect to the regulatory balances related to the electric transmission and distribution assets may no longer be appropriate 
based on a current evaluation of the various factors and conditions that are expected to impact future cost recovery  management believes that its regulatory assets  including those related to generation  are probable of future recovery 
summary the energy act  the actions of the ferc  the restructuring legislation in oklahoma and other factors are intended to increase competition in the electric industry 
og e has taken steps in the past and intends to take appropriate steps in the future to remain a competitive supplier of electricity 
while og e is supportive of competition  it believes that all electric suppliers must be required to compete on a fair and equitable basis and og e is advocating this position vigorously 
rate activities and proposals in  og e concluded its oklahoma rate review proceeding before the occ 
this rate review was initiated in september by the occ staff and was concluded by order of the occ on november  under the rate review  og e  the occ staff  the oklahoma attorney general and other interested parties agreed to a settlement agreement which stipulated that og e would file tariffs  designed to reflect an annual reduction of million in og e s oklahoma jurisdictional operating revenue 
the million annual reduction began on january  the settlement agreement addressed the importance of og e acquiring new generation 
see regulation and rates pending acquisition of power plant for the issues facing og e in its acquisition of the mcclain plant in accordance with the settlement agreement 
other elements of importance addressed in the settlement agreement included a modification of the sharing ratio of off system sales and the recognition of the reduction of cogeneration costs in og e s retail rates in the years and beyond 
og e also received occ approval in the settlement agreement for several new customer programs and rate options  as well as modifications to existing rate structures 
the guaranteed flat bill gfb option for residential and small general service accounts allows qualifying customers the opportunity to purchase their electricity needs at a set price for an entire year 
budget minded customers that desire a fixed monthly bill benefit from the gfb option 
a second tariff rate option approved in the settlement agreement is an offering to provide a renewable energy resource to og e s oklahoma retail customers 
this renewable energy resource is a wind power purchase program and is available as a voluntary option to all of og e s oklahoma retail customers 
oklahoma s availability of wind resources makes the renewable wind power option a possible choice in meeting the renewable energy needs of our conservation minded customers 
a third new rate offering available to commercial and industrial customers is levelized demand billing 
this program is beneficial for medium to large size customers with seasonally consistent demand levels who wish to reduce the variability of their monthly electric bills 
the levelized demand offering is not for every customer  but many customers will benefit from this program 
the last new program being offered to og e s commercial and industrial customers and approved by the occ is a new voluntary load curtailment program 
this program provides customers with the opportunity to curtail on a voluntary basis when og e s system conditions merit curtailment action 
customers that curtail their usage will receive payment for their curtailment response 
this voluntary curtailment program seeks customers that can curtail on most curtailment event days  but may not be able to curtail every time that a curtailment event is required 
the previously discussed new rate options coupled with og e s existing rate choices provide many tariff options for og e s oklahoma retail customers 
og e s rate choice flexibility  reduction in cogeneration rates  acquisition of additional generation resources and overall low costs of production and deliverability are expected to provide valuable benefits for our customers for many years to come 
og e began implementation of the new rate options during the first billing cycle in january since many of these options are voluntary  customers may choose these options anytime after the january start date 
the revenue impacts associated with these options are indeterminate in future years since customers may choose to remain on existing rate options instead of volunteering for the new rate option choices 
there was no overall material impact in associated with these new rate options  but minimal revenue variations may occur in the future based upon changes in customers usage characteristics if they choose these new programs 
fuel supply during  approximately percent of the og e generated energy was produced by coal units and percent by natural gas units 
of the  total mw capability reflected in the table under item properties  approximately  mws or percent are from natural gas generation and approximately  mws or percent are from coal generation 
though og e has a higher installed capability of generation from natural gas units of percent  it has been more economical to generate electricity for our customers using lower priced coal 
a slight decline in the percentage of coal generation in future years is expected to result from increased usage of natural gas generation required to meet growing energy needs 
over the last five years  the average cost of fuel used  by type  per million british thermal unit mmbtu was as follows coal natural gas weighted average a portion of the fuel cost is included in base rates and differs for each jurisdiction 
the portion of these costs that is not included in base rates is recovered through automatic fuel adjustment clauses 
see regulation and rates automatic fuel adjustment clauses 
coal all of og e s coal units  with an aggregate capability of approximately  mws  are designed to burn low sulfur western coal 
og e purchases coal primarily under long term contracts expiring in and during  og e purchased approximately million tons of coal from the following wyoming suppliers kennecott energy company  arch coal inc  peabody coal sales company and triton coal company 
the combination of all coal has a weighted average sulfur content of less than percent and can be burned in these units under existing federal  state and local environmental standards maximum of lbs 
of sulfur dioxide per mmbtu without the addition of sulfur dioxide removal systems 
based upon the average sulfur content  og e s units have an approximate emission rate of lbs 
of sulfur dioxide per mmbtu well within the limitations of the provisions of phase ii of the clean air act 
og e has continued its efforts to maximize the utilization of its coal units at both the sooner and muskogee generating plants 
see environmental matters for a discussion of an environmental proposal that  if implemented as proposed  could inhibit og e s ability to use coal as its primary boiler fuel 
natural gas og e utilized a request for bid rfb to acquire approximately percent of its projected annual natural gas requirements through approximately april these contracts are tied to various gas price market indices and most will expire in april a significant portion of future gas requirements of og e will be secured through a new multi year rfb that was issued in february with deliveries to begin in april additional gas requirements of og e will be met with monthly and day to day purchases as required 
in  og e began utilizing a natural gas storage facility that allows og e to optimize the use of its generation assets 
natural gas pipeline operations enogex the operations of the natural gas pipeline segment are conducted through enogex and consist of three related businesses i the transportation and storage of natural gas  ii the gathering and processing of natural gas and iii the marketing and trading of natural gas 
enogex s focus is to utilize its gathering  processing  transportation and storage capacity to execute physical  financial and service transactions to capture revenues across different commodities  locations  or time periods 
the vast majority of enogex s natural gas gathering  processing  transportation and storage assets are located in the major gas producing basins of oklahoma 
enogex and its subsidiaries operate approximately  miles of intrastate gas gathering and transportation pipelines 
additionally  through a percent interest in noark  enogex also owns a controlling interest in and operates ozark  an approximately mile ferc regulated interstate pipeline that extends from southeast oklahoma through arkansas to southeast missouri 
enogex was previously engaged in the exploration and production of natural gas  however  this portion of enogex s business  along with interests in certain gas gathering and processing assets in texas  were sold in and in the first quarter of and are reported in the consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations 
the transportation  storage and gathering assets of enogex provide og e strategic access to natural gas supplies  and flexible and reliable delivery terms that are required to fuel og e s natural gas fired generation facilities 
natural gas generation peaking units require the ability to quickly change their status  to meet both the peak and off peak demands of the retail load particularly when coal units have an unscheduled outage 
the gathering assets access major wellhead supply sources primarily located across oklahoma and arkansas  and the integrated transportation and storage assets provide the ability to regulate the receipt and delivery of natural gas to match the instantaneous needs of these generation units 
natural gas fired generation units contribute their highest value when they have the capability to provide load following service to the customer 
while the physical characteristics of natural gas units are known to provide quick start up and on line functionality  and while their ability to efficiently provide varying levels of electric generation relative to other forms of generation is further acknowledged  their ultimate effectiveness is contingent upon having access to an integrated pipeline and storage system that can respond in a short term fashion to meet its corresponding fluctuating operational fuel requirements 
the combination of these assets is critical to a generator s ability to provide reliable generation service at reasonable prices to the consumer 
not only is enogex providing service to og e  but enogex s same assets provide firm and interruptible services to a significant portion of the other natural gas fired generation loads in the state of oklahoma and numerous other generation loads in the adjoining states of texas and arkansas 
enogex understands the needs of generators  and more importantly has the appropriately sized pipelines  compression and integrated storage assets necessary to meet their requirements 
through enogex s gathering and processing assets  enogex aggregates gas supplies for both its own markets  and also for those markets accessible via its numerous intrastate and interstate pipeline connections 
it aggressively pursues new supplies from wells drilled by producers primarily in the anadarko and arkoma basins 
oklahoma ranks third in the nation in natural gas production 
the system capacity  due to its large diameter gathering pipelines and its natural gas processing plants  is capable of adapting to the varying pressure and quality requirements of mid continent production 
enogex is able to provide low pressure service to extend the production life of older wells as well as meeting the high pressure requirements of new exploration 
enogex is also able to remove natural gas liquids from the wellhead gas streams  by processing the gas  which would otherwise prevent such gas from meeting the british thermal unit btu and quality specifications of the downstream marketplace and therefore could not be produced 
the activities described above  while central to enogex s operations  are not its only businesses 
the transportation capabilities and on and off system markets of the pipeline assets provide other business opportunities 
this equally important and valuable feature of enogex and its assets is the ability of enogex to use its pipeline system and storage assets as a market hub 
at december   excluding the pipeline connection between its intrastate pipeline and the ozark pipeline  enogex was connected to other major pipelines at approximately pipeline interconnect points providing access to markets in the western united states  the mid west  northeast  and gulf coast in addition to oklahoma and adjoining states 
therefore  regardless of the constantly varying relationship between supply and demand  both in volume and location  enogex s assets sit in a key geographic region of the united states  with sufficient capacity to provide cross haul transportation and storage services to a variety of utility and industrial customers that need to access mid continent supply for their own needs  or to suppliers from other regions seeking to provide gas to on system markets which enogex serves 
enogex s marketing and trading business is an important element in realizing the full value of its transportation and storage assets and in providing products and services that support the market hub concept 
the marketing and trading business offers the company real time and longer term price discovery and valuation of energy commodities natural gas and associated natural gas liquids associated with the company s assets 
the marketing and trading business also is instrumental in providing increased liquidity for these energy commodities  by focusing on developing supplies and markets that can access the enogex systems either directly or via interconnections with intrastate and interstate pipelines 
the marketing and trading business also provides the company the capability of providing risk management services to its customers 
the company intends to continue to build upon the foundation of services and products that these assets can provide 
in addition  the company expects to generate additional margins by improving its ability to aggregate gas  maximize the operational capabilities of its assets and utilize commercial information available from the marketplace 
recent actions beginning in  enogex evaluated  redesigned and reorganized its internal work processes and senior management structure in order to achieve cost reductions  revenue enhancements and strategic leadership within its businesses 
after a review of enogex s assets on the basis of their strategic value and other factors  the company sold all of its exploration and production assets and its interest in belvan corp  belvan limited partnership and todd ranch limited partnership belvan in and its interest in the nustar joint venture nustar in february these dispositions have been reported as discontinued operations for the years ended december   and in the consolidated financial statements 
in addition to these ongoing efforts  in enogex began a major upgrade of its information systems that is expected to be substantially completed by the end of the company believes that these upgrades will be a major step towards obtaining the data required to allow it to capture available economic opportunities on its assets  provide improved customer service and enable management to more accurately determine the earnings potential of its various assets and service offerings 
other efforts at enogex during included improvements to its two storage fields 
the repair project at the wetumka storage facility formerly known as greasy creek was designed to mitigate any potential gas migration  and the remediation program at the stuart storage facility once completed is intended to prevent water encroachment in the field 
during  approximately million was spent and expensed on the wetumka storage facility project and approximately million in capital expenditures was spent on the stuart storage facility project  the company expects no material future expenditures at the wetumka storage facility and expenditures of less than million for the stuart storage facility 
during the fourth quarter of  the company recognized a pre tax impairment loss of approximately million which related to enogex natural gas processing and compression assets 
in the fourth quarter of  as a result of an ongoing initiative to improve asset utilization  the company concluded that certain idle enogex natural gas compression assets may no longer be required to meet the company s future business needs 
as a result  the company recognized a pre tax impairment loss of approximately million related to these natural gas compression assets 
the impairments resulted from plans to dispose of these assets at prices below the carrying amount 
the fair value of these assets was determined based on third party evaluations  prices for similar assets  historical data and projected cash flows 
the carrying amount of these assets held for sale was approximately million at december  the company is actively marketing these assets and has developed a plan to sell these assets within one year 
on august   ozark  in which an enogex subsidiary owns a percent interest  entered into an agreement of sale and purchase with centerpoint energy gas transmission co 
to sell approximately miles of transmission lines of the ozark pipeline located in pittsburg and latimer counties in oklahoma for approximately million 
on november   the company received ferc approval for the closing  which occurred on january  the company recorded approximately a million pre tax gain and approximately million in minority interest expense in the first quarter of related to the sale of these assets 
ferc section rate case in december  enogex made its filing at the ferc under section of the natural gas policy act to establish rates and a default processing fee and to address various other issues for the combined enogex and transok llc pipeline systems 
by order dated may   the ferc accepted the stipulation and settlement agreement and entered its order modifying enogex s statement of operating conditions soc 
the ferc order required enogex to modify its soc to eliminate the priority for scheduling and curtailment purposes for interruptible dedicated gas customers 
in june  apache corporation apache and the oklahoma independent petroleum association oipa sought rehearing as to the elimination of the priority for dedicated gas 
the ferc issued a tolling order on july   and by order dated january   the ferc denied the apache and oipa requests for rehearing and affirmed its may order 
the time for judicial appeal of the january  order has not yet expired 
the settlement included a fee to be assessed under certain market conditions to process customer gas gathered behind processing plants so that it meets pipeline gas quality btu standards and can be redelivered to interstate pipelines default processing fee 
the default processing fee  which decreases the volatility of its earnings stream by reducing its exposure to keep whole processing arrangements  is implemented in the event the fractionation spreads the difference between the price of natural gas liquids extracted and natural gas are negative 
the settlement also approved a monthly low flow meter charge of offset in any month by the transportation revenues generated by gas through the meter 
pursuant to enogex s soc  if enogex s annual processing gross margin on revenues exceeds a specified threshold  enogex is required to record a default processing fee refund obligation in an amount equal to the lesser of the default processing fees and the amount of the processing margin in excess of the specified threshold 
during the third and fourth quarters of  the company established approximately a million reserve  based on projected future market conditions  to cover such refund obligations 
for the year ended december   the company recognized revenue  net of the million reserve  of approximately million for default processing fees and approximately million of low flow meter charges 
for  enogex s forecasted processing gross margin exceeds the threshold calculated under the terms of the soc 
as a result  any default processing fees charged to customers will be recorded as deferred revenue until it becomes probable that the gross margin threshold in the soc will not be exceeded during the accounting for default processing fees is not expected to impact full year earnings  but could affect the timing of those earnings 
transportation and storage general 
one of enogex s primary lines of business is the transportation of natural gas  with current throughput of approximately billion cubic feet per day bcfd 
enogex delivers natural gas to most interstate and intrastate pipelines and end users connected to its systems from the arkoma basin of eastern oklahoma and arkansas  the anadarko basin of western oklahoma and the panhandle of west texas 
at december   excluding the pipeline connection between its intrastate pipeline and the ozark pipeline  enogex was connected to other major pipelines at approximately pipelines interconnect points 
these interconnections include panhandle eastern pipe line  southern star central gas pipeline formerly williams central  natural gas pipeline company of america  oneok gas transmission  northern natural gas company  anr pipeline  western farmers electric cooperative  centerpoint energy gas transmission co  black marlin pipeline  el paso natural gas pipeline  kansas pipeline and oneok westex transmission lp  as well as connections via enogex s ozark system to texas eastern and mississippi river transmission 
further  enogex is connected to various end users including numerous electric generation facilities in oklahoma that are fueled by natural gas 
at december   the net property  plant and equipment balance for enogex s transportation and storage business was approximately million 
enogex owns two storage facilities in oklahoma  the wetumka storage facility and the stuart storage facility 
these storage facilities are currently being operated at a working gas level of approximately billion cubic feet bcf with an approximate withdrawal capability of million cubic feet per day mmcfd and similar injection capability 
enogex offers both firm and interruptible storage services to third parties  under section of the natural gas policy act ngpa  under terms and conditions specified in its statement of conditions for gas storage and at market based rates to be negotiated with each customer 
during  enogex expensed approximately million for natural gas inventory losses associated with the wetumka storage facility 
while some gas losses are normally associated with the operation of a natural gas storage field  the amount exceeded acceptable levels 
the stuart storage facility is used to support enogex s intrastate transportation and storage services for og e 
during  enogex made improvements to these two storage fields 
the repair project at the wetumka storage facility was designed to mitigate any potential gas migration  and the remediation program at the stuart storage facility once completed is intended to prevent water encroachment in the field 
during  approximately million was spent and expensed on the wetumka storage facility project and approximately million in capital expenditures was spent on the stuart storage facility project  the company expects no material future expenditures at the wetumka storage facility and expenditures of less than million for the stuart storage facility 
see item legal proceedings for a discussion of the pending litigation associated with the stuart storage facility 
enogex offers interruptible section transportation services as well as both firm and interruptible services to intrastate customers with a majority of transportation revenues derived from firm contracts 
enogex offers interruptible service to customers when capacity is available 
effective january   the enogex and transok llc and its subsidiary entities transok merged thereby simplifying for both enogex and its customers the administration and operation of maintaining two separate pipelines 
enogex provides firm intrastate transportation services to og e as well as public service company of oklahoma pso  the second largest electric utility in oklahoma  serving the tulsa market 
in july  enogex acquired transok 
transok maintained a sole supplier relationship with pso until  when oklahoma natural gas began supplying gas to three of the pso generating stations pursuant to a competitive bid process put in place by the occ 
notwithstanding the loss of the sole supplier status  enogex remains the primary supplier to pso 
enogex continues to provide gas transmission delivery services to all of pso s natural gas fired electric generation units in oklahoma under a firm intrastate transportation contract 
the current pso contract  which expires january   and the og e contract  which expires april   provide for a monthly demand charge plus variable transportation charges including fuel 
as part of the contract with og e  enogex provides additional natural gas storage services for og e 
enogex has been providing these natural gas storage services since august when enogex exercised its option to purchase the stuart storage facility to collect on its judgment against central oklahoma oil and gas corp 
coog 
in addition  enogex provides transportation services via the leased palo duro pipeline system to houston pipe line company hpc  an affiliate of pso  for gas delivery service to certain hpc generating stations in the texas panhandle 
enogex s lease of the palo duro pipeline terminated effective june  on june   enogex sent notice to the ferc indicating that its lease of the palo duro pipeline had terminated  and that enogex would no longer be offering section service to palo duro shippers 
enogex has extended its lease of a small segment of gathering pipeline off of the palo duro system  referred to as the northeast lateral 
the term of the lease extension of the northeast lateral expires february   and will remain in effect month to month thereafter  subject to termination by either enogex or the lessor upon days notice 
though the palo duro system  including the northeast lateral  were sold from the lessor to a third party in  enogex has not received termination notice and continues to operate under the monthly lease terms 
during  and  enogex s revenues from the contracts with og e  pso and hpc were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
relationship with og e 
from its inception  enogex has been the exclusive transporter of natural gas to og e s natural gas fired generation facilities 
although enogex is not directly regulated by the occ  og e s rates are subject to occ jurisdiction 
the occ issued an order on november  which contained a provision  among other things  that og e would consider competitive bidding as an option in obtaining gas transportation service for its natural gas fired generation facilities when the contract with enogex expired 
the term of the then current contract was to expire in april subsequently  this contract was amended by an agreement dated may  with no notice load following requirements and a termination date of april  as part of the contract with og e  enogex provides additional natural gas storage services for og e 
enogex has been providing these natural gas storage services since august when enogex exercised its option to purchase the stuart storage facility to collect on its judgment against coog 
the amount collected from og e by enogex under the current contract for transportation services was approximately million  million and million  respectively  during  and the amount collected from og e by enogex under the current contract for storage services was approximately million and million  respectively  during and enogex did not provide storage services to og e during competition 
enogex s transportation and storage assets compete with interstate and other intrastate pipeline and storage facilities in providing transportation and storage services for natural gas 
the principal elements of competition are rates  terms of services  flexibility and reliability of service 
natural gas competes with other forms of energy available to enogex s customers and end users  including electricity  coal and fuel oils 
the primary competitive factor is price 
changes in the availability or price of natural gas or other forms of energy as well as weather and other factors affect the demand for natural gas on the enogex system 
regulation 
the rates charged by enogex for transporting natural gas on behalf of an interstate natural gas pipeline company or a local distribution company served by an interstate natural gas pipeline company are subject to the jurisdiction of the ferc under section of the ngpa 
rates to provide such service must be fair and equitable under the ngpa and are subject to review and approval by the ferc at least once every three years 
this rate review may involve an administrative type trial and an administrative appellate review 
by offering interruptible section transportation  the regulatory burden on enogex is not appreciably increased  but does give enogex the opportunity to utilize any unused capacity on an interruptible basis in interstate commerce and thus increase its transportation revenues 
see ferc section case for a discussion of enogex s most recent section case 
the company  through enogex  owns a percent interest in ozark 
ozark transports natural gas in interstate commerce 
as a result  ozark qualifies as a natural gas company under the natural gas act of the natural gas act  and is subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the ferc 
under the natural gas act  the ferc has jurisdiction to review and authorize the proposed construction of facilities for the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce  the rendition of service through interstate facilities  the rates charged for such service and the abandonment of such facilities or services 
the natural gas act requires that the rates charged  and the terms and conditions of service observed  by interstate pipelines be just and reasonable  and not unduly discriminatory or preferential 
all rates and terms and conditions of service proposed by an interstate pipeline must be filed with the ferc  and the ferc has jurisdiction under the natural gas act to determine whether proposed rates or terms and conditions meet the statutory standards 
the natural gas act confers upon the ferc authority to determine a jurisdictional pipeline s rates  charges and terms and conditions of service  to establish depreciation rates and to prescribe uniform systems of accounts 
the rates charged by enogex for transporting natural gas for og e and other shippers within oklahoma are not subject to ferc regulation because they are intrastate transactions 
with respect to state regulation  the rates charged by enogex for any intrastate transportation service have not been subject to direct state regulation by the occ  which is the state agency responsible for setting rates of public utilities within oklahoma 
even though the intrastate pipeline business of enogex is not directly regulated by the occ  the occ  the apsc and the ferc all of which approve various electric rates of og e have the authority to examine the appropriateness of any transportation charges or other fees paid by og e to enogex which og e seeks to recover from its ratepayers in its cost of service for electric service 
see relationship with og e above for a discussion of competitive bidding for og e s service 
enogex s pipeline operations are subject to various oklahoma safety and environmental and non discriminatory transportation requirements 
gathering and processing general 
natural gas gathering operations are conducted through enogex gas gathering llc  and natural gas processing operations are conducted through enogex products corporation products 
the streams of processable natural gas gathered from wells and other sources are gathered through enogex s gas gathering systems and delivered to processing plants for the extraction of natural gas liquids 
during  the gathering systems connected approximately producing wells located primarily in the anadarko and arkoma basins of oklahoma and arkansas represented by contracts with producers 
the company provides connection  measurement  treating  dehydration and compression services for various types of producing wells owned by various sized producers who are active in the region 
where the quality of natural gas received dictates that removal of natural gas liquids may be in order  such gas is aggregated via the gathering system to the inlet of one or more of the company s fleet of processing plants operated by products 
the resulting processed stream of natural gas is then delivered via the enogex pipeline system to one or more delivery points into the web of transmission pipelines in the region 
products is one of the largest gas processors in the state of oklahoma  operating six gas processing plants with a total inlet capacity of mmcfd 
during  products had ownership interests in two other gas processing plants related to nustar  which were sold in february in  approximately million gallons of natural gas liquids were produced 
products has been active since in the processing of natural gas and extraction and marketing of natural gas liquids 
the liquids extracted include condensate  marketable ethane  propane  butanes and natural gasoline mix 
the residue gas remaining after the liquid products have been extracted consists primarily of ethane and methane 
at december   the net property  plant and equipment balance for enogex s gathering and processing business was approximately million 
approximately percent of the commercial grade propane processed at products plants is sold on the local market 
the balance of propane and the other natural gas liquids produced by products are delivered into pipeline facilities of koch hydrocarbon and transported to conway  kansas and mont belvieu  texas  where they are sold under contract or on the spot market 
ethane  which may be optionally produced at all of products plants except one  is sold in the spot market 
during  enogex initiated steps to decrease the volatility of its earnings stream by reducing its exposure to keep whole processing arrangements 
keep whole processing arrangements generally require a processor of natural gas to keep its shippers whole on a btu basis by replacing the btu value of the liquids extracted from the well stream with natural gas at market prices 
therefore  if natural gas prices increase and liquids prices do not increase by a corresponding amount  processing margins are negatively affected 
in order to minimize the negative impact on processing margins  ethane and propane are rejected based upon then current market conditions 
exposure to keep whole processing arrangements was reduced through contract renegotiations and changes in the standards of service provided by enogex under the ferc section filing discussed previously that provides for a default processing fee in the event the fractionation spreads the difference between the price of natural gas liquids extracted and natural gas are negative 
as a result  in months in which commodity spreads were negative thus activating the default processing fee allowed in the soc  the exposure to keep whole processing arrangements has been reduced 
further  when market conditions dictated  products took active steps to reduce the amount of natural gas at the plant inlet to approximately percent keep whole without the default processing fee 
in addition  the company actively monitors current and future commodity prices for opportunities to hedge its processing margin 
enogex has executed physical and financial hedges by selling liquids forward as well as hedging the fractionation spread of various liquids components 
as discussed above  the company sold all of its interest in belvan in and its interest in nustar in february competition 
enogex competes with gatherers of all types and sizes  including those affiliated with various producers  other major pipeline companies  as well as various independent gatherers 
in processing and marketing natural gas liquids  products competes against virtually all other gas processors producing and selling natural gas liquids 
competition for natural gas supply is based on efficiency and reliability of operations  reputation  availability of gathering and transportation to markets and pricing arrangements offered by the gatherer processor 
enogex believes it will be able to continue to compete against such companies 
with respect to the profitability of the natural gas liquids industry generally  as the price of natural gas liquids falls without a corresponding decrease in the price of natural gas  it may become uneconomical to extract certain natural gas liquids 
this factor had a significant adverse impact on the results of enogex during but as discussed above  the potential adverse impact has been materially mitigated  but not entirely eliminated 
in addition to the commodity pricing impact that affects the entire industry  the profitability of products is also largely affected by the volume of natural gas processed at its plants which is highly dependent upon the volume and btu content of natural gas gathered 
generally  if the volume of natural gas gathered increases  then the volume of liquids extracted by products should also increase 
marketing and trading enogex s commodity sales and services related to natural gas are conducted primarily through its subsidiary  oge energy resources  inc oeri 
oeri is engaged in the business of natural gas marketing 
oeri s agreements with enogex provide for oeri to provide marketing services for all natural gas volumes purchased by enogex at the wellhead from producers or otherwise 
as a service to the producers on the enogex system  enogex may agree to purchase the gas at the wellhead in conjunction with gathering their gas for transportation to other markets 
oeri also purchases and sells natural gas pursuant to contracts with enogex and products relating to enogex s gathering  processing and storage assets 
prior to the sale of enogex s exploration assets in  oeri marketed the natural gas produced by enogex exploration corporation exploration 
at december   the net property  plant and equipment balance for enogex s marketing and trading business was approximately million 
oeri focuses on serving customers along the natural gas value chain  from producers to end users  by purchasing natural gas from suppliers both on and off the enogex and ozark pipeline systems and reselling to pipelines  local distribution companies and end users  including the electric generation sector 
the geographic scope of marketing efforts has been focused largely in the mid continent area of the united states 
these markets are natural extensions of oeri s business on the enogex system 
oeri contracts for pipeline capacity with enogex and other pipelines to access multiple interconnections with the interstate pipeline system network that moves natural gas from the production basins in the south central united states to the major consumption areas in chicago  new york and other north central and mid atlantic regions of the united states 
oeri participates in both intermediate term markets less than three years and short term spot markets for natural gas 
although oeri continues to increase its focus on intermediate term sales  short term sales of natural gas are expected to continue to play a critical role in the overall strategy because they provide an important source of market intelligence as well as an important portfolio balancing function 
in  oeri bought and sold approximately bcfd of natural gas 
oeri s risk management skills afford its customers the opportunity to tailor the risk profile and composition of their natural gas portfolio 
the company follows a policy of hedging price risk on gas purchases or sales contracts entered into by the marketing group by buying and selling natural gas futures contracts on the new york mercantile exchange futures exchange and other derivatives in the over the counter market  subject to daily and monthly trading stop loss limits of million in accordance with corporate policies 
competition 
oeri competes in marketing and trading natural gas with major integrated oil companies  marketing affiliates of major interstate and intrastate pipelines  national and local natural gas brokers  marketers and distributors for natural gas supplies 
competition for natural gas supplies is based primarily on reputation  credit support  the availability of gathering and transportation to high demand markets and the ability to obtain a satisfactory price for the producer s natural gas 
competition for sales to customers is based primarily upon reliability  services offered and the price of delivered natural gas 
for the year ended december   approximately percent of oeri s service volumes were with electric utilities  local gas distribution companies  pipelines and producers 
the remaining percent of service volumes were to marketers  municipals  cooperatives and industrials 
at december   approximately percent of the exposure was to companies having investment grade ratings with standard poor s ratings services standard poor s and approximately three percent having less than investment grade ratings 
the remaining percent of oeri s exposure is with privately held companies  municipals or cooperatives that were not rated by standard poor s 
oeri applies internal credit analyses and policies to these non rated companies 
exploration and production the company sold all of its exploration and production assets in these dispositions have been reported as discontinued operations for the years ended december   and in the consolidated financial statements 
the exploration and production activities were conducted through exploration  which was formed in primarily to engage in the development and production of oil and natural gas 
exploration focused its early drilling activity in the antrim devonian shale trend in the state of michigan and in recent years had concentrated on drilling opportunities in oklahoma 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations enogex discontinued operations for a further discussion 
finance and construction future capital requirements capital requirements the company s primary needs for capital are related to replacing or expanding existing facilities in og e s electric utility business and replacing or expanding existing facilities at enogex 
other capital requirements are primarily related to maturing debt  operating lease obligations  hedging activities  natural gas storage and delays in recovering unconditional fuel purchase obligations 
the company generally meets its cash needs through a combination of internally generated funds  short term borrowings and permanent financings 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations liquidity and capital requirements for a detailed discussion of the company s capital requirements 
variances in the actual cost of fuel used in electric generation which includes the operating lease obligations for og e s railcar leases and certain purchased power costs  as compared to the fuel component included in the cost of service for ratemaking  are passed through to og e s customers through automatic fuel adjustment clauses 
accordingly  while the cost of fuel related to operating leases and the vast majority of unconditional fuel purchase obligations of og e may increase capital requirements  such costs are recoverable through automatic fuel adjustment clauses and have little  if any  impact on net capital requirements and future contractual obligations 
the automatic fuel adjustment clauses are subject to periodic review by the occ  the apsc and the ferc 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion 
capital expenditures the company s current to construction program includes the purchase of new generation as discussed below 
og e currently has contracts with qualified cogeneration facilities and small power production producers qf contracts for the purchase of mws  all of which expire in the next one to five years 
the company will continue reviewing all of the supply alternatives to replace expiring qf contracts that minimize the total cost of generation to our customers 
accordingly  og e will continue to explore opportunities to build or buy power plants in order to serve its native load 
as a result of the high volatility of current natural gas prices and the increase in natural gas prices  og e will also assess the feasibility of constructing additional base load coal fired units 
see regulation and rates pending acquisition of power plant for a description of current proceedings involving a powersmith qf contract 
on august   og e signed an asset purchase agreement to acquire nrg mcclain llc s percent interest in the mw mcclain plant 
the purchase price for the interest in the mcclain plant is approximately million  subject to adjustment for prepaid gas and property taxes 
closing is currently delayed in response to an order of the ferc 
see regulation and rates pending acquisition of power plant 
if approval is received  funding for the acquisition is to be provided by proceeds received by the company from its equity offering in the third quarter of  and a debt issuance by og e 
to reliably meet the increased electricity needs of og e s customers during the foreseeable future  og e will continue to invest to maintain the integrity of the delivery system 
approximately million of the company s capital expenditures budgeted for are to comply with environmental laws and regulations 
future sources of financing general management expects that internally generated funds  funds received from the equity offering  proceeds from the sales of common stock pursuant to the company s automatic dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan drip and short term debt will be adequate over the next three years to meet other anticipated capital expenditures  operating needs  payment of dividends and maturities of long term debt 
as discussed below  the company utilizes short term debt to satisfy temporary working capital needs and as an interim source of financing capital expenditures until permanent financing is arranged 
the company issued equity in the third quarter of and issued common stock pursuant to the drip during later in  assuming the acquisition of the mcclain plant is approved by the ferc  og e plans to issue debt to fund the purchase of the mcclain plant and for general corporate purposes and the company plans to issue common stock pursuant to the drip during short term debt short term borrowings generally are used to meet working capital requirements 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital requirements future sources of financing for a table showing the company s lines of credit in place and available cash at january  short term borrowings are expected to consist of a combination of bank borrowings and commercial paper 
the company s ability to access the commercial paper market could be adversely impacted by a commercial paper ratings downgrade 
the lines of credit contain rating grids that require annual fees and borrowing rates to increase if the company suffers an adverse ratings impact 
the impact of additional downgrades of the company s rating would result in an increase in the cost of short term borrowings of approximately five to basis points  but would not result in any defaults or accelerations as a result of the rating changes 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital requirements future capital requirements for potential financing needs upon a downgrade by moody s investors service moody s of enogex s long term debt rating 
unlike the company and enogex  og e must obtain regulatory approval from the ferc in order to borrow on a short term basis 
og e has the necessary regulatory approvals to incur up to million in short term borrowings at any one time 
security ratings in january and february  standard poor s and moody s lowered many of the credit ratings of oge energy corp 
s  og e s and enogex s debt 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital requirements future capital requirements for a more detailed discussion of such credit rating agency actions 
asset sales also contributing to the liquidity of the company have been numerous asset sales by enogex 
since january   completed sales generated net proceeds of approximately million 
sales proceeds generated to date have been used to reduce debt at enogex and commercial paper at the holding company 
the company continues to evaluate opportunities to enhance shareowner returns and achieve long term financial objectives through acquisitions and divestitures of assets that may complement its existing portfolio 
permanent financing would be required for any such acquisitions 
environmental matters approximately million of the company s capital expenditures budgeted for are to comply with environmental laws and regulations 
the company s management believes that all of its operations are in substantial compliance with present federal  state and local environmental standards 
it is estimated that the company s total expenditures for capital  operating  maintenance and other costs to preserve and enhance environmental quality will be approximately million during  compared to approximately million utilized in the company continues to evaluate its environmental management systems to ensure compliance with existing and proposed environmental legislation and regulations and to better position itself in a competitive market 
in  several pieces of national legislation were either introduced or reintroduced after having failed to pass in these bills could have required the reduction in emissions of sulfur dioxide so  nitrogen oxide nox  carbon dioxide co and mercury from the electric utility industry 
among the bills was president bush s clear skies proposal 
while not addressing co  this bill would require significant reductions in so  nox and mercury emissions 
as in  none of the proposed legislation became law  however  it is expected that numerous multi pollutant bills will again be introduced in as required by title iv of the clean air act amendments of caaa  og e completed installation and certification of all required continuous emissions monitors at its generating stations in since then  og e has submitted emissions data quarterly to the environmental protection agency epa as required by the caaa 
beginning in  og e became subject to more stringent so emission requirements 
these lower limits had no significant financial impact due to og e s earlier decision to burn low sulfur coal 
in  og e s so emissions were well below the allowable limits 
with respect to the nox regulations of title iv of the caaa  og e committed to meeting a lbs mmbtu nox emission level in on all coal fired boilers 
as a result  og e was eligible to exercise its option to extend the effective date of the lower emission requirements from the year until og e s average nox emissions from its coal fired boilers for were lbs mmbtu 
however  further reductions in nox emissions could be required if  among other things  legislation is enacted  a study currently being conducted by the state of oklahoma determines that such nox emissions are contributing to regional haze and that og e s facilities impact the air quality of the tulsa or oklahoma city metropolitan areas  or if oklahoma fails to meet the new fine particulate standards 
any of these scenarios would require significant capital and operating expenditures 
the oklahoma department of environmental quality s clean air act amendment title v permitting program was approved by the epa in march by march of  og e had submitted all required permit applications 
as of december   og e had received title v permits for all but one of its generating stations 
since og e submitted all of its permit applications on time it is considered in compliance with the title v permit program even though all permits have not been issued 
air permit fees for generating stations were approximately million in the fees for are estimated to be approximately the same as in other potential air regulations have emerged that could impact og e 
on december   the epa proposed regulations to limit mercury emissions from coal fired boilers 
this rule is expected to be finalized by early earliest compliance by og e would be january depending upon the final regulations  this could result in significant capital and operating expenditures 
in addition  on december   the epa proposed an interstate air quality rule 
this rule is intended to control so and nox from utility boilers in order to minimize the interstate transport of air pollution 
in the proposed rule  the state of oklahoma is exempt from any reductions 
however this could change as the epa has indicated its intentions to review oklahoma s impact on other states 
if oklahoma is included in the final rule reductions  this could lead to significant capital and operating expenditures by og e 
in  the epa finalized revisions to the ambient ozone and particulate standards 
after a court challenge  which delayed implementation  the epa has now begun to finalize the implementation process 
based on the most recent monitoring data  oklahoma s governor in july of proposed to the epa that the entire state be designated attainment with the ozone standard 
later in the epa approved oklahoma s request 
however  both tulsa and oklahoma city had previously entered into an early action compact with the epa whereby voluntary measures will be enacted to reduce ozone 
in order to ensure that ozone levels remain below the standards  both cities intend to comply with the compact 
minimal impact on og e s operations is expected 
the epa also has issued regulations concerning regional haze 
these regulations are intended to protect visibility in national parks and wilderness areas throughout the united states 
in oklahoma  the wichita mountains would be the only area covered under the regulation 
however  oklahoma s impact on parks in other states must also be evaluated 
sulfates and nitrate aerosols both emitted from coal fired boilers can lead to the degradation of visibility 
the state of oklahoma has joined with eight other central states and has begun the process of determining what  if any  impact emission sources in oklahoma have on national parks and wilderness areas 
if an impact is determined  then significant capital expenditures could be required for both the sooner and muskogee generating stations 
while the united states has withdrawn its support of the kyoto protocol on global warming  legislation has been considered which would limit co emissions 
president bush supports voluntary reductions by industry 
og e has joined other utilities in voluntary co sequestration projects through reforestation of land in the southern united states 
in addition  og e has committed to reduce its co emission rate lbs 
co mwh by up to five percent over the next years 
however  if legislation is passed requiring mandatory reductions this could have a tremendous impact on og e s operations by requiring og e to significantly reduce the use of coal as a fuel source 
og e has sought  and will continue to seek  new pollution prevention opportunities and to evaluate the effectiveness of its waste reduction  reuse and recycling efforts 
in  og e obtained refunds of approximately million from its recycling efforts 
this figure does not include the additional savings gained through the reduction and or avoidance of disposal costs and the reduction in material purchases due to the reuse of existing materials 
similar savings are anticipated in future years 
og e has submitted three applications during to renew its oklahoma pollution discharge elimination system permits 
og e anticipates that the renewed permits will continue to allow operational flexibility 
og e requested  based on the performance of a site specific study  that the state agency responsible for the development of water quality standards adjust the in stream copper criterion at one of its facilities 
adjustment of this criterion should allow the facility to avoid costly treatment and or facility reconfiguration requirements 
the state and the epa have approved the new in stream criteria for copper 
section b of the clean water act requires that the location  design  construction and capacity of any cooling water intake structure reflect the best available technology for minimizing environmental impacts 
the epa s original rules on this issue were set aside in by the fourth circuit us court of appeals 
in  the epa announced its plan to develop new rules in part due to a lawsuit filed by the hudson riverkeeper 
to settle the lawsuit  the epa signed a court approved consent decree to develop b regulations 
final rules for existing utility sources were approved on february  depending on the analysis of these final b rules  capital and or operating costs may increase at some of og e s generating facilities 
the construction and operation of pipelines  plants and other facilities for gathering  processing  treating  transporting or storing natural gas and other products may be subject to federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations  including those that can impose obligations to clean up any potential releases of hazardous substances at the locations at which enogex operates 
in most instances  the applicable regulatory requirements relate to water and air pollution control or solid waste management measures 
appropriate governmental authorities may enforce these laws and regulations with a variety of civil and criminal enforcement measures  including monetary penalties  assessment and remediation requirements and injunctions as to future compliance 
enogex generates some materials subject to the requirements of the federal resource conservation and recovery act and the clean water act and comparable state statutes  prepares and files reports and documents pursuant to the toxic substance control act and the emergency planning and community right to know act and obtains permits pursuant to the federal clean air act and comparable state air statutes 
environmental regulation can increase the cost of planning  design  initial installation and operation of enogex s facilities 
historically  enogex s total expenditures for environmental control facilities and for remediation have not been significant in relation to its results of operations or financial condition 
the company believes  however  that it is reasonably likely that the trend in environmental legislation and regulations will continue to be towards stricter standards 
beginning in  the company began a process to evaluate  determine and report emissions from its pipeline facilities for compliance with recently promulgated maximum achievable control technology regulations 
after evaluating the submitted information  the oklahoma department of environmental quality odeq  beginning in late  issued notices of violation regarding potential air permitting issues at certain of these reported facilities 
generally  the notices alleged violations relating to potential sources of various emissions  with the majority of the sources relating to glycol dehydrators 
the company has resolved all these matters and  in compliance with consent orders entered between the parties  the company has taken action to submit or modify permits  install control equipment  modify reporting procedures and pay penalties 
see item legal proceedings for a further discussion of this matter 
the company has and will continue to evaluate the impact of its operations on the environment

in a dispute arose as to whether the natural gas deliverability for the stuart storage facility was being provided by coog and these issues were submitted to arbitration in october and november in july  the oklahoma district court affirmed the arbitration award and entered judgment against coog and in favor of enogex in the amount of approximately million the judgment 
on july   enogex exercised the asset purchase option provided in the agreement and title to the stuart storage facility was transferred to enogex on october   effective august  the date coog turned over operations of the facility to enogex 
as part of the agreement  the company agreed in to make up to a million secured loan to natural gas storage corporation ngsc  an affiliate of coog the ngsc loan

coog and ngsc have also stated claims for breach of contract relating to the same allegations in its claim for declaratory relief and include claims for attorneys fees 
the company objected to being sued in texas because the texas court does not have proper jurisdiction over the company 
on september   enogex filed an answer in response to the allegations  asserting  among other things  that the disputed issues have already been properly determined by the arbitration panel and the oklahoma court and  therefore  this action is improper 
on february   enogex sent its arbitration demand to plaintiffs coog and ngsc regarding the issues between plaintiffs and enogex in the texas action  and enogex named its arbitrator

enogex filed its proof of claim on january   for approximately million 
in april  enogex negotiated a settlement and received approximately million in may on july   farmland filed its disclosure statement for its reorganization plan for approval by the bankruptcy court 
according to the disclosure statement  farmland proposes to pay its general unsecured creditors an amount between percent and percent on their pre petition claims 
as a general unsecured creditor of farmland and pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement referenced above  enogex s recovery under the proposed distribution would be approximately million  which is in addition to the million enogex received in may on october   the city of jenks  oklahoma filed a petition in state district court in tulsa county  oklahoma against enogex inc seeking damages associated with enogex s alleged failure to remit a gross receipts tax to the city relating to natural gas sold to an ipp  green country energy  llc green country within the city limits 
based on this claim  the city alleged damages in excess of  the city claimed that some of enogex s pipelines are located within the city s public rights of way  and therefore  based on city ordinance  any sale of natural gas by enogex to green country is subject to a two percent gross receipts tax 
the city made an identical claim against two other defendants  green country and exelon generation company  llc  exelon as the supplier of natural gas to green country 
the city also sought interest on the amount in controversy  as well as its court costs and attorneys fees 
additionally  the city asserted other claims against exelon and green country pursuant to two other city ordinances 
on december   enogex and the other defendants filed answers denying plaintiff s claims 
on may   the city and green country filed a joint motion to approve a settlement 
on may   the court entered an order approving the settlement  whereby green country agreed to pay the city million in lieu of any other taxes or fees that may be assessed by the city for the next years 
the claims asserted by the city against green country were all dismissed 
the city also dismissed the claims against exelon that were asserted against green country 
the remaining claim asserted against enogex and exelon related to the gross receipts tax was not dismissed  however  enogex s position is that the settlement between green country and the city effectively resolved the gross receipts tax issue 
nonetheless  enogex cannot guarantee that the city will not continue to pursue the gross receipts tax matter  or other similar matters  against enogex

effective july   the contracts were assigned to calpine energy services  lp calpine energy 
in february  enogex requested a prepayment from calpine energy due to calpine falling below the contractual creditworthiness criteria 
calpine energy refused to pay the full monthly demand fees and also refused to make any prepayments as requested 
enogex also made a demand on calpine corporation  as guarantor  relating to calpine energy s failure to make the required prepayment and demand payments 
in september  calpine energy and calpine corporation filed a lawsuit against enogex in connection with this matter 
after participating in a court ordered mediation on august   the parties reached a settlement of the pending issues on september  the terms of the settlement obligated calpine energy to make a nonrefundable payment to enogex in the amount of million and to maintain a prepayment 
enogex agreed to apply a credit of million to the final two months demand charges under the transportation contract

og e has been sued by kaiser francis oil company in district court  blaine county  oklahoma 
this case has been pending for more than years 
plaintiff alleges that og e breached the terms of numerous contracts covering approximately wells by failing to purchase gas from plaintiff in amounts set forth in the contracts 
plaintiff seeks million in take or pay damages and million in underpayment damages 
over the objection and unsuccessful appeal by og e  plaintiff has been permitted to amend its petition to include a claim based on theories of tort 
specifically  plaintiff alleges  among other things  that og e intentionally and tortuously interfered with contracts by falsifying documents  sponsoring false testimony and putting forward legal defenses  which are known by og e to be without merit 
if successful  plaintiff believes that these theories could give plaintiff a basis to seek punitive damages 
og e believes that  to the extent plaintiff were successful on the merits of its claims of og e s failure to take gas  these amounts would be recoverable through its regulated electric rates 
the claims related to tortuous conduct  which og e believes at this time are without merit  would not appear to be properly recoverable in its rates 
this lawsuit has been stayed pending the outcome of an appeal that og e filed in a similar case brought by kaiser francis in grady county 
in the grady case  og e is appealing a verdict against it in the amount of approximately million  including pre judgment interest and attorneys fees 
while the company cannot predict the precise outcome of the grady case or this lawsuit  the company believes  based on the information known at this time  that this lawsuit will not have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
beginning in  the company began a process to evaluate  determine and report emissions from its pipeline facilities for compliance with recently promulgated maximum achievable control technology regulations 
after evaluating the submitted information  the odeq  beginning in late  issued notices of violation regarding potential air permitting issues at certain of these reported facilities 
generally  the notices alleged violations relating to potential sources to emit various emissions  with the majority of the sources relating to glycol dehydrators 
as previously reported  all but two of the notices were resolved in and enogex has worked with the odeq regarding the two remaining notices  the clinton gas plant and the strong city compressor station  as well as two additional notices relating to air permitting issues that were issued by the odeq in november and january  respectively  relating to the cox city compressor station and the comanche tap gas plant 
enogex has resolved all four of these notices and agreed to pay  in the aggregate  less than million in settlement  which included monies for supplemental environmental projects  penalties and certain remediation efforts 
on july   representatives of enogex met with the ferc staff to discuss resolution of a pending matter that enogex discovered and brought to the ferc s attention in november relating to construction by ozark under its blanket certificate and enogex under section authorization 
the matter disclosed to the ferc relates to minor construction in and that was performed under the reasonable belief that the facilities constituted non jurisdictional gathering 
accordingly  pre construction environmental clearances for the ferc jurisdictional facilities were not obtained and the construction was not reported on blanket certificate and section construction reports

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and and results of operations 
introduction oge energy corp 
collectively  with its subsidiaries  the company is an energy and energy services provider offering physical delivery and management of both electricity and natural gas in the south central united states 
the company conducts these activities through two business segments  the electric utility and the natural gas pipeline segments 
the electric utility segment generates  transmits  distributes and sells electric energy in oklahoma and western arkansas 
its operations are conducted through oklahoma gas and electric company og e and are subject to regulation by the oklahoma corporation commission occ  the arkansas public service commission apsc and the federal energy regulatory commission ferc 
og e was incorporated in under the laws of the oklahoma territory and is the largest electric utility in oklahoma and its franchised service territory includes the fort smith  arkansas area 
og e sold its retail gas business in and is no longer engaged in the gas distribution business 
the operations of the natural gas pipeline segment are conducted through enogex inc and its subsidiaries enogex and consist of three related businesses i the transportation and storage of natural gas  ii the gathering and processing of natural gas and iii the marketing and trading of natural gas collectively  enogex s businesses 
enogex s focus is to utilize its gathering  processing  transportation and storage capacity to execute physical  financial and service transactions to capture revenues across different commodities  locations or time periods 
the vast majority of enogex s natural gas gathering  processing  transportation and storage assets are located in the major gas producing basins of oklahoma 
through a percent interest in the noark pipeline system limited partnership  enogex also owns a controlling interest in and operates the ozark gas transmission system ozark  a ferc regulated interstate pipeline that extends from southeast oklahoma through arkansas to southeast missouri 
enogex was previously engaged in the exploration and production of natural gas  however  this portion of enogex s business  along with interests in certain gas gathering and processing assets in texas  were sold in and in the first quarter of and are reported in the consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations 
company strategy in early  the company completed a review of its business strategy that was largely driven by the anticipated deregulation of the retail electric markets in oklahoma and arkansas 
due to a variety of factors  including the current efforts to repeal the oklahoma electric restructuring act of and the recent repeal of the restructuring law in arkansas  the company does not anticipate that deregulation of the electricity markets in oklahoma or arkansas will occur in the foreseeable future 
the strategic direction of the company has been revised to reflect these developments 
as a result  the company expects potentially slower earnings growth than associated with deregulation but with less variability of those earnings 
the company s revised business strategy will utilize the diversified asset position of og e and enogex to provide energy products and services to customers primarily in the south central united states 
the company will focus on those products and services with limited or manageable commodity exposure 
the company intends for og e to continue as a vertically integrated utility engaged in the generation  transmission and the distribution of electricity and to represent over time approximately percent of the company s consolidated assets 
the remainder of the company s consolidated assets will be in enogex s businesses 
at december   og e and enogex represented approximately percent and percent  respectively  of the company s consolidated assets 
the remaining four percent of the company s consolidated assets were primarily at the holding company 
in addition to the incremental growth opportunities that enogex provides  the company believes that enogex s risk management capabilities  commercial skills and market information provide value to all of the company s businesses 
federal regulation in regard to the operations of the wholesale power market may change with the evolving policy at the ferc 
in addition  oklahoma and arkansas legislatures and utility commissions may propose changes from time to time that could subject utilities to market risk 
accordingly  the company is applying risk management practices to all of its operations in an effort to mitigate the potential adverse effect of any future regulatory changes 
in the near term  og e plans on increasing its investment and growing earnings largely through the acquisition of electric generation new generation 
as discussed in more detail below  in august  og e signed an asset purchase agreement to acquire nrg mcclain llc s percent interest in the megawatt mw nrg mcclain station the mcclain plant 
in december  the ferc delayed approval of the acquisition citing market power concerns 
on january   the ferc administrative law judge in charge of the hearing and the parties to the case agreed to a procedural schedule that would produce a decision on the mcclain plant acquisition no sooner than the third quarter of og e subsequently withdrew its request before the occ to increase its rates by approximately million annually to cover the costs of the acquisition 
despite the delay at the ferc  an agreement to purchase power from the mcclain plant is enabling og e to honor the customer savings as outlined in the agreed settlement of og e s rate case the settlement agreement 
the company will continue to monitor the ferc s recent shift in policy regarding market power issues around the mcclain plant acquisition to determine the practicability of future power plant purchases in addition to purchased power contracts 
see overview pending acquisition of power plant for a further discussion including a potential million per month rate reduction 
og e also plans to increase its capital expenditures in the foreseeable future for electric system reliability upgrades which is consistent with our commitment to our customer savings and reliability plan outlined in og e s rate case filed with the occ on october  og e currently has contracts with qualified cogeneration facilities and small power production producers qf contracts for the purchase of mws  all of which expire in the next one to five years 
the company will continue reviewing all of the supply alternatives to replace expiring qf contracts that minimize the total cost of generation to our customers 
accordingly  og e will continue to explore opportunities to build or buy power plants in order to serve its native load 
as a result of the high volatility of current natural gas prices and the increase in natural gas prices  og e will also assess the feasibility of constructing additional base load coal fired units 
enogex initiated a program in to improve its financial profile and performance 
since january   enogex has sold assets and received net sales proceeds of approximately million  reduced debt by approximately million or percent  reduced its number of employees by approximately percent  reorganized its operations and restructured its senior management team 
in addition to focusing on growing its earnings  enogex managed its commodity price and earnings volatility exposures and minimized its exposure to keep whole processing arrangements 
enogex s profitability increased significantly in due to the performance improvement plan initiated in while the company believes substantial progress has been achieved  additional opportunities remain 
enogex continues to review its work processes  evaluate the rationalization of assets  negotiate better terms for both new contracts and replacement contracts  manage costs and pursue opportunities for organic growth  all in an effort to further improve its cash flow and net income 
in addition to these ongoing efforts  in enogex began a major upgrade of its information systems that is expected to be substantially completed by the end of the company believes that these upgrades will be a major step towards obtaining the data required to allow it to capture available economic opportunities on its assets  provide improved customer service and enable management to more accurately determine the earnings potential of its various assets and service offerings 
other efforts at enogex during included improvements to its two storage fields 
the repair project at the wetumka storage facility formerly known as greasy creek was designed to mitigate potential gas migration  and the remediation program at the stuart storage facility once completed is intended to prevent water encroachment in the field 
during  approximately million was spent and expensed on the wetumka storage facility project and approximately million in capital expenditures was spent on the stuart storage facility project  the company expects no material future expenditures at the wetumka storage facility and expenditures of less than million for the stuart storage facility 
forward looking statements except for the historical statements contained herein  the matters discussed in the following discussion and analysis  including the discussion in outlook  are forward looking statements that are subject to certain risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
such forward looking statements are intended to be identified in this document by the words anticipate  believe  estimate  expect  intend  objective  plan  possible  potential and similar expressions 
actual results may vary materially 
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include  but are not limited to general economic conditions  including the availability of credit  actions of ratings agencies and their impact on capital expenditures  the company s ability and the ability of its subsidiaries to obtain financing on favorable terms  prices of electricity  natural gas and natural gas liquids  each on a stand alone basis and in relation to each other  business conditions in the energy industry  competitive factors including the extent and timing of the entry of additional competition in the markets served by the company  unusual weather  state and federal legislative and regulatory decisions and initiatives  changes in accounting standards  rules or guidelines  creditworthiness of suppliers  customers  and other contractual parties  completion of the pending acquisition of a power plant  an adverse decision by the occ requiring og e to reduce its rates and the other risk factors listed in the reports filed by the company with the securities and exchange commission 
overview general the following discussion and analysis presents factors which affected the company s consolidated results of operations for the years ended december   and and the company s consolidated financial position at december  and the following information should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
known trends and contingencies of a material nature are discussed to the extent considered relevant 
enogex previously was engaged in the exploration and production of natural gas the e p business 
since january   enogex has sold all of its e p business along with certain gas gathering and processing assets that were owned by enogex through its interest in the nustar joint venture nustar and its interest in belvan corp  belvan limited partnership and todd ranch limited partnership belvan 
as required by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  these dispositions have been reported as discontinued operations for the years ended december   and in the consolidated financial statements 
operating results compared to the company reported net income of approximately million  or per diluted share  and million  or per diluted share  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in net income during as compared to was primarily due to lower impairment charges and higher gross margin on revenues gross margin in all of enogex s businesses and lower interest expenses at the holding company 
these increases were partially offset by lower earnings at og e 
the company s results of operations for the years ended december  and include a loss of approximately million  or per diluted share  and income of approximately million  or per diluted share  respectively  from the discontinued operations discussed above 
see results of operations enogex discontinued operations below for a further discussion 
og e reported net income of approximately million  or per diluted share  and million  or per diluted share  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in net income during as compared to was primarily attributable to lower electric rates as a result of the million electric rate reduction that went into effect in oklahoma on january   weaker weather related demand and higher operating and maintenance expenses partially offset by customer growth in og e s service territory 
enogex s operations  including discontinued operations  reported net income of approximately million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  as compared to a net loss of approximately million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  this improvement during as compared to was primarily attributable to lower impairment charges and higher gross margins in all of enogex s businesses from  among other things  improved management of pipeline system fuel  increased levels of firm transportation revenues  improved processing results and the negotiation of both new contracts and replacement contracts at better terms that resulted in increases in gathering fees and reductions in the purchase price of gas 
also contributing to enogex s improvement were gains from asset sales  lower net interest expense and lower operating and maintenance expenses 
as stated above  enogex s e p business  its interest in nustar and its interest in belvan have been reported as discontinued operations for the years ended december   and in the consolidated financial statements as these assets have been sold 
the company s results of operations for the years ended december  and include a loss of approximately million  or per diluted share  and income of approximately million  or per diluted share  respectively  from the discontinued operations discussed above 
this decrease was attributable to the sale of enogex s e p business  nustar and belvan during and in the first quarter of  higher income tax expense due to tax credits from enogex s e p business not being realized as a result of a tax accounting method change and recording an additional charge related to the sale of nustar during the third quarter of see results of operations enogex discontinued operations below for a further discussion 
the results of the holding company reflect a loss of per diluted share and a loss of per diluted share for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the improvement is primarily due to lower interest charges and a higher income tax benefit partially offset by higher other miscellaneous expenses 
compared to the company reported net income of approximately million  or per share  and million  or per share  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in net income during as compared to was primarily due to impairment losses of per share in the fourth quarter of for enogex and the company 
excluding impairment charges  the company s earnings in would have been per share compared to per share in  when the company reported a per share impairment charge

og e reported net income of approximately million  or per share  and million  or per share  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in net income during as compared to is primarily attributable to lower operating and maintenance expenses  lower interest expenses and increased growth in og e s service territory partially offset by lower levels of natural gas transportation cost recovered  lower recoveries of fuel costs from arkansas customers  loss of revenue resulting from the january ice storm  lower sales to other utilities and power marketers off system sales  milder weather and higher depreciation expense 
enogex s operations  including discontinued operations  reported a net loss of approximately million  or per share  and a loss of million  or per share  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the reduced earnings during as compared to were primarily attributable to impairment losses of per share in the fourth quarter of related to the disposition of natural gas processing plants and compression assets that were no longer needed in enogex s business 
absent impairment charges in and and including discontinued operations  enogex would have earned per share in compared with a loss of per share in this improvement was primarily from the transportation and storage business as a result of additional firm revenues from new long term contracts to merchant electric generation facilities and increased storage revenues 
additionally  better fuel recoveries and lower interest expense contributed to the improvement and were only partially offset by lower volumes in gathering and processing 
as stated above  enogex s e p business  its interest in nustar and its interest in belvan have been reported as discontinued operations for the years ended december   and in the consolidated financial statements as these assets have been sold 
the company s results of operations for the years ended december  and include income of approximately million  or per share  and income of approximately million  or per share  respectively 
the increase was primarily related to a higher gross margin on natural gas liquids sales  an impairment charge recorded in for belvan  net gains on the sale of certain of these assets in  lower depreciation expense and lower operating and maintenance expenses partially offset by a lower gross margin on natural gas sales 
see results of operations enogex discontinued operations below for a further discussion

settlement agreement on october   og e  the occ staff  the oklahoma attorney general and other interested parties agreed to the settlement agreement of og e s rate case 
the administrative law judge subsequently recommended approval of the settlement agreement and on november   the occ signed a rate order containing the provisions of the settlement agreement 
the settlement agreement provides for  among other items i a million annual reduction in the electric rates of og e s oklahoma customers which went into effect january   ii recovery by og e  through rate base  of the capital expenditures associated with the january ice storm  iii og e to acquire new generation of not less than mws to be integrated into og e s generation system  and iv recovery by og e  over three years  of the million in deferred operating costs  associated with the january ice storm  through og e s rider for off system sales 
previously  og e had a sharing mechanism in oklahoma for any off system sales 
the settlement agreement provided that the first million in annual net profits from og e s off system sales will go to og e  the next million in annual net profits from off system sales will go to og e s oklahoma customers  and any net profits of off system sales in excess of these amounts will be credited in each sales year with percent to og e s oklahoma customers and the remaining percent to og e 
if any of the million is not recovered at the end of the three years  the occ will authorize the recovery of any remaining costs 
pending acquisition of power plant as part of the settlement agreement with the occ  og e undertook to acquire new generation of not less than mws 
the acquisition of a percent interest in the mcclain plant would clearly constitute an acquisition of such new generation under the settlement agreement 
og e expects this new generation  including the interim purchase power agreement  will provide savings  over a three year period  in excess of million to its oklahoma customers 
these savings will be derived from i the avoidance of purchase power contracts otherwise needed  ii replacing an above market cogeneration contract with powersmith cogeneration project  lp powersmith when it can be terminated at the end of august  and iii fuel savings associated with operating efficiencies of the new plant 
these savings  while providing real savings to oklahoma customers  are not expected to affect the profitability of og e because og e s rates would not need to be reduced to accomplish these savings 
as indicated in the settlement agreement  og e is required to provide monthly reports  for a period of months after the acquisition  to the occ staff  documenting and providing proof of savings experienced by og e s customers 
in the event og e is unable to demonstrate at least million in savings to its customers during this month period  og e will have an obligation to credit its oklahoma customers any unrealized savings below million as determined at the end of the month period  which shall be no later than december  powersmith has filed an application with the occ seeking to compel og e to continue purchasing power from powersmith s qualified cogeneration facility under the public utility regulatory policy act of purpa at a price that would include an avoided capacity charge equal to the lesser of i the rate currently specified in the power purchase agreement between og e and powersmith or ii the avoided cost of the mcclain plant 
og e does not believe that this matter should be heard at the occ at this time and that the avoided cost requested by powersmith is too high 
in the event powersmith is ultimately successful and og e is required to sign a purchase power agreement  it could negatively affect og e s ability to achieve the targeted million three year customer savings under the existing terms of the settlement agreement 
powersmith and og e have been holding discussions to determine if mutually agreeable terms can be reached for a power contract between the companies providing for capacity payments to the powersmith facility 
in the event og e did not acquire the new generation by december   the settlement agreement requires og e to credit million annually at a rate of of million per month for each month that the new generation is not in place to its oklahoma customers beginning january  and continuing through december  however  if og e purchases the new generation subsequent to january   the credit to oklahoma customers will terminate in the first month that the new generation begins initial operations and any previously credited amounts to oklahoma customers will be deducted in the determination of the million targeted savings 
on august   og e signed an asset purchase agreement to acquire nrg mcclain llc s percent interest in the mcclain plant 
the acquisition of this interest in the mcclain plant would clearly constitute an acquisition of new generation under the settlement agreement 
the purchase price for the interest in the mcclain plant is approximately million  subject to adjustment for prepaid gas and property taxes 
the mcclain plant includes natural gas fired combined cycle combustion turbine units and is located near newcastle  oklahoma in mcclain county  oklahoma 
the mcclain plant began operating in the owner of the remaining percent in the mcclain plant is the oklahoma municipal power authority ompa 
closing is subject to customary conditions including receipt of regulatory approval by the ferc 
the asset purchase agreement  as amended  provides that  unless extended  either party has the right to terminate the contract if the closing does not occur on or before march  because the current owner of the mcclain plant has filed for bankruptcy protection  the acquisition also was subject to approval by the bankruptcy court 
as part of the bankruptcy approval process  nrg mcclain llc s interest in the plant was subject to an auction process and on october   the bankruptcy court approved the sale of nrg mcclain llc s interest in the plant to og e 
several parties have filed interventions at the ferc opposing og e s application under section of the federal power act to acquire nrg mcclain s interest in the power plant or  alternatively  requesting the ferc to delay approving such acquisition 
og e believed that its application met the standards under section set forth by the ferc and that its application would be approved 
on december   the ferc shifted its policy regarding market power issues  raised wholesale market power concerns and ordered a hearing regarding og e s acquisition of the mcclain plant 
the ferc action did not reject og e s request to purchase the mcclain plant  but demonstrated that og e must address certain issues 
on january   og e filed a petition for re hearing of the ferc s december  order which included new mitigation measures that were designed to allow for prompt approval of the transaction 
that request is still pending before the ferc 
og e has no indication whether the ferc will accept those proposed mitigation measures 
on march   og e filed testimony and exhibits with the ferc administrative law judge 
the testimony and exhibits indicate that  if the case proceeds to hearing  the wholesale market power issues that the ferc raised in the december  order may be resolved by the minimal mitigation measures 
assuming the acquisition occurs  og e expects to operate the plant in accordance with a joint ownership and operating agreement with the ompa 
under this agreement  og e would operate the facility  and og e and the ompa would be entitled to the net available output of the plant based on their respective ownership percentages 
all fixed and variable costs  except fuel and gas transportation costs  would be shared in proportion to the respective ownership interests 
fuel and gas transportation costs would be shared based on consumption 
og e expects to utilize its portion of the output  mws  to serve its native load 
as provided in the settlement agreement  pending approval of a request to increase base rates to recover the investment in the plant  og e will have the right to accrue a regulatory asset  for a period not to exceed months subsequent to the acquisition  consisting of the non fuel operation and maintenance expenses  depreciation  cost of debt associated with the investment and ad valorem taxes 
upon approval by the occ of og e s request  all prudently incurred costs accrued through the regulatory asset within the month period will be included in og e s prospective cost of service 
despite the delay at the ferc  an agreement to purchase power from the mcclain plant is enabling og e to honor the customer savings as outlined in the settlement agreement 
on january   og e filed an application with the occ and requested that the occ confirm the steps that og e has taken to comply with the settlement agreement will result in customer savings being delivered beginning january   and that no further rate reduction is necessary 
various parties have intervened opposing og e s request 
if the occ does not agree with og e s request  og e will be required to reduce electric rates to its oklahoma customers by approximately million per month and would expect to reduce expenditures for planned electric system reliability upgrades 
the occ has scheduled a hearing on april  for action in this case 
assuming that og e acquires the mcclain plant  og e expects to fund the acquisition with a combination of a capital contribution from the company  funded in part by the company s equity issuance in  and the issuance of long term debt by og e 
rate case on september   og e filed with the occ a notice of intent to seek an annual increase in its rates to its oklahoma customers of more than one percent 
the notice listed the following  among others  as major issues to be addressed in its application i the acquisition of new generation in accordance with the settlement agreement  ii increased capital expenditures for efficiency improvements and reliability enhancements to ensure fuel costs are minimized  and iii increased pension  medical and insurance costs 
on october   og e filed a request with the occ to increase its rates by approximately million annually 
the increase was intended to pay for its pending acquisition of a percent interest in the mcclain plant  allow for investment in electric system reliability and address rising business costs 
the rate plan would have reduced rates for schools and more than  small businesses and non profit organizations 
on january   og e filed an application to withdraw its request for a million rate increase due to the delay at ferc in receiving the necessary approvals to complete the acquisition of the mcclain plant  which was a significant part of this rate case 
an order dismissing the case was issued by the occ on january  on december   the ferc issued an order setting for hearing og e s proposed acquisition of the mcclain plant and on january   the ferc administrative law judge in charge of the hearing and the parties to the case agreed to a procedural schedule that would produce a decision on the mcclain plant acquisition no sooner than the third quarter of og e expects to file another rate case in the near future to recover increased operating and capital expenditures 
gas transportation and storage agreement as part of the settlement agreement  og e also agreed to consider competitive bidding for gas transportation service to its natural gas fired generation facilities pursuant to the terms set forth in the settlement agreement 
og e believes that in order for it to achieve maximum coal generation and ensure reliable electric service  it must have firm no notice load following service for both gas transportation and gas storage 
this type of service is required to satisfy the daily swings in customer demand placed on og e s system and still permit natural gas units to not impede coal energy production 
og e also believes that gas storage is an integral part of providing gas supply to og e s generation facilities 
accordingly  og e evaluated its competitive bid options in light of these circumstances 
og e s evaluation clearly demonstrates that the enogex integrated gas system provides superior firm no notice load following service to og e that is not available from other companies serving the og e marketplace 
on april   og e filed an application with the occ in which og e advised the occ that  after careful consideration  competitive bidding for gas transportation was rejected in favor of a new intrastate firm no notice load following gas transportation and storage services agreement with enogex 
this seven year agreement provides for gas transportation and storage services for each of og e s natural gas fired generation facilities 
during  og e paid enogex approximately million for gas transportation and storage services 
based upon requests for information from intervenors  og e has requested from enogex and enogex has agreed to retain a cost of service consultant to assist in the preparation of testimony related to this case 
on january   the occ issued a procedural schedule for this case 
a hearing is scheduled august  and an occ order in the case is expected by the end of og e believes the amount currently paid to enogex for no notice load following transportation and storage services is fair  just and reasonable 
if any amounts paid by og e are found not to be recoverable  og e believes such amount would not be material 
security enhancements on april   og e filed a joint application with the occ requesting approval for security investments and a rider to recover these costs from the ratepayers 
on august   og e filed testimony with the occ outlining proposed expenditures and related actions for security enhancement and a proposed recovery rider 
attempting to make security investments at the proper level  og e has developed a set of guidelines intended to minimize long term or widespread outages  minimize the impact on critical national defense and related customers  maximize the ability to respond to and recover from an attack  minimize the financial impact on og e that might be caused by an attack and accomplish these efforts with minimal impact on ratepayers 
the occ staff retained a security expert to review the report filed by og e 
og e currently expects that hearings will be held in early on october   the occ filed a notice of inquiry to consider the issues related to the role of the occ and oklahoma regulated companies in addressing the security of the electrical system infrastructure and key assets 
on march   the occ deliberated the notice of inquiry and directed the occ staff to file a rulemaking proceeding for each utility industry regarding security of the electrical system infrastructure and key assets 
og e has been and will continue to be affected by competitive changes to the utility industry 
significant changes already have occurred and additional changes are being proposed to the wholesale electric market 
although it appears unlikely in the near future that changes will occur to retail regulation in the states served by og e due to the significant problems faced by california in its electric deregulation efforts and other factors  significant changes are possible  which could significantly change the manner in which og e conducts its business 
these developments at the federal and state levels are described in more detail below under electric competition  regulation

enogex enogex manages its operations along three related businesses transportation and storage  gathering and processing  and marketing and trading 
in  these businesses are expected to produce a gross margin of approximately million  down from million in the company expects approximately percent of enogex s gross margin during to be generated from its transportation and storage business as compared to percent in approximately percent of these gross margins are under firm contracts 
revenues in transportation and storage are primarily from gas transportation contracts with utilities in oklahoma and arkansas and independent power producers ipp in oklahoma 
revenues in the transportation and storage business are expected to decrease due to lower recovery of prior under recovered fuel as the company has lowered its fuel rate on the system partially offset by the full year impact of a storage contract 
the company expects its gathering and processing business to contribute approximately percent of enogex s gross margin in as compared to percent in revenues in gathering and processing are expected to increase in primarily due to continued efforts to increase margins from renegotiation of expiring contracts and reduced fuel expense offset by lower forecasted processing margins 
volumes are expected to remain flat from the company has forecasted natural gas prices of approximately per million british thermal unit mmbtu  per gallon average natural gas liquids prices and new well connects in its gathering and processing business 
the company expects its marketing and trading business to contribute approximately eight percent of enogex s gross margin in as compared to nine percent in revenues in marketing and trading are expected to decrease in primarily due to a lack of the change in accounting principle discussed in accounting pronouncements partially offset by increased natural gas marketed volumes 
enogex also expects operating expenses to be flat in as increased operating expenses are offset by the impairment charge of million that was recorded in enogex also expects lower interest expense due to lower levels of long term debt 
key factors affecting enogex s net income will be gathering and processing volumes on the system  natural gas and natural gas liquids prices  commodity prices and the level of system fuel costs

gross margin  which is operating revenues less cost of goods sold  was approximately million in as compared to approximately million in  a decrease of approximately million or percent 
the gross margin primarily decreased due to lower electric rates as a result of the million electric rate reduction that went into effect in oklahoma on january  approximately million 
gross margin also was reduced by approximately million due to weaker weather related demand 
lower off system sales decreased the gross margin by approximately million as off system sales can vary based upon the supply and demand needs on og e s generation system 
partially offsetting these decreases in gross margin was an increase of approximately million due to customer growth in og e s service territory 
cost of goods sold for og e consists of fuel used in electric generation and purchased power 
fuel expense increased approximately million or percent in as compared to primarily due to a percent increase in the average cost of fuel per kilowatt hour kwh 
og e s electric generating capability is fairly evenly divided between coal and natural gas and provides for flexibility to use either fuel to the best economic advantage for og e and its customers 
in  og e s fuel mix was percent coal and percent natural gas 
though og e has a higher installed capability of generation from natural gas units of percent  it has been more economical to generate electricity for our customers with lower priced coal 
purchased power costs increased approximately million or percent in as compared to the increase was primarily due to approximately a percent increase in the volume of energy purchased primarily due to economic purchases 
variances in the actual cost of fuel used in electric generation and certain purchased power costs  as compared to the fuel component included in the cost of service for ratemaking  are passed through to og e s customers through automatic fuel adjustment clauses 
while the regulatory mechanisms for recovering fuel costs differ in oklahoma and arkansas  in both states the costs are passed through to customers and are intended to provide neither an ultimate benefit nor detriment to og e 
the automatic fuel adjustment clauses are subject to periodic review by the occ  the apsc and the ferc 
the occ  the apsc and the ferc have authority to review the appropriateness of gas transportation charges or other fees og e pays to enogex

compared to og e s operating income increased approximately million or percent in as compared to the increase in operating income was primarily attributable to a slightly higher gross margin due to growth in electric usage in og e s service territory and lower operating and maintenance expenses partially offset by lower levels of natural gas transportation cost recovered  lower recoveries of fuel costs from arkansas customers  loss of revenue resulting from the january ice storm  lower off system sales and milder weather 
gross margin was approximately million in as compared to approximately million in  an increase of approximately million or percent 
growth in the number of customers in og e s service territory and the resulting increase in electric sales of approximately percent increased the gross margin by approximately million 
the increase was offset by lower recoveries of fuel costs from arkansas customers through that state s automatic fuel adjustment clause of approximately million 
in arkansas  recovery of fuel costs is subject to a bandwidth mechanism 
if fuel costs are within the bandwidth range  recoveries are not adjusted on a monthly basis  rather they are reset annually on april gross margin also was reduced by approximately million due to milder weather 
lower recoveries under the generation efficiency performance rider gep rider  which terminated in june  decreased the gross margin by approximately million in additionally  lower levels of natural gas transportation cost that og e was allowed to recover from its customers as a result of the acquisition premium credit rider apc rider and the gas transportation adjustment credit rider gtac rider decreased the gross margin by approximately million 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of these riders 
although total expenditures from the january ice storm of approximately million  which have been capitalized or deferred  did not impact operating results  the related loss of revenue due to interruption of service to our customers resulted in a decrease in the gross margin of approximately million in reduced amounts of off system sales decreased the gross margin by approximately million as off system sales can vary based upon the supply and demand needs on og e s generation system 
fuel expense decreased approximately million or percent in as compared to primarily due to an percent decrease in the average cost of fuel per kwh

the balance of fuel clause over recoveries net of fuel clause under recoveries was approximately million at december  the balance of fuel clause under recoveries was approximately million at december  the increase in fuel clause over recoveries was due to over recoveries from og e s customers as the amount billed during exceeded og e s cost of fuel 
the cost of fuel subject to recovery through the fuel clause mechanism was approximately per mmbtu in december  and was approximately per mmbtu in december og e s fuel recovery clauses are designed to smooth the impact of fuel price volatility on customers bills 
as a result  og e under recovers fuel cost in periods of rising prices above the baseline charge for fuel and over recovers fuel cost when prices decline below the baseline charge for fuel 
provisions in the fuel clauses allow og e to amortize under or over recovery 
og e began amortizing the under collected amounts for beginning with the april customers bills 
the balance of prepaid benefit obligation was approximately million and million at december  and  respectively  an increase of approximately million or percent 
the increase was due to the pension plan funding during the third quarter of partially offset by a decrease due to pension accruals being credited to the prepaid benefit obligation 
the balance of short term debt was approximately million and million at december  and  respectively  a decrease of approximately million or percent 
the decrease was primarily due to proceeds received from the sale of the company s common stock in the third quarter of  the sale of the company aircraft in the third quarter of  the sale of ozark and nustar and from the sale of natural gas inventory by enogex during the first quarter of and an income tax refund received in the fourth quarter of  which were used to reduce the commercial paper balance at the holding company 
due to a delay in the completion of the mcclain plant acquisition  in january  the company used short term investments to reduce the commercial paper balance to approximately million at january  the balance of current price risk management liabilities was approximately million and million at december  and  respectively  an increase of approximately million 
the increase was due to significant volatility and higher natural gas prices associated with oeri s trading activities during this increase was offset by an increase in current price risk management assets 
the balance of accrued pension and benefit obligations was approximately million and million at december  and  respectively  a decrease of approximately million or percent 
the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the liability associated with the company s pension plan

capital requirements and financing activities total capital requirements  consisting of capital expenditures  maturities and retirements of long term debt and pension funding obligations  were approximately million and contractual obligations  net of recoveries through automatic fuel adjustment clauses  were approximately million resulting in total net capital requirements and contractual obligations of approximately million in approximately million of the capital requirements were to comply with environmental regulations 
this compares to net capital requirements of approximately million and net contractual obligations of approximately million totaling approximately million in  of which approximately million was to comply with environmental regulations 
approximately million of capital expenditures in were associated with the costs of the january ice storm  which severely damaged og e s electric transmission and distribution systems 
excluding the ice storm  total net capital requirements would have been approximately million 
during  the company s sources of capital were internally generated funds from operating cash flows  short term borrowings  proceeds from the sale of assets  the company s equity issuance in the third quarter and the issuance of common stock pursuant to the drip

interest rate swap agreements at december  and  the company had three outstanding interest rate swap agreements i og e entered into an interest rate swap agreement  effective march   to convert million of percent fixed rate debt due october   to a variable rate based on the three month london interbank offering rate libor and ii enogex entered into two separate interest rate swap agreements  effective july  and october   to convert million of percent fixed rate debt due january   to a variable rate based on the six month libor 
the objective of these interest rate swaps was to achieve a lower cost of debt and to raise the percentage of total corporate long term floating rate debt to reflect a level more in line with industry standards 
these interest rate swaps qualified as fair value hedges under sfas no 
and met all of the requirements for a determination that there was no ineffective portion as allowed by the shortcut method under sfas no 
at december  and  the fair values pursuant to the interest rate swaps were approximately million and million  respectively  and are classified as deferred charges and other assets price risk management in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
a corresponding net increase of approximately million and million was reflected in long term debt at december  and  respectively  as these fair value hedges were effective at december  and on april   the company entered into a one year interest rate swap agreement to lock in a fixed rate of percent  effective april   on million of variable rate short term debt 
the objective of this interest rate swap was to achieve a lower cost of debt and to reduce exposure to short term interest rate volatility associated with the company s commercial paper program 
this interest rate swap initially qualified for hedge accounting treatment as a cash flow hedge under sfas no 
however  due to unexpected changes in the level of commercial paper issued during the third quarter of  hedge accounting treatment under sfas no 
was discontinued as of july   and all subsequent changes in the fair value of the swap were recorded as interest expense 
during and  approximately million and million  respectively  were recorded as interest expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
at december   no amounts were included in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to this cash flow hedge 
as of december   approximately a million after tax loss was included in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to this cash flow hedge 
future capital requirements capital expenditures the company s current to construction program includes the purchase of new generation as discussed below 
og e currently has qf contracts for the purchase of mws  all of which expire in the next one to five years 
the company will continue reviewing all of the supply alternatives to replace expiring qf contracts that minimize the total cost of generation to our customers 
accordingly  og e will continue to explore opportunities to build or buy power plants in order to serve its native load 
as a result of the high volatility of current natural gas prices and the increase in natural gas prices  og e will also assess the feasibility of constructing additional base load coal fired units 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of current proceedings involving a powersmith qf contract 
on august   og e signed an asset purchase agreement to acquire nrg mcclain llc s percent interest in the mw mcclain plant 
closing has been delayed pending receipt of ferc approval 
the purchase price for the interest in the mcclain plant is approximately million  subject to adjustment for prepaid gas and property taxes 
see overview pending acquisition of power plant 
if approval is received  funding for the acquisition is to be provided by proceeds received by the company from its equity offering in the third quarter of  and a debt issuance by og e 
to reliably meet the increased electricity needs of og e s customers during the foreseeable future  og e will continue to invest to maintain the integrity of the delivery system 
approximately million of the company s capital expenditures budgeted for are to comply with environmental laws and regulations 
pension and postretirement benefit plans during  actual asset returns for the company s defined benefit pension plan were positively affected by growth in the equity markets 
approximately percent of the pension plan assets are invested in listed common stocks with the balance invested in corporate debt and us government securities 
for the year ended december   asset returns on the pension plan were approximately percent 
during the same time  corporate bond yields  which are used in determining the discount rate for future pension obligations  have continued to decline 
contributions to the pension plan increased from approximately million in to approximately million in this increase was necessitated by the lower investment returns on assets and lower discount rates used to value the accumulated pension benefit obligations 
during  the company plans to contribute approximately million to the pension plan 
the level of funding is dependent on returns on plan assets and future discount rates 
higher returns on plan assets and increases in discount rates will reduce funding requirements to the plan 
the following table indicates the sensitivity of the pension plans funded status to these variables 
change impact on funded status actual plan asset returns percent million discount rate percent million contributions million million expected long term return on plan assets percent none as discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  in the company made several changes to its pension plan  including the adoption of a cash balance benefit feature for employees hired after january  the cash balance plan may provide lower post employment pension benefits to employees  which could result in less pension expense being recorded 
over the near term  the company s cash requirements for the plan are not expected to be materially different than the requirements existing prior to the plan changes 
however  as the population of employees included in the cash balance plan feature increases  the company s cash requirements should decrease and will be much less sensitive to changes in discount rates 
during and  the company made contributions to the pension plan that exceeded amounts previously recognized as net periodic pension expense and recorded a prepaid benefit obligation at december  and of approximately million and million  respectively 
at december  and  the company s projected pension benefit obligation exceeded the fair value of pension plan assets by approximately million and million  respectively 
as a result of recording a prepaid benefit obligation and having a funded status where the projected benefit obligations exceeded the fair value of plan assets  provisions of sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  required the recognition of an additional minimum liability in the amount of approximately million and million  respectively  at december  and the offset of this entry was an intangible asset and accumulated other comprehensive income  net of a deferred tax asset  therefore  this adjustment did not impact the results of operations in or and did not require a usage of cash and is therefore excluded from the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows 
the amount recorded as an intangible asset equaled the unrecognized prior service cost with the remainder recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income 
the amount in accumulated other comprehensive income represents a net periodic pension cost to be recognized in the consolidated statements of income in future periods 
security ratings on october   fitch ratings fitch reaffirmed the ratings of oge energy corp

the rating outlook is stable 
fitch cited the solid financial position  low business risk and strong cash flows at og e and the higher risk nature of enogex acknowledging that renewed management focus on cost reductions and reducing cash flow volatility across all unregulated business lines should allow for gradual strengthening of enogex s credit profile 
on january   standard poor s ratings services standard poor s lowered the credit ratings of oge energy corp

standard poor s cited the relatively low risk low cost efficient operations of og e and the business and financial profile of enogex  which has higher risk 
standard poor s further cited the rationalization at enogex has resulted in a business risk reduction  but it is not adequate to warrant an improvement in the overall business score 
the company may experience somewhat higher borrowing costs but does not expect the actions by standard poor s to have a significant impact on the company s consolidated financial position  liquidity or results of operations

s short term commercial paper rating was unchanged at p the outlook for oge energy corp 
and og e is stable and enogex is negative 
moody s cited the diminished credit profile of both og e and enogex with og e having competitive generation and stable cash flow but with regulatory risk associated with the acquisition of at least mws of new generation and enogex exposed to the seasonality of its gas processing business although it has reduced its keep whole exposure 
the company may experience somewhat higher borrowing costs but does not expect the actions by moody s to have a significant impact on the company s consolidated financial position  liquidity or results of operations 
as a result of enogex s rating being lowered to baa  oge energy corp 
was required to issue a million guarantee on oeri s behalf for a counterparty 
in december  this guarantee was increased to million 
at december   there is approximately a million outstanding liability balance related to this guarantee 
in the event one or more of the credit ratings were to fall below investment grade  enogex may seek oge energy corp 
guarantees to satisfy its customers in order to avoid disruption of its marketing and trading business 
a security rating is not a recommendation to buy  sell or hold securities 
such rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the credit rating agency and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 
future financing requirements may be dependent  to varying degrees  upon numerous factors such as general economic conditions  abnormal weather  load growth  acquisitions of other businesses  actions by rating agencies  inflation  changes in environmental laws or regulations  rate increases or decreases allowed by regulatory agencies  new legislation and market entry of competing electric power generators 
future sources of financing management expects that internally generated funds  funds received from the equity offering  proceeds from the sales of common stock pursuant to the drip and short term debt will be adequate over the next three years to meet other anticipated capital expenditures  operating needs  payment of dividends and maturities of long term debt 
as discussed below  the company utilizes short term debt to satisfy temporary working capital needs and as an interim source of financing capital expenditures until permanent financing is arranged 
the company issued equity in the third quarter of and issued common stock pursuant to the drip during later in  assuming the acquisition of the mcclain plant is approved by the ferc  og e plans to issue debt to fund the purchase of the mcclain plant and for general corporate purposes and the company plans to issue common stock pursuant to the drip during short term debt short term borrowings generally are used to meet working capital requirements

the company s ability to access the commercial paper market could be adversely impacted by a commercial paper ratings downgrade 
the lines of credit contain rating grids that require annual fees and borrowing rates to increase if the company suffers an adverse ratings impact 
the impact of additional downgrades of the company s rating would result in an increase in the cost of short term borrowings of approximately five to basis points  but would not result in any defaults or accelerations as a result of the rating changes 
see future capital requirements for potential financing needs upon a downgrade by moody s of enogex s long term debt rating 
unlike the company and enogex  og e must obtain regulatory approval from the ferc in order to borrow on a short term basis 
og e has the necessary regulatory approvals to incur up to million in short term borrowings at any one time 
asset sales also contributing to the liquidity of the company have been numerous asset sales by enogex 
since january   completed sales generated net proceeds of approximately million 
sales proceeds generated to date have been used to reduce debt at enogex and commercial paper at the holding company 
the company continues to evaluate opportunities to enhance shareowner returns and achieve long term financial objectives through acquisitions of assets that may complement its existing portfolio 
permanent financing would be required for any such acquisitions 
critical accounting policies and estimates the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements contain information that is pertinent to management s discussion and analysis 
in preparing the consolidated financial statements  management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
changes to these assumptions and estimates could have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements particularly as they relate to pension expense and impairment estimates 
however  the company believes it has taken reasonable but conservative positions  where assumptions and estimates are used  in order to minimize the negative financial impact to the company that could result if actual results vary from the assumptions and estimates 
in management s opinion  the areas of the company where the most significant judgment is exercised is in the valuation of pension plan assumptions  impairment estimates  contingency reserves  accrued removal obligations  regulatory assets and liabilities  unbilled revenue for og e  the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable  the valuation of energy purchase and sale contracts and natural gas storage inventory and fair value and cash flow hedging policies 
the selection  application and disclosure of the following critical accounting estimates have been discussed with the company s audit committee 
consolidated including electric utility and natural gas pipeline segments pension and other postretirement plan expenses and liabilities are determined on an actuarial basis and are affected by the market value of plan assets  estimates of the expected return on plan assets and assumed discount rates 
actual changes in the fair market value of plan assets and differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets could have a material effect on the amount of pension expense ultimately recognized 
the pension plan rate assumptions are shown in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the assumed return on plan assets is based on management s expectation of the long term return on the plan assets portfolio 
the discount rate used to compute the present value of plan liabilities is based generally on rates of high grade corporate bonds with maturities similar to the average period over which benefits will be paid 
see future capital requirements for a further discussion 
the company assesses potential impairments of assets or asset groups when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances require an analysis of the recoverability of an asset or asset group 
for purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment loss  a long lived asset or assets shall be grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
estimates of future cash flows used to test the recoverability of a long lived asset or asset group shall include only the future cash flows cash inflows less associated cash outflows that are directly associated with and that are expected to arise as a direct result of the use and eventual disposition of the asset or asset group 
the fair value of these assets is based on third party evaluations  prices for similar assets  historical data and projected cash flows 
an impairment loss is recognized when the sum of the expected future net cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset 
the amount of any recognized impairment is based on the estimated fair value of the asset subject to impairment compared to the carrying amount of such asset 
enogex expects to continue to evaluate the strategic fit and financial performance of its assets in an effort to ensure a proper economic allocation of resources 
the magnitude and timing of any impairment or gain on the disposition of assets that may be identified as not being strategic have not been determined 
in the normal course of business  the company is confronted with issues or events that may result in a contingent liability 
these generally relate to lawsuits  claims made by third parties  environmental actions or the action of various regulatory agencies 
management consults with counsel and other appropriate experts to assess the claim 
if in management s opinion  the company has incurred a probable loss as set forth by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  an estimate is made of the loss and the appropriate accounting entries are reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development and or the normal operation of a long lived asset 
the scope of sfas no 
includes the company s accrued plant removal costs for generation  transmission  distribution  processing and pipeline assets 
sfas no 
requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of the fair value can be made 
if a reasonable estimate of the fair value cannot be made in the period the asset retirement obligation is incurred  the liability shall be recognized when a reasonable estimate of the fair value can be made 
in connection with the adoption of sfas no 
 the company assessed whether it had a legal obligation within the scope of sfas no 
the company determined that it had a legal obligation to retire certain assets 
as the company currently has no plans to retire any of these assets and the remaining life is indeterminable  an asset retirement obligation was not recognized  however  the company will monitor these assets and record a liability when a reasonable estimate of the fair value can be made 
the company adopted this new standard effective january  and the adoption of this new standard did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations 
og e and enogex engage in cash flow and fair value hedge transactions to manage commodity risk and modify the rate composition of the debt portfolio 
enogex may hedge its forward exposure to manage changes in commodity prices 
anticipated transactions are documented as cash flow hedges pursuant to sfas no 
hedging requirements and are executed based upon management established price targets 
enogex also utilizes fair value hedges under sfas no 
to manage commodity price exposure for natural gas storage inventory 
hedges are evaluated prior to execution with respect to the impact on the volatility of forecasted earnings and are evaluated at least quarterly after execution for the impact on earnings 
og e and enogex have entered into interest rate swap agreements on the debt portfolio to modify the interest rate exposure on fixed rate debt issues 
these interest rate swaps qualify as fair value hedges under sfas no 
the objective of these interest rate swaps was to achieve a lower cost of debt and to raise the percentage of total corporate long term floating rate debt to reflect a level more in line with industry standards 
electric utility segment og e  as a regulated utility  is subject to the accounting principles prescribed by sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation 
sfas no 
provides that certain costs that would otherwise be charged to expense can be deferred as regulatory assets  based on the expected recovery from customers in future rates 
likewise  certain credits that would otherwise reduce expense can be deferred as regulatory liabilities  based on the expected flowback to customers in future rates 
management s expected recovery of deferred costs and flowback of deferred credits generally results from specific decisions by regulators granting such ratemaking treatment 
at december  and  regulatory assets excluding recoverable take or pay gas charges of approximately million and million  respectively  are being amortized and reflected in rates charged to customers over periods of up to years 
recoverable take or pay gas charges are not reflected in rates charged to customers 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion 
at december  and  regulatory liabilities excluding fuel clause over recoveries of approximately million and million  respectively  have been reclassified from accumulated depreciation in accordance with sfas no 
og e initially records certain costs i that are probable of future recovery as a deferred charge until such time as the cost is approved by a regulatory authority  then the cost is reclassified as a regulatory asset  and ii that are probable of future liability as a deferred credit until such time as the amount is approved by a regulatory authority  then the amount is reclassified as a regulatory liability 
og e reads its customers meters and sends bills to its customers throughout each month 
as a result  there is a significant amount of customers electricity consumption that has not been billed at the end of each month 
unbilled revenue is presented in accrued unbilled revenues on the consolidated balance sheets and in operating revenues on the consolidated statements of income based on estimates of usage and prices during the period 
at december   if the estimated usage or price used in the unbilled revenue calculation were to increase or decrease by one percent  this would cause a change in the unbilled revenues recognized of approximately million 
at december  and  accrued unbilled revenues were approximately million and million  respectively 
the estimates that management uses in this calculation could vary from the actual amounts to be paid by customers 
customer balances are generally written off if not collected within six months after the original due date 
the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable is calculated by multiplying the last six months of electric revenue by the provision rate 
the provision rate is based on a month historical average of actual balances written off 
to the extent the historical collection rates are not representative of future collections  there could be an effect on the amount of uncollectible expense recognized 
at december   if the provision rate were to increase or decrease by percent  this would cause a change in the uncollectible expense recognized of approximately million 
the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable is a reduction to accounts receivable on the consolidated balance sheets and is included in other operation and maintenance expense on the consolidated statements of income 
the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable was approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
natural gas pipeline segment operating revenues for transportation  storage  gathering and processing services for enogex are estimated each month based on the prior month s activity  current commodity prices  historical seasonal fluctuations and any known adjustments 
the estimates are reversed in the following month and customers are billed on actual volumes and contracted prices 
gas sales are calculated on current month nominations and contracted prices 
operating revenues associated with the production of natural gas liquids are estimated based on current month estimated production and contracted prices 
these amounts are reversed in the following month and the customers are billed on actual production and contracted prices 
estimated operating revenues are reflected in accounts receivable on the consolidated balance sheets and in operating revenues on the consolidated statements of income 
estimates for gas purchases are based on sales volumes and contracted purchase prices 
estimated gas purchases are included in accounts payable on the consolidated balance sheets and in cost of goods sold on the consolidated statements of income 
oeri s activities include the marketing and trading of natural gas and natural gas liquids 
the vast majority of these contracts expire within three years  which is when the cash aspect of the transactions will be realized 
a substantial portion of these contracts qualify as derivatives under sfas no 
and are marked to market with offsetting gains and losses recorded in earnings 
in nearly all cases  independent market prices are obtained and compared to the values used for this mark to market valuation  and an oversight group outside of the marketing organization monitors all modeling methodologies and assumptions 
the recorded value of the energy contracts may change significantly in the future as the market price for the commodity changes  but the value is still subject to the risk loss limitations provided under the company s risk policies 
the company utilizes a model to estimate the fair value of its energy contracts including derivatives that do not have an independent market price 
at december   unrealized mark to market gains were approximately million  which included approximately million of unrealized mark to market gains that were calculated utilizing models 
at december   a price movement of one percent for prices verified by independent parties and a price movement of five percent on model based prices would result in changes in unrealized mark to market gains of less than million 
energy contracts are presented in price risk management assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and in operating revenues on the consolidated statements of income 
see accounting pronouncements below for a further discussion 
effective january   natural gas storage inventory used in oeri s business activities are accounted for at the lower of cost or market in accordance with the guidance in eitf which resulted in the rescission of eitf issue no 
 accounting for contracts involved in energy trading and risk management activities  as amended 
prior to january   this inventory was accounted for on a fair value accounting basis utilizing a gas index that in management s opinion approximated the current market value of natural gas in that region as of the balance sheet date 
on april   natural gas storage inventory used in oeri s business activities began to be accounted for under sfas no 
in order to minimize risk  oeri enters into contracts or hedging instruments to hedge the fair value of this inventory 
for any contracts that qualify for hedge accounting under sfas no 
 the hedged portion of the inventory is recorded at fair value with an offsetting gain or loss recorded currently in earnings 
ineffectiveness associated with oeri s fair value hedge strategy was not material 
the fair value of the hedging instrument is also recorded on the books of oeri as a price risk management asset or liability with an offsetting gain or loss recorded in current earnings 
at december   oeri had all natural gas inventory hedged with qualified fair value hedges under sfas no 
as part of its recurring business activity  oeri injects and withdraws natural gas under the terms of storage capacity contracts  the amount of natural gas inventory was approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
see accounting pronouncements below for a further discussion 
natural gas storage inventory is presented in fuel inventories on the consolidated balance sheets and in cost of goods sold on the consolidated statements of income 
the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable is established on a case by case basis when the company believes the required payment of specific amounts owed is unlikely to occur 
the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable is a reduction to accounts receivable on the consolidated balance sheets and is included in other operation and maintenance expense on the consolidated statements of income 
the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable for the natural gas pipeline segment was approximately million and million at december  and  respectively

includes the company s accrued plant removal costs for generation  transmission  distribution  processing and pipeline assets 
sfas no 
requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of the fair value can be made 
if a reasonable estimate of the fair value cannot be made in the period the asset retirement obligation is incurred  the liability shall be recognized when a reasonable estimate of the fair value can be made 
asset retirement obligations associated with long lived assets included within the scope of sfas no 
are those for which a legal obligation exists under enacted laws  statutes  written or oral contracts  including obligations arising under the doctrine of promissory estoppel 
the recognition of an asset retirement obligation is capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset 
asset retirement obligations represent future liabilities and  as a result  accretion expense is accrued on this liability until such time as the obligation is satisfied 
adoption of sfas no 
was required for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after june  the company adopted this new standard effective january  and the adoption of this new standard did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in connection with the adoption of sfas no 
 the company assessed whether it had a legal obligation within the scope of sfas no 
the company determined that it had a legal obligation to retire certain assets 
as the company currently has no plans to retire any of these assets and the remaining life is indeterminable  an asset retirement obligation was not recognized  however  the company will monitor these assets and record a liability when a reasonable estimate of the fair value can be made 
sfas no 
also requires that  if the conditions of sfas no 
are met  a regulatory asset or liability should be recorded to recognize differences between asset retirement costs recorded under sfas no 
and legal or other asset retirement costs recognized for ratemaking purposes 
upon the application of sfas no 
 all rate regulated entities that are subject to the statement requirements will be required to quantify the amount of previously accumulated asset retirement costs and reclassify those differences as regulatory assets or liabilities 
at december   approximately million had been previously recovered from ratepayers and recorded as a liability in accumulated depreciation related to estimated asset retirement obligations 
this balance was reclassified as a regulatory liability on the december  consolidated balance sheet 
at december   the regulatory liability for accrued removal obligations  net was approximately million 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit and disposal activities and supersedes eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas no 
requires recognition of a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity when the liability is incurred  as opposed to when the entity commits to an exit plan under eitf sfas no 
also establishes that the liability should initially be measured and recorded at fair value 
adoption of sfas no 
was required for exit and disposal activities initiated after december  the company adopted this new standard effective january  and the adoption of this new standard did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in october  the eitf reached a consensus on certain issues covered in eitf one consensus of eitf requires that all mark to market gains and losses  whether realized or unrealized  on financial derivative contracts as defined in sfas no 
be shown net in the income statement for financial statements issued for periods beginning after december   with reclassification required for prior periods presented 
the company adopted this consensus effective january  and the application of this consensus did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations as this consensus supports the company s historical presentation of financial derivative contracts 
another consensus reached in eitf was to rescind eitf effective for fiscal periods beginning after december  effective october   all new contracts and physical inventories that would have been accounted for under eitf were no longer marked to market through earnings unless the contracts met the definition of a derivative under sfas no 
application of the consensus for energy contracts and inventory that existed on or before october  that remain in effect at the date this consensus was initially applied were recognized as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting changes 
as a result  only energy contracts that meet the definition of a derivative in sfas no 
are carried at fair value 
the company adopted this consensus effective january  resulting in an approximate million pre tax loss million after tax 
the loss  which was accounted for as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle during the first quarter of  was primarily related to natural gas held in storage for trading purposes 
this natural gas held in storage was sold during the first quarter of resulting in an increase in the gross margin on revenues in excess of the cumulative effect loss described above

eib mutual business program no 
mbp 
eib is incorporated in bermuda under the companies act of  as amended 
the company began participating in eib through mbp on november  the company is the sole participant in mbp the company has issued an million standby letter of credit to mbp for the benefit of insuring parts of the company s property and liability insurance programs 
mbp was established to provide million worth of property and liability insurance for the company 
the million letter of credit was issued to provide protection for mbp in case of large insurance claim losses 
at december   there were no drawings against this letter of credit 
this letter of credit renews automatically on an annual basis 
since a letter of credit was issued  the total equity investment at risk of mbp is not sufficient to permit it to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
the company significantly participates in the profits and losses of mbp  has the ability to participate significantly by input to eib through the oge advisory committee as provided by the participation agreement executed by the company and eib  has sole voting rights and has the obligation to absorb expected losses and the right to receive residual returns 
therefore  since the letter of credit was issued to eib on behalf of mbp  mbp is considered a vie as defined in interpretation no 
and the company is the primary beneficiary which resulted in the consolidation of mbp into the company s consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  in april  the fasb issued sfas no

electric competition  regulation state restructuring initiatives oklahoma as previously reported  the electric restructuring act of the act was initially designed to provide retail customers in oklahoma a choice of their electric supplier by july  additional implementing legislation was to be adopted by the oklahoma legislature to address many specific issues associated with the act and with deregulation 
in may  a bill addressing the specific issues of deregulation was passed in the oklahoma state senate and then was defeated in the oklahoma house of representatives 
in may  the oklahoma legislature postponed the scheduled start date for customer choice from july  until at least in addition to postponing the date for customer choice  this legislation called for a nine member task force to further study the issues surrounding deregulation 
the task force includes the governor or his designee  the oklahoma attorney general  the occ chair and several legislative leaders  among others 
in the legislative session  additional legislation was introduced to repeal the act  but the legislative session ended without any further action to repeal the act 
it is unknown at this time whether the act will be repealed 
the company will continue to actively participate in the legislative process and expects to remain a competitive supplier of electricity 
as a result of the failures of california s attempt to deregulate its electricity markets  the enron bankruptcy  and associated impacts on the industry  efforts to restructure the electricity market in oklahoma appear at this time to be delayed indefinitely 
arkansas in april  arkansas passed a law the restructuring law calling for restructuring of the electric utility industry at the retail level 
the restructuring law initially targeted customer choice of electricity providers by january  in february  the restructuring law was amended to delay the start date of customer choice of electric providers in arkansas until october   with the apsc having discretion to further delay implementation to october  in march  the restructuring law was repealed 
as part of the repeal legislation  electric public utilities are permitted to recover transition costs 
og e incurred approximately million in transition costs necessary to carry out its responsibilities associated with efforts to implement retail open access 
on january   the apsc issued an order which authorized og e to recover approximately million in transition costs over an month period beginning february national energy legislation in december the us senate failed to pass a comprehensive energy bill that had long been debated in the senate and the house of representatives 
the bill  as it was proposed  would have been largely beneficial to the company 
it contained provisions that would have minimized the risk of future uneconomic purchased power contracts being forced on the company under purpa as well as providing tax incentives for investment in the electric transmission and natural gas pipeline systems 
the bill also provided favorable provisions for mandatory reliability oversight by the north american electric reliability council with oversight by the ferc as well as the ferc citing authority for electric transmission in disputed areas 
also positive to the company was that the bill did not contain any provisions for mandatory levels of renewable energy which would have had the effect of raising the company s electric rates 
another significant provision of the energy bill was the repeal of the public utility holding company act of which was of minimal impact to the company 
when congress reconvened in january  the debate renewed over the energy bill 
a compromise bill has been proposed in the senate that would keep all of the issues important to the company intact with the exception of the tax provisions 
excluding those provisions would eliminate the incentives for investment in the electric transmission and natural gas pipeline systems 
it is unknown at this time what language will be contained in the final bill or when  or if  the bill is likely to be considered again in the senate and the house of representatives and  when or if  the bill ultimately will be approved 
federal law imposes numerous responsibilities and requirements on og e 
purpa requires electric utilities  such as og e  to purchase power generated in a manufacturing process from a qualified cogeneration facility qf 
generally stated  electric utilities must purchase electric energy and production capacity made available by qf s at a rate reflecting the cost that the purchasing utility can avoid as a result of obtaining energy and production capacity from these sources  rather than generating an equivalent amount of energy itself or purchasing the energy or capacity from other suppliers 
og e has entered into agreements with four such cogenerators 
electric utilities also must furnish electric energy to qf s on a non discriminatory basis at a rate that is just  reasonable and in the public interest and must provide certain types of service which may be requested by qf s to supplement or back up those facilities own generation 
although efforts to increase competition at the state level have been stalled  there have been several initiatives implemented at the federal level to increase competition in the wholesale markets for electricity 
the national energy policy act of energy act  among other things  promoted the development of ipps 
the energy act was followed by ferc order and order  which facilitated third party utilization of the transmission grid for sales of wholesale power 
the energy act  orders and  and other ferc policies and initiatives have significantly increased competition in the wholesale power market 
utilities  including og e  have increased their own in house wholesale marketing efforts and the number of entities with whom they historically traded 
moreover  power marketers became an increasingly important presence in the industry  however their importance has declined following the bankruptcy of enron and the financial troubles of other significant power marketers 
these entities typically arbitrage wholesale price differentials by buying power produced by others in one market and selling it in another 
ipp s also are becoming a more significant sector of the electric utility industry 
in both oklahoma and arkansas  significant additions of new power plants have been announced and  in some cases completed  almost all of it from ipp s 
notwithstanding these developments in the wholesale power market  the ferc recognized that impediments remained to the achievement of fully competitive wholesale markets including i engineering and economic inefficiencies inherent in the current operation and expansion of the transmission grid  and ii continuing opportunities for transmission owners primarily electric utilities to discriminate in the operation of their transmission facilities in favor of their own or affiliated power marketing activities 
in the past  the ferc only encouraged utilities to join and place their transmission systems under the operational control of independent system operators iso 
on december   the ferc issued order  its final rule on regional transmission organizations rto 
order is intended to have the effect of turning the nation s transmission facilities into independently operated common carriers that offer comparable service to all would be users 
although adopting a voluntary approach towards rto formation  the ferc stressed that order does not preclude it from requiring rto participation 
order set out a timetable for every jurisdictional utility including og e to either join in an rto filing  or  alternatively  to submit a filing describing its efforts to join an rto  the reasons for not participating in an rto proposal and any obstacles to participation  and its plans for further work toward participation 
og e is a member of the southwest power pool spp  the regional reliability organization for all or parts of oklahoma  arkansas  kansas  louisiana  new mexico  mississippi  missouri and texas 
og e participated with the spp in the development of regional transmission tariffs and executed an agency agreement with the spp to facilitate interstate transmission operations within this region in in october  the spp filed its application with the ferc to become an rto 
in july  the ferc determined that the spp did not have adequate scope and configuration to be granted rto status 
the spp was encouraged to explore the possibility of joining an rto to be formed in the southeastern region of the united states and then to explore the feasibility of becoming a part of the recently approved rto being established by the midwest independent system operator miso 
the spp and miso entered negotiations during the late summer of to combine the spp and miso and to form a new regional transmission entity that would combine the miso and spp organizations  capture certain synergies that would be available from the combined organization  and allow member companies in the spp certain options with respect to membership in the combined organization 
however  for a variety of reasons  miso and spp terminated their proposed combination in march og e remained a member of the spp while the miso spp combination was pending  and og e participated with the spp and other spp members to evaluate the next steps necessary for compliance with the ferc s order in the meantime  the spp continued to offer open access transmission service in the spp region under the spp open access transmission tariff 
on october   the spp filed an application with the ferc seeking authority to form an rto 
on february   the ferc conditionally approved the spp s application 
the spp must meet certain conditions before it may commence operations as an rto 
termination of the proposed miso spp combination and recent conditional approval of the spp rto application are not expected to significantly impact the company s consolidated financial results 
in october  the ferc issued a notice of proposed rulemaking proposing to adopt new standards of conduct rules applicable to all jurisdictional electric and natural gas transmission providers 
the proposed rules would replace the current rules governing the electric transmission and wholesale electric functions of electric utilities and the rules governing natural gas transportation and wholesale gas supply functions 
the proposed rules would expand the definition of affiliate and further limit communications between transmission functions and supply functions  and could materially increase operating costs of market participants  including og e and enogex 
in april  the ferc staff issued a reaction paper  generally rejecting the comments of parties opposed to the proposed rules 
on november   the ferc issued its new rules regulating the relationship between electric and gas transmission providers and those entities merchant personnel and energy affiliates 
the ferc s final rule requires all transmission providers to be in full compliance with the new rules by june  in february  og e and enogex submitted plans and schedules to take the necessary actions to be in compliance with these new rules and expect that their initial costs to comply with the final rule will not exceed million in the final rule is currently before the ferc on rehearing 
any changes to the final rule on rehearing could affect the anticipated compliance costs 
in july  the ferc issued a notice of proposed rulemaking on standard market design rulemaking for regulated utilities 
if implemented as proposed  the rulemaking will substantially change how wholesale electric markets operate throughout the united states 
the proposed rulemaking expands the ferc s intent to unbundle transmission operations from integrated utilities and ensure robust competition in wholesale markets 
the proposed rule contemplates that all wholesale and retail customers will take transmission service under a single network transmission service tariff 
the rule also contemplates the implementation of a bid based system for buying and selling energy in wholesale markets 
rtos or independent transmission providers will administer the market 
rtos will also be responsible for regional plans that identify opportunities to construct new transmission  generation or demand side programs to reduce transmission constraints and meet regional energy requirements 
finally  the rule envisions the development of regional market monitors responsible for ensuring the individual participants do not exercise unlawful market power 
on april   the ferc issued a white paper  wholesale market platform  in which the ferc indicated that it will change the proposed rule as reflected in the white paper and following additional regional technical conferences 
the ferc committed in the white paper to work with interested parties including state commissions to find solutions that will recognize regional differences within regions subject to the ferc s jurisdiction 
thus far  the ferc has held conferences in boston  omaha  wilmington  tallahassee  phoenix  new york and san francisco 
in october  the ferc issued new rules governing corporate money pools  which include jurisdictional public utility or pipeline subsidiaries of nonregulated parent companies 
the rules require documentation of transactions within such money pools and notification to the ferc if the common equity ratio of the utility falls below percent 
the ferc requires all utilities authorized to sell power at market based rates to file updated market power analyses every three years 
in december  og e filed its updated market power analysis with the ferc 
regulatory assets and liabilities og e  as a regulated utility  is subject to the accounting principles prescribed by sfas no 
sfas no 
provides that certain costs that would otherwise be charged to expense can be deferred as regulatory assets  based on the expected recovery from customers in future rates 
likewise  certain credits that would otherwise reduce expense can be deferred as regulatory liabilities  based on the expected flowback to customers in future rates 
management s expected recovery of deferred costs and flowback of deferred credits generally results from specific decisions by regulators granting such ratemaking treatment 
og e initially records certain costs i that are probable of future recovery as a deferred charge until such time as the cost is approved by a regulatory authority  then the cost is reclassified as a regulatory asset  and ii that are probable of future liability as a deferred credit until such time as the amount is approved by a regulatory authority  then the amount is reclassified as a regulatory liability 
at december  and  og e had regulatory assets of approximately million and million  respectively  and regulatory liabilities of approximately million and million  respectively 
approximately percent of the regulatory assets and liabilities are allocated to og e s electric generation assets and approximately percent of the regulatory assets and liabilities are allocated to og e s electric transmission and distribution assets 
as discussed previously  legislation was enacted in oklahoma and arkansas that was to restructure the electric utility industry in those states 
the arkansas legislation was repealed and implementation of the oklahoma restructuring legislation has been delayed and seems unlikely to proceed during the near future 
yet  if and when implemented this legislation would deregulate og e s electric generation assets and cause the company to discontinue the use of sfas no 
 with respect to its related regulatory balances 
this may result in either full recovery of generation related regulatory assets net of related regulatory liabilities or a non cash  pre tax write off as an extraordinary charge  depending on the transition mechanisms developed by the legislature for the recovery of all or a portion of these net regulatory assets 
the previously enacted oklahoma and arkansas legislation would not affect og e s electric transmission and distribution assets and the company believes that the continued use of sfas no 
with respect to the related regulatory balances is appropriate 
however  if utility regulators in oklahoma and arkansas were to adopt regulatory methodologies in the future that are not based on the cost of service  the continued use of sfas no 
with respect to the regulatory balances related to the electric transmission and distribution assets may no longer be appropriate 
based on a current evaluation of the various factors and conditions that are expected to impact future cost recovery  management believes that its regulatory assets  including those related to generation  are probable of future recovery 
summary the energy act  the actions of the ferc  the restructuring legislation in oklahoma and other factors are intended to increase competition in the electric industry 
og e has taken steps in the past and intends to take appropriate steps in the future to remain a competitive supplier of electricity 
while og e is supportive of competition  it believes that all electric suppliers must be required to compete on a fair and equitable basis and og e is advocating this position vigorously 
commitments and contingencies in the normal course of business  the company is confronted with issues or events that may result in a contingent liability 
these generally relate to lawsuits  claims made by third parties  environmental actions or the action of various regulatory agencies 
management consults with counsel and other appropriate experts to assess the claim 
if in management s opinion  the company has incurred a probable loss as set forth by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  an estimate is made of the loss and the appropriate accounting entries are reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements 
except as set forth below  management  after consultation with legal counsel  does not anticipate that liabilities arising out of currently pending or threatened lawsuits and claims will have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
this assessment of currently pending or threatened lawsuits is subject to change 
natural gas storage facility agreement with central oklahoma oil and gas corp 
in  enogex entered into a storage lease agreement the agreement with central oklahoma oil and gas corp 
coog 
under the agreement  coog agreed to make certain enhancements to the stuart storage facility to increase capacity and deliverability of the facility 
in a dispute arose as to whether the natural gas deliverability for the stuart storage facility was being provided by coog and these issues were submitted to arbitration in october and november in july  the oklahoma district court affirmed the arbitration award and entered judgment against coog and in favor of enogex in the amount of approximately million the judgment 
on july   enogex exercised the asset purchase option provided in the agreement and title to the stuart storage facility was transferred to enogex on october   effective august  the date coog turned over operations of the facility to enogex 
as part of the agreement  the company agreed in to make up to a million secured loan to natural gas storage corporation ngsc  an affiliate of coog the ngsc loan 
since june  ngsc has failed and refused to repay the ngsc loan 
as of december   the amount outstanding under the ngsc loan was approximately million plus accrued interest 
on august   the company received a petition in a legal proceeding filed by coog and ngsc against the company and enogex in texas 
coog and ngsc stated a claim for declaratory judgment asserting  among other things  that ngsc is not obligated to make payments on the ngsc loan based on various theories and  that the company was obligated to demand enogex make the requisite payments to the company  the company is liable to ngsc for failing to demand the requisite payments from enogex  or alternatively  ngsc is entitled to a reduction in the amount it owes to the company  enogex was and is obligated to make the payments to the company until the indebtedness of ngsc to the company is reduced to zero  enogex is not entitled to set off the judgment against the lease payments that it originally owed to coog and now owes to the company  no event of default has occurred  and under the agreement  the only remedy enogex had or has if the stuart storage facility did not perform was to seek a modification of the lease payments based upon coog s expert s analysis of the performance of the stuart storage facility 
coog and ngsc have also stated claims for breach of contract relating to the same allegations in its claim for declaratory relief and include claims for attorneys fees 
the company objected to being sued in texas because the texas court does not have proper jurisdiction over the company 
on september   enogex filed an answer in response to the allegations  asserting  among other things  that the disputed issues have already been properly determined by the arbitration panel and the oklahoma court and  therefore  this action is improper 
on february   enogex sent its arbitration demand to plaintiffs coog and ngsc regarding the issues between plaintiffs and enogex in the texas action  and enogex named its arbitrator 
on february   enogex filed a motion to dismiss  or in the alternative  to abate  stay and compel arbitration in the texas action 
by order dated june   the court granted enogex s request for arbitration and ordered coog ngsc and enogex to arbitration on all issues and claims arising under the agreement and or the asset purchase option  including all issues overlapping with the loan agreement and related documents 
the texas action is stayed in its entirety pending arbitration

natural gas measurement cases grynberg on june   the company was served with plaintiff s complaint  which is a qui tam action under the false claims act in the united states district court  state of oklahoma by plaintiff jack j 
grynberg  as individual relator on behalf of the united states government  alleging i each of the named defendants have improperly or intentionally mismeasured gas both volume and british thermal unit btu content purchased from federal and indian lands which have resulted in the under reporting and underpayment of gas royalties owed to the federal government  ii certain provisions generally found in gas purchase contracts are improper  iii transactions by affiliated companies are not arms length  iv excess processing cost deduction  and v failure to account for production separated out as a result of gas processing 
grynberg seeks the following damages a additional royalties which he claims should have been paid to the federal government  some percentage of which grynberg  as relator  may be entitled to recover  b treble damages  c civil penalties  d an order requiring defendants to measure the way grynberg contends is the better way to do so  and e interest  costs and attorneys fees 
in qui tam actions  the united states government can intervene and take over such actions from the relator 
the department of justice  on behalf of the united states government  has decided not to intervene in this action 
plaintiff has filed over other cases naming over other defendants in various federal courts across the country containing nearly identical allegations 
the multidistrict litigation panel entered its order in late transferring and consolidating for pretrial purposes approximately other similar actions filed in nine other federal courts 
the consolidated cases are now before the united states district court for the district of wyoming 
in october  the court granted the department of justice s motion to dismiss certain of plaintiff s claims and issued an order dismissing plaintiff s valuation claims against all defendants 
various procedural motions have been filed 
discovery is proceeding on limited jurisdiction issues as ordered by the court 
the deposition of relator grynberg began in december  and continued during the company intends to vigorously defend this action

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management the risk management process established by the company is designed to measure both quantitative and qualitative risks in its businesses 
a corporate risk management department  under the direction of a corporate risk oversight management committee  has been established to review these risks on a regular basis 
the company is exposed to market risk in its normal course of business  including changes in certain commodity prices and interest rates 
the company also engages in price risk management activities for both trading and non trading purposes 
to manage the volatility relating to these exposures  the company enters into various derivative transactions pursuant to the company s policies on hedging practices 
derivative positions are monitored using techniques such as mark to market valuation  value at risk and sensitivity analysis 
interest rate risk the company s exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to long term debt obligations and commercial paper 
the company manages its interest rate exposure by limiting its variable rate debt to a certain percentage of total capitalization and by monitoring the effects of market changes in interest rates 
the company may utilize interest rate derivatives to alter interest rate exposure in an attempt to reduce interest rate expense related to existing debt issues 
interest rate derivatives are used solely to modify interest rate exposure and not to modify the overall leverage of the debt portfolio 
at december  and  the company had three outstanding interest rate swap agreements i og e entered into an interest rate swap agreement  effective march   to convert million of percent fixed rate debt due october   to a variable rate based on the three month libor and ii enogex entered into two separate interest rate swap agreements  effective july  and october   to convert million of percent fixed rate debt due january   to a variable rate based on the six month libor 
the objective of these interest rate swaps was to achieve a lower cost of debt and to raise the percentage of total corporate long term floating rate debt to reflect a level more in line with industry standards 
these interest rate swaps qualified as fair value hedges under sfas no 
and met all of the requirements for a determination that there was no ineffective portion as allowed by the shortcut method under sfas no 
at december  and  the fair values pursuant to the interest rate swaps were approximately million and million  respectively  and are classified as deferred charges and other assets price risk management in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
a corresponding net increase of approximately million and million was reflected in long term debt at december  and  respectively  as these fair value hedges were effective at december  and on april   the company entered into a one year interest rate swap agreement to lock in a fixed rate of percent  effective april   on million of variable rate short term debt 
the objective of this interest rate swap was to achieve a lower cost of debt and to reduce exposure to short term interest rate volatility associated with the company s commercial paper program 
this interest rate swap initially qualified for hedge accounting treatment as a cash flow hedge under sfas no 
however  due to unexpected changes in the level of commercial paper issued during the third quarter of  hedge accounting treatment under sfas no 
was discontinued as of july   and all subsequent changes in the fair value of the swap were recorded as interest expense 
during and  approximately million and million  respectively  were recorded as interest expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
at december   no amounts were included in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to this cash flow hedge 
as of december   approximately a million after tax loss was included in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to this cash flow hedge 
the fair value of the company s long term debt is based on quoted market prices and management s estimate of current rates available for similar issues with similar maturities

commodity price risk the market risks inherent in the company s market risk sensitive instruments  positions and anticipated commodity transactions are the potential losses in value arising from adverse changes in the commodity prices to which the company is exposed 
these market risks are broken into trading  which includes transactions that are voluntarily entered into to capture subsequent changes in commodity prices  and non trading  which result from the exposure some of the company s assets have to commodity prices 
the trading activities are conducted throughout the year subject to daily and monthly trading stop loss limits of million 
the daily loss exposure from trading activities is measured primarily using value at risk as well as other quantitative risk measurement techniques and is limited to million 
these limits are designed to mitigate the possibility of trading activities having a material adverse effect on the company s operating income 
the prices of natural gas  natural gas liquids and natural gas liquids processing spreads are subject to fluctuations resulting from changes in supply and demand 
the changes in these prices have a direct effect on the operating income received by the company as compensation for operating some of its assets 
to partially reduce non trading commodity price risk incurred in the company s normal course of business caused by these market fluctuations  the company may hedge  through the utilization of derivatives  the effects these market fluctuations have on the operating income received by the company as compensation for operating these assets 
because the commodities covered by these derivatives are substantially the same commodities that the company buys and sells in the physical market  no special studies other than monitoring the degree of correlation between the derivative and cash markets are deemed necessary 
a sensitivity analysis has been prepared to estimate the trading and non trading commodity price exposure to the market risk of the company s natural gas and natural gas liquids commodity positions 
the company s daily net commodity position consists of natural gas inventories  commodity purchase and sales contracts  financial and commodity derivative instruments and anticipated natural gas processing spreads and fuel recoveries 
the fair value of such position is a summation of the fair values calculated for each commodity by valuing each net position at quoted market prices 
market risk is estimated as the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical percent adverse change in such prices over the next months 
the results of this analysis  which may differ from actual results  are as follows for in millions trading non trading commodity market risk  net
