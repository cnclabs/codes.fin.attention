significant changes to our sprint agreements as a pcs affiliate of sprint  we do not own the licenses to operate our network and instead pay sprint pcs for the use of its licenses 
under our management agreement with sprint pcs and for the period from our inception through october   sprint pcs was entitled to receive of collected revenue from sprint pcs subscribers based in our markets and fees from wireless service providers other than sprint pcs when their subscribers roam into our network 
effective november  and in accordance with the terms of the addendum to the management agreement as discussed in item business sprint pcs agreements  sprint is entitled to receive of billed revenue less current period bad debts from sprint pcs subscribers based in our markets and fees from wireless service providers other than sprint pcs when their subscribers roam into our network 
we are entitled to of revenues collected from the sale of handsets and accessories from our stores and on roaming revenues received when sprint pcs customers from a different territory make a wireless call on our pcs network and outbound non sprint pcs roaming billed to subscribers based in our markets 
we are responsible for building  owning and managing the portion of the pcs network located in our markets under the sprint brand name 
our results of operations are dependent on sprint pcs network and  to a lesser extent  on the networks of other pcs affiliates of sprint 
as a pcs affiliate of sprint  we purchase a full suite of support services from sprint pcs 
we have access to these services during the term of our management agreement unless sprint pcs provides us at least nine months advance notice of its intention to terminate any particular significant service 
if sprint pcs terminates service  our operations may be interrupted or restricted 
in november  we entered into an addendum with sprint pcs that modified several provisions of the management and services agreements that govern our relationship with sprint pcs 
a summary of the key provisions in the addendum are noted below  and a summary of the management and services agreements  as most recently modified by this addendum  is provided in item business sprint pcs agreements 
sprint pcs consolidated several support services relating to billing  customer care  collections  network operations control center monitoring  national platform interconnectivity  voice mail  directory assistance  operator services and roaming clearinghouse services into one back office service referred to as sprint ccpu service 
we have agreed to continue to purchase the sprint ccpu service from sprint pcs for the period november through december and pay a monthly rate of per subscriber 
we expect this reduction in sprint ccpu services to provide an approximate reduction from our cost structure 
beginning in  the monthly rate for the next three years for sprint ccpu service will be based on a to be determined percentage of sprint pcs reported cash cost per user ccpu 
if we and sprint pcs cannot agree to a new rate for any future three year period beyond  we have the option to continue to purchase the sprint ccpu service and have an arbitrator determine the new rate or self provision or procure those services elsewhere 
sprint pcs consolidated several services relating to subscriber activations  credit verification and handset logistics into one service referred to as sprint cpga service 
we have agreed to continue to purchase the sprint cpga service from sprint pcs for the period november through december at a monthly rate of of sprint pcs most recently published cost per gross addition cpga 
beginning in  the monthly percentage rate for the next three years for sprint cpga service will be based on a to be determined percentage of sprint pcs reported cpga 
if we and sprint pcs cannot agree to a new rate for any future three year period beyond  we have the option to continue to purchase the sprint cpga service and have an arbitrator determine the new rate or self provision or procure those services elsewhere 
we earn travel revenues when a sprint pcs subscriber outside our markets travels onto our network 
similarly  we pay sprint pcs when our subscribers use the sprint pcs nationwide network outside our markets 
the sprint pcs travel rate will continue to be per minute of use plus the actual long distance charges incurred through december beginning in  the sprint pcs travel rate will change annually to equal of sprint pcs retail yield from the prior year 
sprint pcs retail yield is defined as sprint pcs average revenue per user for voice services divided by the average minutes of use per month per user 
we also earn travel revenues when a sprint pcs subscriber outside our markets uses pcs vision data services on our network and we pay sprint pcs when our subscribers use such services on the sprint pcs nationwide network outside our markets 
this roaming activity is settled on a per kilobit basis  and was set at per kilobit of use through under the addendum to our management agreement 
beginning in  the rate will be calculated based upon a predetermined formula specified in the management agreement 
we earn reseller revenue when a reseller subscriber uses our pcs network in our markets 
the reseller rate will be per minute of use from november through december beginning in  the sprint pcs reseller rate will change annually to equal of sprint pcs retail yield from the prior year 
sprint pcs retail yield is defined as sprint pcs average revenue per user for voice services divided by the average minutes of use per month per user 
we have the right to be offered through december any future changes that sprint pcs may offer to another sprint pcs affiliate of similar size defined as having at least million covered pops 
if exercised  we must accept all changes to the management and services agreements of the other affiliate 
under certain conditions  we are provided protective rights to decline to implement future program requirement changes that could be imposed by sprint pcs and adversely affect our business 
a program requirement change can generally alter certain operating parameters of our business to coincide with changes that are being made by sprint pcs nationally and could affect our revenues  expenses and or capital expenditures 
in september  we recorded a one time adjustment to reduce operating expenses by approximately million relating to the resolution of more than million of previously disputed charges with sprint pcs for which we had fully reserved the amounts under dispute 
the adjustment reduced cost of service and operations expense by approximately million and we paid sprint pcs approximately million in conjunction with other previously disputed charges in november in addition  in the fourth quarter  we recorded a million adjustment to reduce operating expenses when we transitioned from the collected revenue to the billed revenue method for reconciling amounts due to the company for accounts receivable 
critical accounting policies and estimates we rely on the use of estimates and make assumptions that impact our financial condition and results 
these estimates and assumptions are based on historical results and trends as well as our forecasts as to how these might change in the future 
some of the most critical accounting policies that might materially impact our results include revenue recognition we recognize revenues when services have been rendered or products have been delivered  the price to the buyer is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we account for rebates  discounts and other sales incentives as a reduction to revenue 
service revenues include subscriber revenues  reseller revenues  sprint pcs travel revenues and non sprint pcs roaming revenues 
equipment revenues include sales of handsets and accessories 
subscriber revenues consist of monthly recurring service charges for voice and third generation data g data services and monthly non recurring charges for local  long distance  travel and roaming airtime usage and g data usage in excess of the pre subscribed usage plan received from our subscribers  cancellation and late fee revenues and surcharges  less reductions for billing adjustments and credits 
our revenue recognition policies are consistent with the guidance in emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf  and staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
we recognize service revenue from our subscribers as they use the service 
we pro rate access revenue over the billing period and record airtime usage in excess of the pre subscribed usage plan 
our subscribers pay an activation fee to us when they initiate service 
prior to the adoption of eitf on july   we deferred all activation fee revenue and direct customer activation costs on a straight line basis over the average life of our subscribers  which was estimated to be months 
direct customer activation costs in excess of activation fee revenue were recognized immediately 
for the years ended december   and  we recognized approximately million  million and million  respectively  of activation fee revenue 
we have deferred approximately million and million of activation fee revenue and related costs as of december  and  respectively  to future periods 
we have determined that the sale of wireless services through our direct sales channels with an accompanying handset constitutes a revenue arrangement with multiple deliverables 
upon adoption of eitf  we discontinued deferring non refundable  up front activation fees and associated costs for our direct sales channels 
additionally  direct sales channel activation fees are now included in equipment revenues rather than service revenues in the consolidated statement of operations to the extent that the aggregate activation fee and handset proceeds received from a subscriber do not exceed the fair value of the handset sold 
approximately million of activation fees were included in equipment revenues during the period from july  through december  we record sprint pcs travel revenue on a per minute rate for voice services and on a per kilobit rate for data services when sprint pcs subscribers based outside our markets use our network 
we record non sprint pcs roaming revenue when non sprint pcs subscribers use our network 
during the second quarter of  we initiated the reseller program with virgin mobile 
we record reseller revenue when reseller subscribers use our network 
equipment revenue consists of proceeds from sales of handsets and accessories which are recorded at the time of sale 
revenues from sales of handsets and accessories represent a separate earnings process from service revenues because sales of handsets and accessories do not require customers to subscribe to wireless services 
beginning july   equipment revenue also includes an allocation of the arrangement consideration from activation revenue received as part of revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
we participate in the sprint national and regional distribution programs in which national retailers such as radioshack  best buy and costco sell sprint pcs products and services 
in order to facilitate the sale of sprint pcs products and services  national retailers purchase wireless handsets from sprint for resale and receive compensation from sprint for sprint pcs products and services sold 
for industry competitive reasons  sprint subsidizes the price of these handsets by selling the handsets at a price below cost 
under our sprint pcs agreements  when a national retailer sells a handset purchased from sprint to a subscriber in our markets  we are obligated to reimburse sprint for the handset subsidy 
we do not receive any revenues from sales of handsets and accessories by national retailers 
for a new subscriber activation and a handset upgrade to an existing subscriber  we include these handset subsidy charges in cost of products sold in the consolidated statements of operations 
revenue and cost data provided by sprint pcs we place substantial reliance on the timeliness  accuracy and sufficiency of certain revenue  accounts receivable and cost data provided by sprint which we use in the preparation of our financial statements and financial disclosures 
the data provided by sprint is the primary source for our recognition of service revenue and a significant portion of our selling and marketing and cost of service and operations expenses 
at times  we have been invoiced by sprint for charges that we believed to be contractually incorrect 
we review all charges from sprint and dispute charges if appropriate based upon our interpretation of our agreements with sprint pcs 
when sprint does not timely notify us of charges that we have incurred or when we are invoiced for charges that we believe to be incorrect  we record estimates primarily based on our historical trends and our estimate of the amount which we believe we will remit to sprint after the disputed item or items have been settled 
valuation of accounts receivable and inventories reserve for doubtful accounts estimates are used in determining our allowance for bad debt and are based both on our historical collection experience  current trends and credit policy and on a percentage of our accounts receivables by aging category 
in determining these percentages  we look at historical write offs of our receivables and our history is limited 
we also look at current trends in the credit quality of our customer base and changes in the credit policies 
under the sprint pcs service plans  customers who do not meet certain credit criteria can nevertheless select any plan offered subject to an account spending limit  or asl  to control credit exposure 
account spending limits range from to depending on the credit quality of the customer 
prior to may  all of these customers were required to make a deposit ranging from to that could be credited against future billings 
during the period from may to february  the deposit requirement was eliminated on all credit classes 
we re implemented deposit requirements for all new sub prime subscribers on sprint pcs clear pay program in late february if these estimates are insufficient for any reason  our operating income and available cash would be reduced 
reserve for obsolete excess inventory we record a reserve for obsolete or excess handset and accessories inventory for models and accessories that are no longer manufactured  for defective models and accessories that have been returned by customers and for second generation handsets and accessories 
with the migration to the third generation xrtt network in the third quarter of  we have discontinued purchasing second generation handsets and accessories 
if the estimate of obsolete inventory is understated  our operating income would be reduced 
long lived assets and goodwill effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 
 and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

sfas no 
requires that long lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability is assessed based on the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset  an impairment loss is recognized 
any impairment loss  if indicated  is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill and certain intangible assets resulting from business combinations entered into prior to june  no longer be amortized  but instead be reviewed for recoverability  and that annual tests for impairment of goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives be performed 
sfas no 
also requires interim tests when an event has occurred that more likely than not has reduced the fair value of such assets 
we assess on an annual basis the fair values of the reporting unit housing the goodwill and intangibles and  when necessary  assess on an annual basis for any impairment 
any write offs would result in a charge to earnings and a reduction in equity in the period taken 
as of october   we completed our annual impairment review and determined that no impairment charge was required 
purchase price accounting requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the fair market value of the assets and liabilities purchased 
in our recording of the purchase of via wireless  we engaged a nationally recognized valuation expert to assist us in determining the fair value of these assets and liabilities 
included in the asset valuation for this purchase was the valuation of three intangible assets the via wireless subscriber base  the right to be the exclusive provider of sprint pcs services in the markets in which via wireless operated and the california pcs licenses subsequently sold to voicestream wireless 
intangible assets are amortized over their respective useful life 
if there were a reduction in useful lives  our operating income would be reduced 
for the subscriber base  a useful life of months was assigned effective april  for the period from the date of acquisition august  to march   the subscriber base was amortized using a useful life of months 
as of march   the via wireless subscriber base was fully amortized 
via wireless sprint pcs management agreement will be amortized over its estimated useful life of years 
in april  we acquired the spokane  washington market from sprint pcs 
included in the asset valuation for this purchase was the sprint pcs customer base for this market 
for the subscriber base  a useful life of months was assigned effective april  for the period from the date of acquisition in april to march   the subscriber base was amortized using a useful life of months 
as of december   the spokane market subscriber base was fully amortized 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our taxes in each of the jurisdictions of operation 
this process involves management estimating the actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the consolidated balance sheets 
we then must assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
future taxable income depends on the ability to generate income in excess of allowable deductions 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  an expense is recorded within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to establish a valuation allowance that could materially impact our financial condition and results of operations 
recent accounting pronouncements in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas no 

the statement establishes standards for how certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity must be classified and measured 
sfas no 
requires that a financial instrument that is within its scope be classified as a liability  or an asset in some circumstances 
many of those instruments were previously classified as equity 
this statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june   excluding mandatorily redeemable non controlling interests associated with finite lived subsidiaries  for which the accounting provisions of this statement have been deferred indefinitely pursuant to fasb staff position we have determined that we currently have no instruments within the scope of this statement 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 

sfas no 
amends and clarifies the accounting guidance on derivative instruments including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and hedging activities that fall within the scope of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
also amends certain other existing pronouncements  which will result in more consistent reporting of contracts that are derivatives in their entirety or that contain embedded derivatives that warrant separate accounting 
this statement is effective for contracts entered into or modified after june   with certain exceptions  and for hedging relationships designated after june  we do not have any contracts that are derivatives or that contain embedded derivatives 
in november  the eitf issued eitf issue no 
 accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor eitf 
among other items  eitf requires that consideration received from a vendor be presumed to be a reduction of the cost of the vendor s products or services 
this presumption can be overcome if the consideration can be shown to represent either a payment for assets or services delivered to the vendor or a reimbursement of costs incurred by the reseller to sell the vendor s products 
this treatment is effective for arrangements entered into or modified on or after january  the adoption of eitf did not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in november  the eitf issued eitf eitf addresses how to account for arrangements that may involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services and or rights to use assets 
revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables are required to be divided into separate units of accounting if the deliverables in the arrangement meet certain criteria 
arrangement consideration should be allocated among the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values 
eitf is applicable to agreements entered into in quarters beginning after june  we have determined that the sale of wireless services through our direct sales channels with an accompanying handset constitutes a revenue arrangement with multiple deliverables 
upon adoption of eitf  we discontinued deferring non refundable  up front activation fees and associated costs for our direct sales channels 
additionally  direct sales channel activation fees are now included in equipment revenue rather than service revenue in the consolidated statement of operations to the extent that the aggregate activation fee and handset proceeds received from a subscriber do not exceed the fair value of the handset sold 
we adopted this new pronouncement effective july  on a prospective basis which did not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas no 

this statement requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred and capitalize that amount as part of the book value of the long lived asset 
over time  the liability is accreted to its present value each period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
upon settlement of the liability  an entity either settles the obligation for its recorded amount or incurs a gain or loss upon settlement 
this statement is effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after june  our network is primarily located on leased property and we have certain legal obligations  principally related to our tower leases  which fall within the scope of sfas no 
these legal obligations primarily include certain obligations to remediate leased land on which our tower assets are located 
in addition to our tower leases  we have leases related to switch site  retail and administrative locations subject to the provisions of sfas no 
in  we recorded an initial asset retirement obligation of approximately million  and capitalized the same amount by increasing the carrying cost of the related asset 
additionally  for the year ended december   approximately million of accretion expense was recorded to increase the asset retirement obligation to its present value  and the capitalized costs were depreciated by approximately million 
results of operations we provide certain financial measures that are calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap and adjustments to gaap non gaap to assess our financial performance 
in addition  we use certain non financial terms that are not measures of financial performance under gaap 
terms such as customer additions and churn are terms used in the wireless communications industry 
the non gaap financial measures of average revenue per user  cash cost per user and cost per gross addition reflect standard measures of liquidity  profitability or performance 
the non financial terms and the non gaap measures reflect wireless communications industry conventions and are commonly used by the investment community for comparability purposes 
the non gaap measures included in this report are reconciled below in liquidity and capital resources reconciliation of non gaap financial measures 
analysis of the years ended december  and customer net additions as of december   we provided personal communications services to approximately  customers  an increase of approximately  from december  during  we added  net new subscribers 
the decrease in net subscribers added was primarily attributable to lower sales due to the intense competition from other national wireless telecommunications companies and tighter credit policies implemented in late february churn churn is the monthly rate of customer turnover expressed as the percentage of customers of the beginning customer base that both voluntarily and involuntarily discontinued service during the period 
churn is computed by dividing the number of customers that discontinued service during the month  net of day returns  by the beginning customer base for the period 
churn for the year ended december  was approximately compared to approximately for the year ended december  the decrease in churn was primarily the result of tighter credit policies and the subsequent improvement in the credit quality of the overall customer base resulting in less service being discontinued involuntarily 
at december   the overall mix of our customer base was prime  sub prime with deposits and sub prime without deposits 
at december   the overall mix of our customer base was prime  sub prime with deposits and sub prime without deposits 
we expect involuntary churn to continue to decline at a slower rate with continued improvement in the quality of our customer base  however  voluntary churn is expected to increase due to the availability of wireless number portability in all of our markets starting in may average revenue per user arpu average revenue per user arpu summarizes the average monthly service revenue per customer  excluding roaming and reseller revenue 
arpu is computed by dividing subscriber revenue by the average subscribers for the period 
during the years ended december  and  our arpu was approximately and  respectively 
the decrease in arpu primarily resulted from a decrease in overage charges attributable to a higher mix of customers on larger anytime minutes rate plans and lower cancellation fees resulting from lower customer churn 
we expect arpu to continue to decline marginally as billing for minutes over plan continues to decrease 
this reduction will be partially offset by the continued increase in data revenue 
cash cost per user ccpu cash cost per user summarizes the average monthly cash costs to provide digital wireless mobility communications services per customer 
ccpu is computed by dividing the sum of cost of service and operations and general and administrative expenses by the average subscribers for the period 
during the years ended december  and  our ccpu was approximately and  respectively 
the decrease in ccpu primarily resulted from decreases in network operating  sprint pcs travel and bad debt expense on a per subscriber basis  and an approximate credit per subscriber from a one time adjustment of million relating to the resolution of disputed charges with sprint pcs that was recorded during the third quarter of the decrease in network operating expense reflects the continuing benefits of scale resulting from the increase in the subscriber base  a reduction in interconnection rates  and the resolution of disputed charges with sprint pcs 
the decrease in sprint pcs travel expense was primarily due to the reduction in the reciprocal roaming rate with sprint pcs from per minute during to per minute effective january  the decrease in bad debt expense was primarily attributable to the resolution of disputed charges with sprint pcs  the improvement in the credit quality of our subscriber base  tighter credit policies  the re instatement of deposits in late february and lower amounts of customer write offs 
we expect continued improvement in ccpu as future net additions enable us to spread fixed charges over a larger subscriber base 
cost per gross addition cpga cost per gross addition cpga summarizes the average cost to acquire new customers during the period 
cpga is computed by adding the income statement components of selling and marketing and the cost of products sold  and reducing that amount by the equipment revenue recorded 
the net result of these components is then divided by the gross customers acquired during the period 
cpga was approximately for the year ended december  which is comparable to approximately for the year ended december  we believe that cpga will remain at approximately current levels in the near term due to significant competition coupled with our commitment to quality subscriber additions 
revenues subscriber revenue 
subscriber revenue during the years ended december  and was approximately million and million  respectively 
subscriber revenue consists of monthly recurring service charges for voice and g data usage and monthly non recurring charges for local  long distance  travel and roaming airtime usage and g data usage in excess of the pre subscribed usage plan amount received from our subscribers  cancellation and late fee revenues and surcharges  less reductions for billing adjustments and billing corrections 
our customers charges are dependent on their rate plans  based on the number of minutes and g data usage included in their plans 
these plans generally reflect the terms of national plans offered by sprint pcs 
the increase in subscriber revenue was primarily attributable to the increase in our subscriber base 
reseller revenue 
reseller revenue is generated when a reseller subscriber uses our pcs network 
during the second quarter of  we initiated the reseller program with virgin mobile 
reseller revenue was approximately million and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in the future  we anticipate receiving additional incremental revenue from qwest for customers who use our network under the qwest reseller agreement that sprint announced in the third quarter of sprint pcs travel revenue 
travel revenue is generated on a per minute rate or on a per kilobit rate when a sprint pcs subscriber based outside our markets uses our network 
an additional long distance rate per minute is generated when that customer initiates a call from our network to call outside the local calling area and the long distance rate we receive is based on the actual wholesale transport and terminating calls associated with the originating switch 
for  the travel rate was per minute 
for  sprint pcs reduced the rate to per minute 
the long distance rate per minute for and was approximately per minute and per minute  respectively 
during the year ended december   our network captured approximately million system travel minutes with approximately of those minutes generating long distance charges which resulted in approximately million in travel revenue 
during the year ended december   our network captured approximately million system travel minutes with approximately of those minutes generating long distance charges which resulted in approximately million in travel revenue 
the decrease in sprint pcs travel revenue was primarily due to the decrease in the reciprocal sprint pcs travel rate and long distance rate per minute offset by the increase in travel and long distance minutes of use and g data usage 
non sprint pcs roaming revenue 
non sprint pcs roaming revenue is generated when a non sprint pcs subscriber uses our network 
we earned approximately million in non sprint pcs roaming revenue during the year ended december  compared to approximately million during the year ended december  non sprint pcs roaming minutes increased from million during the year ended december  to million during the year ended december  the increase in roaming minutes represented a million increase in revenue  and the decrease in the average non sprint pcs roaming revenue rate we receive from other carriers represented a million reduction of roaming revenue 
equipment revenue 
equipment revenue is generated from the sale of handsets and accessories and is recorded at the time of sale 
we record and retain of the revenue from sale of handsets and accessories  net of rebates  discounts and other sales incentives  as equipment revenue 
the amounts recorded during the years ended december  and from equipment revenue totaled approximately million and million  respectively 
the increase was primarily due to higher average retail prices for handsets and the allocation of approximately million of activation revenue to equipment revenue based on relative fair values in accordance with eitf  which we adopted on july   offset by a decrease in gross additions 
cost of service and operations network operations expenses 
network operations expenses include radio communications site lease costs  utilities  network control maintenance  network control site leases  engineering personnel  transport facilities and interconnect charges  and totaled approximately million during the year ended december  compared to approximately million during the year ended december  the decrease in network operations expenses was attributable to lower interconnection and telecommunications charges and million of expense reductions related to the resolution of disputed charges with sprint pcs  offset by an increase in radio communications site rent due to an increase in the number of active radio communications sites from at december  to at december  and co location rents of million for the lease of space on towers sold in the fourth quarter of sprint pcs travel expense 
we pay sprint pcs travel fees on a per minute rate or on a per kilobit rate when our customers use the sprint pcs network outside our markets and we incur additional long distance fees when our customers call long distance originating in a sprint pcs or pcs affiliate of sprint territory 
during the year ended december   our customers generated approximately million travel minutes with approximately of those minutes generating long distance charges which resulted in approximately million in travel fees 
during the year ended december   our customers generated approximately million travel minutes with approximately of those minutes generating long distance charges which resulted in approximately million in travel fees 
the increase in travel expense was attributable to the increase in travel and long distance minutes of use and g data usage offset by the decrease in the reciprocal sprint pcs travel rate 
non sprint pcs roaming expense 
we pay roaming fees to other wireless providers when our customers use their network 
during the year ended december   our customers generated approximately million roaming minutes resulting in approximately million in roaming fees 
during the year ended december   our customers generated approximately million roaming minutes resulting in approximately million in roaming fees 
the decrease in roaming expense was attributable to a decrease in the average non sprint pcs roaming revenue rate paid to other carriers partially offset by an increase in minutes 
bad debt expense 
bad debt expense during the years ended december  and was approximately million and million  respectively 
bad debt expense for the year ended december  included a one time credit adjustment of approximately million due to the resolution of disputed charges with sprint pcs and a million reduction in operating expenses related to the transition from the collected revenue to the billed revenue method with sprint for reconciling amounts due to us for accounts receivable 
the remaining decrease in bad debt expense was primarily attributable to the improvement in the credit quality of our customer base  tighter credit policies  lower customer write offs and the re instatement of deposits in late february we expect bad debt expense to approximate of subscriber revenues for and beyond 
operating expenses

our obligations under the credit agreement are secured by all of our assets 
the senior secured credit facility is subject to certain restrictive covenants 
on january   we reached an agreement with our senior lending group to amend the senior secured credit facility to eliminate certain stage one covenants  including minimum subscribers effective as of december   minimum revenues and minimum adjusted cash balances each as defined in the credit agreement  and to modify certain financial covenants and ratios and their applicable measurement periods  including minimum consolidated ebitda beginning in the first quarter of  fixed charge coverage ratio beginning in the first quarter of and interest coverage ratio beginning in the first quarter of each as defined in the credit agreement  and leverage ratios  including consolidated indebtedness to consolidated ebitda beginning in the first quarter of and consolidated senior indebtedness to consolidated ebitda beginning in the first quarter of each as defined in the credit agreement  to reflect the impact of changes in the company s business

management expects cash and cash equivalents  combined with cash flow from operating activities  to be sufficient to meet capital expenditures needs and service debt requirements through december  and into the foreseeable future 
due to a number of factors  including improving operating performance  the amendments to our sprint pcs agreements  the elimination of the montana build out requirement and the qwest reseller arrangement described above  we expect to attain positive cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures for the year and beyond 
while management does not anticipate the need to raise additional capital to meet our operating or capital expenditure requirements in the foreseeable future  our funding status is dependent on a number of factors influencing projections of operating cash flows  including those related to gross new customer additions  customer turnover  revenues  marketing costs  bad debt expense and roaming and reseller revenue 
management believes our financial position will be sufficient to meet the cash requirements of the business including capital expenditures  any operating losses  cash interest and working capital needs

furthermore  the amounts shown in the above table of contractual obligations for the senior notes would be reduced by million and the columns captioned total and thereafter would each contain the amount of million 
analysis of cash flows net cash provided by operating activities was approximately million for the year ended december   as compared to net cash used in operating activities of approximately million for the year ended december  the increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to a lower operating loss  the resolution of million in disputed charges with sprint pcs and the receipt of an million federal income tax refund 
net cash used in operating activities was approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
net cash used in operating activities for the periods was primarily attributable to the operating loss being partly offset by non cash items and cash sourced from working capital 
net cash used in investing activities was approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease of million was primarily due to lower capital expenditures of million for coverage expansion and g upgrades and the receipt of proceeds from the sale of wireless communication tower sites during the fourth quarter of net cash used in investing activities was approximately million for the year ended december  and net cash provided by investing activities was approximately million for the year ended december  for the year ended december   net cash used in investing activities consisted of capital expenditures of approximately million  offset by a reduction in restricted cash of approximately million and cash received from the sale of equipment of approximately million

cash provided by investing activities included million released from restricted cash and million in proceeds from the sale of via wireless california pcs licenses 
net cash used in financing activities was approximately million for the year ended december   as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of approximately million for the year ended december  our debt for debt exchange in february and issuance of series b senior notes resulted in the incurrence of approximately million in financing costs and a million repayment under the senior secured credit facility 
partially offsetting these transactions was the occurrence of a million cash overdraft  which resulted from checks issued but not presented to banks as of december  net cash provided by financing activities was approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
for the year ended december   net cash provided by financing activities consisted primarily of million in funding under the senior secured credit facility  offset by million in capital lease and other long term liabilities payments and million in deferred financing fees in connection with the july amendment to the senior secured credit facility

in addition  we incurred million in deferred financing fees in connection with the increase in our senior secured credit facility related to the via wireless acquisition 
factors that may affect operating results and liquidity in addition to the risk factors included in item business  the following risk factors could materially and adversely affect our future operating results and liquidity and could cause actual events to differ materially from those predicted in forward looking statements related to our business 
we may not be able to sustain our growth or obtain sufficient revenue to achieve and sustain profitability 
if the current trend of slower net customer growth is more rapid than we anticipate  it will lower the expected amount of positive cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures  which in turn will have a negative effect on liquidity and capital resources 
for the year ended december   approximately million of cash flow was provided by operating activities  primarily due to improved operating results and the receipt of an million federal income tax refund 
our business projections reflect continuing growth in our subscriber base and a reduction and eventual elimination of operating losses and negative cash flows as the cash flow generated by the growing subscriber base exceeds costs incurred to acquire new customers 
if we acquire more new customers than we project  the upfront costs to acquire those customers including the handset subsidy  commissions and promotional expenses may result in greater cash used in the near term but provide greater cash flows in later periods 
in addition  if there is a slowdown in new subscriber growth in our markets or the wireless industry generally  we may acquire fewer new customers  which would result in lower cash needs in the near term but provide lower cash flows in later periods 
we place substantial reliance on the timeliness  accuracy and sufficiency of revenue and cost data and information generated by sprint for the compilation of our financial statements and other financial disclosures  including substantial portions of our revenues  expenses and accounts receivable 
as part of our agreements  we outsource several functions to sprint including billing  customer care  national network operations support  inventory logistics support  long distance transport and national retailer sales support 
the data provided by sprint is the primary source for our recognition of service revenue and a significant portion of our selling and marketing and cost of service and operations expenses 
in certain cases  the data is provided at a level of detail that is not adequate for us to verify for accuracy back to the originating source 
we rely on sprint to have designed adequate internal controls with respect to the processes established to provide this data 
because of this reliance  we are dependent on sprint to periodically evaluate the effectiveness of these controls and report any significant deficiencies and weaknesses in the design or operation of these controls that could have a material impact on our financial statements and disclosures 
sprint provides an annual evaluation of these controls to us by engaging its independent auditors to provide a report on controls placed in operation and tests of operating effectiveness for affiliates under guidance provided in statement of auditing standards no 
 or sas there can be no assurance that the sas procedures will identify all weaknesses that might be material to us 
although we are not presently aware of any material errors affecting us  errors that are not reconciled on a timely basis by sprint could cause us to misstate our revenues or expenses and could result in out of period adjustments that may materially adversely affect our financial results and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
additionally  if we or any other pcs affiliate of sprint find significant errors in information provided by sprint which causes a restatement of financial statements or otherwise affects us  investors and the investment community may lose confidence in us 
in late february  ipcs  inc  a pcs affiliate of sprint  filed for bankruptcy protection under chapter of the federal bankruptcy code and concurrently brought an adversarial action against sprint alleging  among other things  that sprint had failed to remit certain amounts owed to ipcs under its agreements with sprint 
should sprint fail to deliver timely  accurate and sufficient information  this could lead to a greater degree of uncertainty in our business and financial planning and may lead to adverse short term decisions 
the failure of sprint to remit future amounts owing to pcs affiliates of sprint  including us  could lead to actions on the part of us or other pcs affiliates of sprint to enforce rights under the sprint agreements and other remedies available under applicable law 
in addition  in july  us unwired inc  a pcs affiliate of sprint  filed suit against sprint alleging violations of the federal racketeering laws  breach of fiduciary duty and fraud arising out of sprint s dealings with the affiliate and its related entities  and in august  horizon pcs  inc and its affiliated entities  a pcs affiliate of sprint  filed for bankruptcy protection under chapter of the federal bankruptcy code and subsequently filed an adversarial action against sprint alleging similar causes of action to those made by us unwired inc the fcc mandated that wireless carriers provide for wireless local number portability  or wlnp  by november  local number portability allows subscribers to keep their wireless phone number when switching to a different service provider 
we anticipate number portability could increase churn  which could lower our revenues 
we may be required to increase subsidies for product upgrades and or reduce pricing to match competitors initiatives and retain customers  which could adversely impact our revenue and profitability and our liquidity 
wlnp had no material impact on our results for the year ended december  our ability to borrow funds under our senior secured credit facility s million revolving line of credit will be restricted unless our cash balance as defined in the credit facility is less than million at the time of borrowing and could be terminated due to our failure to maintain or comply with the restrictive financial and operating covenants contained in the agreement governing the senior secured credit facility as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we presently are in compliance with all financial and operational covenants associated with the senior secured credit facility 
if we are unable to operate our business within the covenants specified in the senior secured credit facility  our ability to obtain future amendments to the covenants in the senior secured credit facility is not guaranteed and our ability to make borrowings under the revolving line of credit required to operate our business could be restricted or terminated 
such a restriction or termination would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity 
if operating company completes the offering of senior notes due described above under recent development  a portion of the net proceeds will be used to repay and terminate the senior secured credit facility  including termination of the million revolving line of credit 
variable interest rates may increase substantially 
at december   we had million outstanding under our senior secured credit facility 
the rate of interest on the facility is presently based on a margin above the london interbank offered rate libor 
our weighted average borrowing rate on variable rate borrowings was for the year ended december  if we do not complete the offering of senior notes due described above under recent development  increases in a market interest rate for our senior secured credit facility substantially above our estimates may result in unanticipated cash interest costs 
we may not be able to access the credit markets for additional capital if the liquidity discussed above is insufficient for the cash needs of our business 
we frequently evaluate options for additional financings to supplement our liquidity position and maintain maximum financial flexibility 
however  if the assumptions used in our projections are incorrect  we may be unable to raise additional capital 
reconciliation of non gaap financial measures we utilize certain financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or gaap  to assess our financial performance 
a non gaap financial measure is defined as a numerical measure of a company s financial performance that a excludes amounts  or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts  that are included in the comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap in the statement of income or statement of cash flows  or b includes amounts  or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts  that are excluded from the comparable measure so calculated and presented 
the non gaap financial measures discussed in results of operations are average revenue per user arpu  cash cost per user ccpu and cost per gross addition cpga 
descriptions of these non gaap financial measures are provided where the particular measures are discussed in results of operations analysis of the years ended december  and  and the following tables reconcile the non gaap financial measures with our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with gaap excluding subscriber data 
year ended december  average revenue per user arpu service revenue    less travel revenue    less roaming revenue    less reseller revenue  subscriber revenue    average subscribers    arpu minor differences from numbers appearing in results of operations may exist due to rounding the numbers in results of operations to the nearest million 
we believe arpu  which calculates the average monthly service revenue per customer  excluding roaming and reseller revenue  is a useful measure to assist in evaluating our past and forecasting our future subscriber revenue 
in addition  it provides a gauge to compare our subscriber revenue to that of other wireless communications providers  although other wireless communications providers may include or exclude certain items from their calculations which may make the comparison less meaningful 
year ended december  cash cost per user ccpu cost of service and operations   add general and administrative expenses   total cash costs    average subscribers    ccpu cost of service and operations included a one time credit adjustment of million relating to the resolution of disputed items with sprint pcs  which resulted in a credit of approximately per user for the year ended december  we believe ccpu  which measures the average monthly cash costs to provide digital wireless mobility communications services per customer  is a useful measure used to compare our cash cost of operations per customer to that of other wireless communications providers  although other wireless communications providers may include or exclude certain items from their calculations which may make the comparison less meaningful 
year ended december  cost per gross addition cpga selling and marketing    add cost of products sold    less equipment revenue    less selling and marketing adjustment  cpga costs    gross additions    cpga the adjustment to selling and marketing expenses for the year ended december  represents selling and marketing costs incurred prior to the launch of a market 
we believe cpga  which measures the average cost to acquire new customers during the period  is a useful measure used to compare our average cost to acquire a new subscriber to that of other wireless communication providers  although other wireless communications providers may include or exclude certain items from their calculations which may make the comparison less meaningful 
inflation we believe that inflation has not had  and will not have  a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
seasonality our business is seasonal because the wireless industry is heavily dependent on fourth quarter results 
among other things  the industry relies on significantly higher customer additions and handset sales in the fourth quarter as compared to the other three fiscal quarters 
the factors contributing to this trend include the increasing use of retail distribution  which is dependent on year end holiday shopping  the timing of new product and service offerings  competitive pricing pressures and aggressive marketing and promotions during the holiday season 
the increased level of activity requires a greater use of our available financial resources during this period 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market prices and rates  including interest rates 
we have not entered into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading  speculative or hedging purposes 
if we complete the offering of senior notes due described under item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations recent development  all of our interest rates will be fixed 
in the normal course of business  our operations are exposed to interest rate risk on our senior secured credit facility and any future financing requirements 
our fixed rate debt consisted primarily of the accreted carrying value of the subordinated notes million at december  and the series b senior notes million at december  
our senior notes also have a fixed interest rate  but because we have followed the provisions of sfas no 
and eitf  we will not recognize any interest expense with respect to the senior notes in future periods 
these provisions require that the carrying value be recorded at the total future cash payments principal and interest 
therefore  these senior notes are carried on our balance sheet as long term liabilities valued at million see note to the consolidated financial statements 
our variable rate debt consisted of borrowings made under the senior secured credit facility million at december  
our primary interest rate risk exposures relates to i the interest rate on long term borrowings  ii our ability to refinance the subordinated notes  the senior notes and the series b senior notes at maturity at market rates  if needed  and iii the impact of interest rate movements on our ability to meet interest expense requirements and financial covenants under our debt instruments 
we may decide  from time to time  to manage the interest rate risk on our outstanding long term debt through the use of fixed and variable rate debt and interest rate swaps 
while we cannot predict our ability to refinance existing debt or the impact interest rate movements will have on our existing debt  we continue to evaluate our interest rate risk on an ongoing basis 
the following table presents the estimated future balances of outstanding long term debt projected at the end of each period and future required annual principal payments for each period then ended based on our projected level of long term indebtedness dollars in thousands years ending december  subordinated notes      fixed interest rate principal repayments senior secured credit facility variable interest rate principal payments      senior notes fixed interest rate principal repayments series b senior notes fixed interest rate principal repayments  the interest rate on the senior secured credit facility equals the london interbank offered rate libor plus a weighted average interest rate of 
libor is assumed to equal for  for  for and for years and a increase decrease in the variable interest rate would result in an approximate million increase decrease in the interest expense 
the senior notes were issued at a discount in february  but we have followed the provisions of sfas no 
and eitf these provisions require that the carrying value be recorded at the total future cash payments principal and interest 
therefore  the notes are carried on our balance sheet as long term liabilities valued at million beginning february   which is the date of the debt for debt exchange offer described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
as a result  no interest expense related to these notes will be recognized in future periods
