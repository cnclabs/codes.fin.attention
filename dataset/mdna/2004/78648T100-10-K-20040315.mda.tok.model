executive summary overview in this discussion  safety refers to safety insurance group  inc and our company  we  us and our refer to safety insurance group  inc and its consolidated subsidiaries 
our subsidiaries consist of safety insurance company safety insurance  thomas black corporation tbc  safety indemnity insurance company  thomas black insurance agency  inc tbia and rbs  inc  tbia s holding company 
as discussed below under the acquisition  safety acquired all of the issued and outstanding stock of tbc on october  the acquisition 
as a result of the acquisition  the capital structure and basis of accounting of our company differ from those of tbc prior to the acquisition 
therefore  the financial data with respect to periods prior to the acquisition predecessor period may not be comparable to data for periods subsequent to the acquisition successor period 
in addition  the november  ipo  the use of those ipo net proceeds  the preferred share exchange  as defined below  and a direct sale of  additional shares of common stock the direct sale have further altered the current capital structure of our company 
we are a leading provider of private passenger automobile insurance in massachusetts 
in addition to private passenger automobile insurance which represented of our direct written premiums in  we offer a portfolio of insurance products  including commercial automobile of direct written premiums  homeowners of direct written premiums  dwelling fire  umbrella and business owner policies 
operating exclusively in massachusetts through our insurance company subsidiaries  safety insurance company and safety indemnity insurance company together referred to as the insurance subsidiaries  we have established strong relationships with independent insurance agents in locations throughout massachusetts 
we have used these relationships and our extensive knowledge of the massachusetts market to become the second largest private passenger automobile insurance carrier in massachusetts  capturing an approximately share of the massachusetts private passenger automobile market in  according to the car cession volume analysis report of march  based on automobile exposures 
these statistics total  for each vehicle insured  the number of months during the year insurance for that vehicle is in effect  to arrive at an aggregate number of car months for each insurer  this aggregate number  divided by  equals the insurer s number of car years  a measure we refer to in this discussion as automobile exposures 
the ipo and related transactions as discussed below  the november  ipo  the use of ipo net proceeds  the preferred share exchange as defined below and the direct sale of  common shares altered our capital structure 
in connection with the company s plan for the sale of our common stock in the ipo  the board of directors of safety the board declared a for common stock split on november  in the form of a stock dividend that became effective immediately after the company filed its amended and restated certificate of incorporation prior to the offering 
in accordance with the provisions of fas  earnings per share  earnings per share presented in the consolidated financial statements of the company have been adjusted retroactively for the stock split 
the holders of our preferred stock agreed to amend the terms of the preferred stock to cause it to automatically convert into common stock upon the closing of the ipo at the ipo price 
based upon the per share ipo price   additional common shares were issued in connection with the preferred share exchange the preferred share exchange upon the close of the ipo 
as of december   the company had  common shares outstanding 
the  common shares outstanding prior to the november  ipo increased to  at the ipo due to the addition of the new  common shares sold at ipo  the  common shares sold as part of the direct sale  and an additional  common shares issued in the preferred share exchange 
on december   the  shares outstanding increased to  common shares outstanding due to the underwriters purchase of an additional  common shares pursuant to their over allotment option exercise 
on june   the board adopted the management omnibus incentive plan the incentive plan 
the incentive plan provides for a variety of awards  including nonqualified stock options  sars and restricted stock awards 
the maximum number of shares of common stock with respect to which awards may be granted under the incentive plan is  the grants made since inception under the incentive plan are as follows effective date number of option granted exercise price per share vesting terms expiration date november   over years  annually november  february   over years  annually february  march   over years  march  august   over years  annually august the exercise price is equal to the ipo price of our stock 
the exercise price is equal to the closing price of our common stock on the grant date 
the board and the compensation committee intend to issue more options under the incentive plan in the future  not to exceed the maximum number of shares that may be granted 
the acquisition on october   safety acquired tbc  the holding company for our insurance and other subsidiaries  from a group of shareholders consisting primarily of tbc s founder and members of his immediate family 
we accounted for the acquisition using the purchase method of accounting  in accordance with the treatment of a business combination under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations 
under purchase accounting i we recorded the assets and liabilities of tbc at their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition  ii we used the excess of acquired net assets over the purchase price to reduce the estimated fair values of all non current  non financial assets  principally equipment and leasehold improvements  and iii we recorded the remaining  excess of the estimated fair value of net assets over purchase price as an extraordinary gain in the consolidated statement of operations for the period october  through december  in accordance with sfas no 
reinsurance we reinsure with other insurance companies a portion of our potential liability under the policies we have underwritten  thereby protecting us against an unexpectedly large loss or a catastrophic occurrence that could produce large losses 
swiss re  our primary reinsurer  maintains an am best rating of a superior 
all of our other reinsurers have an am best rating of a excellent or better  except for lloyd s of london that is rated a also excellent 
we are a participant in commonwealth automobile reinsurers car  a state established body that runs the residual market reinsurance programs for both private passenger and commercial automobile insurance in massachusetts under which premiums  expenses  losses and loss adjustment expenses on ceded business are shared by all insurers writing automobile insurance in massachusetts 
we also participate in the massachusetts property insurance underwriting association in which premiums  expenses  losses and loss adjustment expenses on homeowners business that cannot be placed in the voluntary market are shared by all insurers writing homeowners insurance in massachusetts 
as of december   we had no material amounts recoverable from any reinsurer  excluding the residual markets described above 
massachusetts automobile insurance market we are subject to the extensive regulation of the private passenger automobile insurance industry in massachusetts  which represented of our direct written premiums in owners of registered automobiles are required to maintain minimum automobile insurance coverages 
generally  we are required by law to issue a policy to any applicant who seeks it 
we are also required to participate in a state mandated reinsurance program run by car to which we cede certain unprofitable risks and from which we are allocated a portion of the overall losses 
this program operates at an underwriting deficit 
this deficit is allocated among every massachusetts automobile insurance company  including us  based on a complex formula that takes into consideration a company s voluntary market share  the rate at which it cedes business to car  and the company s utilization of a credit system car has designed to encourage carriers to reduce their use of car 
in addition  based on our market share  we are assigned certain licensed producers by car that have been unable to obtain a voluntary contract with another insurer 
we call these agents exclusive representative producers  or erps 
proposals to materially change certain car rules are under consideration 
in a letter to the massachusetts insurance commissioner the commissioner dated june   the massachusetts attorney general reported that his office has determined that car s current methodology for assigning erps and distributing the car deficit must be changed to produce a fair and equitable market 
the attorney general s letter describes several factors that he believes support his findings and which he believes should be corrected in order to comply with massachusetts law governing car 
the attorney general s letter calls on the commissioner to work with him to address these issues 
the letter has engendered discussion and dialogue among various parties that could result in material changes to car s rules 
in response to the ag s letter and other factors  including a request by the commissioner to interested parties for suggestions on reforming car  sixteen of the nineteen private passenger automobile insurers in massachusetts including safety insurance  representing approximately of the massachusetts private passenger automobile insurance market  has formed the concerned industry committee for the purpose of developing a proposal for reform 
this group has not yet submitted its proposal formally to the commissioner or others in massachusetts government 
it is uncertain whether and to what extent the issues raised by the attorney general will be addressed by car 
we cannot be certain whether any material changes  if adopted by car  would affect our profitability 
each year  the commissioner sets maximum premium rates that may be charged and minimum commissions that must be paid to agents for private passenger automobile insurance 
the commissioner announced on december   a statewide average private passenger automobile insurance rate increase for  as compared to a increase for and no change for the massachusetts attorney general appealed the commissioner s rate decision to the massachusetts supreme judicial court on january  a decision by the court is not expected for several months and we cannot predict whether this appeal will be successful or what effect it may have on our profitability 
during the period from through average rates decreased in four out of eight of those years 
coinciding with the rate decision  the commissioner also approved a decrease to in the commission rate agents receive for selling private passenger automobile insurance  as a percentage of premiums  as compared to a decrease from in to in while state mandated average maximum private passenger automobile insurance rates increased for  our average premium per automobile exposure in the twelve months ended december  increased from the twelve months ended december  by approximately 
this increase was primarily the result of purchases of new automobiles by our insureds 
further  we believe that the continued benefits of our rate pursuit initiative  which validates insured rating classifications and discount eligibility  contributed to the increase in our average premiums received per automobile exposure 
the table below shows average massachusetts mandated private passenger automobile premium rate changes and changes in our average premium per automobile exposure from massachusetts private passenger rate decisions year state mandated average rate change safety change in average premium per automobile exposure source commissioner rate decisions for source safety insurance as of december  insurance ratios the property and casualty insurance industry uses the combined ratio as a measure of underwriting profitability 
the combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred as a percent of net earned premiums plus the expense ratio underwriting expenses  which include acquisition costs  as a percent of net written premiums  if calculated on a statutory accounting basis  or net earned premiums  if calculated on a gaap basis 
the combined ratio reflects only underwriting results  and does not include income from investments or finance income 
underwriting profitability is subject to significant fluctuations due to competition  catastrophic events  economic and social conditions and other factors 
our statutory insurance ratios for the years ended december   and  respectively  are outlined in the following table for the years ended december  safety statutory ratios loss ratio expense ratio combined ratio under gaap  the loss ratio is computed in the same manner as under sap  but the expense ratio is determined by matching underwriting expenses to the period over which net premiums were earned  rather than to the period that net premiums were written 
our gaap insurance ratios for the years ended december   and  respectively  are outlined in the following table for the years ended december  safety gaap ratios loss ratio expense ratio combined ratio statutory accounting principles our results are reported in accordance with gaap  which differ from amounts reported in accordance with sap as prescribed by insurance regulatory authorities 
specifically  under gaap policy acquisition costs such as commissions  premium taxes and other variable costs incurred in connection with writing new and renewal business are capitalized and amortized on a pro rata basis over the period in which the related premiums are earned  rather than expensed as incurred  as required by sap 
certain assets are included in the consolidated balance sheets whereas  under sap  such assets are designated as nonadmitted assets  and charged directly against statutory surplus 
these assets consist primarily of premium receivables that are outstanding over days  federal deferred tax assets in excess of statutory limitations  furniture  equipment  leasehold improvements and prepaid expenses 
amounts related to ceded reinsurance are shown gross as prepaid reinsurance premiums and reinsurance recoverables  rather than netted against unearned premium reserves and loss and loss adjustment expense reserves  respectively  as required by sap 
fixed maturities securities  which are classified as available for sale  are reported at current market values  rather than at amortized cost  or the lower of amortized cost or market  depending on the specific type of security  as required by sap 
equity securities are reported at quoted market values  which may differ from the national association of insurance commissioners naic market values as required by sap 
the differing treatment of income and expense items results in a corresponding difference in federal income tax expense 
changes in deferred income taxes are reflected as an item of income tax benefit or expense  rather than recorded directly to surplus as regards policyholders  as required by sap 
admittance testing may result in a charge to unassigned surplus for non admitted portions of deferred tax assets 
under gaap reporting  a valuation allowance may be recorded against the deferred tax asset and reflected as an expense 
effects of inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our consolidated results of operations  except insofar as inflation may affect interest rates 
critical accounting policies loss and loss adjustment expense reserves significant periods of time can elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss  the reporting to us of that loss and our final payment of that loss 
to recognize liabilities for unpaid losses  we establish reserves as balance sheet liabilities 
our reserves represent estimates of amounts needed to pay reported and unreported losses and the expenses of investigating and paying those losses  or loss adjustment expenses 
every quarter  we review our previously established reserves and adjust them  if necessary 
refer to results of operations losses and loss adjustment expenses for a more detailed discussion 
when a claim is reported  claims personnel establish a case reserve for the estimated amount of the ultimate payment 
the amount of the reserve is primarily based upon an evaluation of the type of claim involved  the circumstances surrounding each claim and the policy provisions relating to the loss 
the estimate reflects the informed judgment of such personnel based on general insurance reserving practices and on the experience and knowledge of the claims person 
during the loss adjustment period  these estimates are revised as deemed necessary by our claims department based on subsequent developments and periodic reviews of the cases 
we also maintain reserves for estimated losses incurred but not yet reported 
incurred but not yet reported reserves are determined in accordance with commonly accepted actuarial reserving techniques on the basis of our historical information and experience 
we review and make adjustments to incurred but not yet reported reserves quarterly 
when reviewing reserves  we analyze historical data and estimate the impact of various loss development factors  such as our historical loss experience and that of the industry  trends in claims frequency and severity  our mix of business  our claims processing procedures  legislative enactments  judicial decisions  legal developments in imposition of damages  and changes and trends in general economic conditions  including the effects of inflation 
a change in any of these factors from the assumption implicit in our estimate can cause our actual loss experience to be better or worse than our reserves  and the difference can be material 
there is no precise method  however  for evaluating the impact of any specific factor on the adequacy of reserves  because the eventual development of reserves is affected by many factors 
establishment of appropriate reserves is an inherently uncertain process  and currently established reserves may not prove adequate in light of subsequent actual experience 
to the extent that reserves are inadequate and are strengthened  the amount of such an increase is treated as a charge to earnings in the period that the deficiency is recognized 
to the extent that reserves are redundant and are released  the amount of the release is a credit to earnings in the period the redundancy is recognized 
we do not discount reserves 
in  we strengthened our prior years reserves by in and  our reserve reviews indicated that our reserves established in prior years were slightly higher than necessary  and so in those years we released  and  respectively  of previously established reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses 
the changes we have recorded in our reserves in the past three years illustrate the uncertainty of estimating reserves 
it is not appropriate to extrapolate future favorable or unfavorable development of reserves from this past experience 
other than temporary impairments we use a systematic methodology to evaluate declines in market values below cost or amortized cost of our investments 
this methodology ensures that we evaluate available evidence concerning any declines in a disciplined manner 
refer to results of operations net realized investment losses for a more detailed discussion 
in our determination of whether a decline in market value below amortized cost is an other than temporary impairment  we consider and evaluate several factors and circumstances including the issuer s overall financial condition  the issuer s credit and financial strength ratings  a weakening of the general market conditions in the industry or geographic region in which the issuer operates  a prolonged period typically six months or longer in which the fair value of an issuer s securities remains below our amortized cost and any other factors that may raise doubt about the issuer s ability to continue as a going concern 
we record other than temporary impairments as a realized loss  which serves to reduce net income and earnings per share 
we record temporary losses as unrealized losses  which do not impact net income and earnings per share but reduce other comprehensive net income 
the risks inherent in our assessment of other than temporary impairments include the risk that market factors may differ from our expectations  or that the credit assessment could change in the near term  resulting in a charge to earnings 
results of operations the table below shows certain of our selected financial results for the years ended december   and for comparative purposes  the predecessor and successor periods have been combined under the caption for the year ended december  successor predecessor for the years ended december  direct written premiums    net written premiums    net earned premiums    investment income    net realized gains losses on investments   finance and other service income    total revenue    losses and loss adjustment expenses    underwriting  operating and related expenses   transaction expenses  other expenses  interest expenses   total expenses    income before taxes   income taxes   net income before extraordinary item and preferred dividends  year ended december  compared to year ended december  direct written premiums 
direct written premiums for the year ended december  increased by  or  to  from  for the comparable period 
the increase occurred primarily in our private passenger automobile line which experienced a increase in average written premium and a increase in written exposures 
in addition  we increased our commercial automobile line average rates by effective december  and had a increase in written exposures  while we increased our homeowners line average rates by effective february   which was partly offset by a decrease in written exposures 
net written premiums 
net written premiums for the year ended december  increased by  or  to  from  for the comparable period 
this was primarily due to an increase in direct written premiums  partly offset by an increase in premiums ceded to car 
net earned premiums 
net earned premiums for the year ended december  increased by  or  to  from  for the comparable period 
this was primarily due to increased rates on private passenger automobile  commercial automobile and homeowners product lines 
investment income 
investment income for the year ended december  decreased to  from  for the comparable period 
average cash and investment securities at amortized cost increased by  or to  for the year ended december  from  for the comparable period 
offsetting the effect of this increase was a decrease in net effective yield on our investment portfolio to from during the same period in due to declining interest rates  as well as a change in management s investment strategy to shorten the portfolio duration  shift to higher rated securities  and increase tax exempt holdings 
our duration decreased to years at december  from years at december  in addition  during the third quarter of  a retrospective adjustment was made which decreased investment income by due to a periodic revaluation of our asset backed securities using revised prepayment assumptions and resulting assumed cash flows associated with the loans underlying these securities 
net realized gains losses on investments 
net realized gains losses on investments for the year ended december  increased to  gain from loss for the comparable period 
this increase was primarily due to the sale of certain securities related to our current investment strategy to shorten portfolio duration as protection against future increases in interest rates 
the gross unrealized appreciation depreciation of investments in fixed maturities securities was as follows december  amortized cost gross unrealized gains gross unrealized losses estimated fair value u 
s treasury securities and obligations of us government agencies obligations of states and political subdivisions   asset backed securities    corporate and other securities    totals     obligations of us government agencies include collateralized mortgage obligations issued  guaranteed and or insured by the following issuers government national mortgage association gnma  federal home loan mortgage corporation fhlmc  and federal national mortgage association fnma 
the total of these fixed maturity securities was  at fair value and  at amortized cost as of december  as such  the asset backed securities presented exclude such issuers already presented under us treasury securities and obligations of us government agencies 
as of december   our portfolio of fixed maturity investments was comprised entirely of investment grade corporate fixed maturities securities  us government and agency securities and asset backed securities ie  all our securities received a rating assigned by moody s investors services  inc of baa or higher  except the few securities not rated by moody s which received s p ratings of aaa aa or higher  as well as a rating assigned by the securities valuation office of the national association of insurance commissioners of or 
the composition of our fixed income security portfolio by moody s rating was as follows december  amount percent us government and government agency fixed income securities  aaa aa  a  baa  total  ratings are assigned by moody s or the equivalent  as discussed above 
such ratings are generally assigned upon the issuance of the securities and are subject to revision on the basis of ongoing evaluations 
ratings in the table are as of the date indicated 
in our determination of other than temporary impairments  we consider several factors and circumstances including the issuer s overall financial condition  the issuer s credit and financial strength ratings  a weakening of the general market conditions in the industry or geographic region in which the issuer operates  a prolonged period typically six months or longer in which the fair value of an issuer s securities remains below our amortized cost and any other factors that may raise doubt about the issuer s ability to continue as a going concern 
other than temporary impairments are recorded as a realized loss  which serves to reduce net income and earnings per share 
temporary losses are recorded as unrealized losses  which do not impact net income and earnings per share but reduce other comprehensive net income 
the risks inherent in the assessment of other than temporary impairments include the risk that market factors may differ from our expectations  we may decide to subsequently sell a security for unforeseen business needs  or the credit assessment could change in the near term  resulting in a charge to earnings 
the following table illustrates the gross unrealized losses included in the company s investment portfolio and the fair value of those securities  aggregated by investment category

therefore  these decreases in values are viewed as being temporary as we have the intent and ability to retain such investments for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery in market value 
of the  gross unrealized losses as of december    relates to fixed maturity obligations of states and political subdivisions and us government agencies 
the remaining of gross unrealized losses relates to holdings of investment grade asset backed  corporate and other fixed maturities securities 
gross unrealized losses increased to  at december  from at december  during the last half of and  there were no significant deteriorations in the credit quality of any of our holdings and no other than temporary impairment charges were recorded related to our portfolio of investment securities 
however  during the first quarter of there was a significant deterioration in the credit quality of one of our holdings  continental airlines 
accordingly  during the first quarter of we recorded an other than temporary impairment of for this security 
during may  this security was sold at a realized gain of in comparison  during the second quarter of there was a significant deterioration in the credit quality of two of our holdings in the telecommunications sector 
we recognized a realized loss of  for one of these securities  which was sold in june in addition  we recorded an other than temporary impairment charge of  for the other telecommunications security 
during september  this security was sold at a realized loss of finance and other services income 
finance and other services income includes revenues from premium installment charges  which we recognize when earned  and other miscellaneous income and fees 
finance and other services income for the year ended december  increased by  or  to  from  for the comparable period

underwriting  operating and related expense for the year ended december  increased by  or  to  from  for the comparable period 
massachusetts law requires that we participate in the massachusetts insurers insolvency fund  which pays claims up to of a policyholder of an insolvent insurer if the claim existed prior to the declaration of insolvency or arose within sixty days after the declaration of insolvency 
we account for allocations from the massachusetts insurers insolvency fund as underwriting expenses 
underwriting expenses in and included  and  of charges representing our allocation from the massachusetts insurers insolvency fund

regulatory matters 
our insurance subsidiaries are subject to various regulatory restrictions that limit the maximum amount of dividends available to be paid to their parent without prior approval of the doi 
massachusetts statute limits the dividends an insurer may pay in any twelve month period  without the prior permission of the commissioner  to the greater of i of the insurer s surplus as of the preceding december or ii the insurer s net income for the twelve month period ending the preceding december  in each case determined in accordance with statutory accounting practices 
our insurance company subsidiaries may not declare an extraordinary dividend defined as any dividend or distribution that  together with other distributions made within the preceding twelve months  exceeds the limits established by massachusetts statute until thirty days after the commissioner has received notice of the intended dividend and has not objected 
as historically administered by the commissioner  this provision requires the commissioner s prior approval of an extraordinary dividend 
under massachusetts law an insurer may pay cash dividends only from its unassigned funds  also known as earned surplus  and the insurer s remaining surplus must be both reasonable in relation to its outstanding liabilities and adequate to its financial needs 
at year end  the statutory surplus of safety insurance was  and its net income for was  a maximum of  is available in for such dividends without prior approval of the commissioner 
during the year ended december   safety insurance declared dividends to tbc in the amount of  the maximum dividend permitted by law is not indicative of an insurer s actual ability to pay dividends  which may be constrained by business and regulatory considerations  such as the impact of dividends on surplus  which could affect an insurer s ratings or competitive position  the amount of premiums that can be written and the ability to pay future dividends 
on both february  and november   our board approved a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock of per share  or  based on  common shares outstanding  paid on march  and december  to shareholders of record on march  and december   respectively 
on august   our board approved an increase in our quarterly cash dividend from per share to per share  or  based on  common shares outstanding  paid on september  to shareholders of record on september  on both may and february   our board approved a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock of per share  or  based on  common shares outstanding  paid on june and march  to shareholders of record on june and march   respectively 
we plan to continue to declare and pay quarterly cash dividends in  depending on our financial position and the regularity of our cash flows 
management believes that the current level of cash flow from operations provides us with sufficient liquidity to meet our operating needs over the next months 
we expect to be able to continue to meet our operating needs after the next months from internally generated funds 
since our ability to meet our obligations in the long term beyond such month period is dependent upon such factors as market changes  insurance regulatory changes and economic conditions  no assurance can be given that the available net cash flow will be sufficient to meet our operating needs 
we expect that we would need to borrow or issue capital stock if we needed additional funds  for example  to pay for an acquisition or a significant expansion of our operations 
there can be no assurance that sufficient funds for any of the foregoing purposes would be available to us at such time

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk 
market risk is the risk that we will incur losses due to adverse changes in market rates and prices 
we have exposure to market risk through our investment activities and our financing activities 
our primary market risk exposure is to changes in interest rates 
we use both fixed and variable rate debt as sources of financing 
we have not entered  and do not plan to enter  into any derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rate risk 
interest rate risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in interest rates 
our exposure to interest rate changes primarily results from our significant holdings of fixed rate investments and from our financing activities 
our fixed maturity investments include us and foreign government bonds  securities issued by government agencies  obligations of state and local governments and governmental authorities  corporate bonds and asset backed securities  most of which are exposed to changes in prevailing interest rates 
we manage our exposure to risks associated with interest rate fluctuations through active review of our investment portfolio by our management and board and consultation with third party financial advisors 
as a general matter  we do not attempt to match the durations of our assets with the durations of our liabilities  and the majority of our liabilities are short tail 
our goal is to maximize the total after tax return on all of our investments 
an important strategy that we employ to achieve this goal is to try to hold enough in cash and short term investments in order to avoid liquidating longer term investments to pay claims 
the following tables show the interest rate sensitivity of our financial instruments measured in terms of fair value which is equal to the carrying value for all our securities 
fair value as of december  basis point change as of basis point change bonds and preferred stocks    cash and cash equivalents    total    fair value as of december  basis point change as of basis point change bonds and preferred stocks    cash and cash equivalents    total    an important market risk for all of our outstanding long term debt is interest rate risk 
we continue to monitor the interest rate environment and to evaluate refinancing opportunities as maturity dates approach 
with respect to floating rate debt  we are also exposed to the effects of changes in prevailing interest rates 
at december  we had  of debt outstanding under our new credit facility at a variable rate of 
a change in the prevailing interest rate on our variable rate debt would result in interest expense fluctuating approximately for  assuming that all of such debt is outstanding for the entire year 
equity risk 
equity risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in equity prices 
in the past  our exposure to changes in equity prices primarily resulted from our holdings of common stocks  mutual funds and other equities 
while we have in the past held common equity securities in our investment portfolio  presently we hold none 
we continuously evaluate market conditions and we expect in the future to purchase equity securities 
we principally managed equity price risk through industry and issuer diversification and asset allocation techniques
