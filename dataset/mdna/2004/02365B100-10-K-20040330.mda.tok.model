item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk factors 
item business overview america online latin america  inc we  us  aola or the company is a leading interactive service provider in latin america 
our goal is to be a leader in the development of the global interactive medium that is changing the way people communicate  stay informed  are entertained  learn  shop and conduct business in latin america 
we derive our revenues principally from member subscriptions to our aola country services  the aol branded service in puerto rico and our web based interactive services 
we also generate additional revenues from advertising and other revenue sources 
other revenue sources include programming services provided to america online for its latino content area and revenue sharing agreements with certain local telecommunications providers 
our aola country services and web based interactive services provide our members with easy and reliable access to online communities  content and localized versions of certain of america online  inc s america online interactive products 
our services enable members to access and explore the internet and encourage members to participate in interactive communities through tools such as spanish and portuguese versions of aol instant messenger  buddy lists  e mail  web logs  public bulletin boards  online meeting rooms  conversations  chat and auditorium events 
our aola country services require members to use a software client program on their computers  whereas our web based services do not require this software 
members can personalize their online experience through a variety of features  including customized news and e mail controls 
our interactive services also provide members with local and regional content organized into channels  making areas of interest easy to find  and our aola country services also provide access to the extensive global content of the aol service 
our markets in latin america are brazil  mexico  argentina and puerto rico 
we have no current plans to expand to other markets in latin america 
in the table below  with respect to each market  we provide the date on which we first launched our country service in each market and our market coverage as of february market commencement date service coverage brazil november available in cites mexico july available in cites argentina august available in cites puerto rico december available island wide under an agreement with america online  we receive the economic benefit associated with subscribers to the aol branded service in puerto rico and include these subscribers in our member totals 
subscribers in puerto rico are provided with both english and spanish language content through the aol branded service 
we launched our new web based content and connectivity services in brazil  argentina and puerto rico in september  october and february  respectively 
our web based services are priced at lower rates than our country services 
we expect these new services to better allow us to compete on the basis of price in all of our markets and  in brazil  to allow consumers to choose the features they need 
we believe our new web based services in brazil and argentina will become our primary products in those countries  although at present the majority of our members in those countries are using the aola country service 
we are no longer actively promoting the aola country service in brazil and argentina  although they are still available 
we expect to experience migration of membership from our aol brazil and aol 
table of contents argentina country services to our new web based services 
to date  approximately of subscribers to our web based services in brazil and argentina have migrated from our aola country services 
we offer our web based service in puerto rico  which we market as conexis  but we do not expect it to become our primary product offering 
we expect to experience migration from the aol branded service in puerto rico to our web based service 
we began testing a web based service in mexico in september  and our decision on whether or not to launch this service in mexico will depend on these test results 
we would not expect a web based service in mexico to become our primary product offering in that country 
in june  we entered into a ten year strategic alliance with banco ita  one of the largest banks in latin america 
banco ita is obligated to market and promote a co branded version of our interactive services in brazil as the principal means of accessing banco ita s interactive financial services 
we also market a version of our web based interactive services in banco ita branches containing the same co branded features as our country service 
banco ita customers who become subscribers to the co branded service are currently entitled to a discount off the standard price for the unlimited  bundled service plan 
in january  we entered into an agreement with mcdonald s in brazil to market our service via kiosks in hundreds of mcdonald s restaurants in brazil 
as part of the agreement  we paid mcdonald s an initial fee of approximately million and are required to pay an annual fee over the five year term of the agreement  which together with the initial fee will in the aggregate total as much as million 
in addition  we also are required to pay mcdonald s a fee for each new member who becomes a paying member of our aola country service in brazil through this agreement 
we launched the project in a limited number of restaurants in october  but the implementation of this agreement has been subject to a number of delays and still has not been fully implemented 
we recently modified our agreement with mcdonald s under which  among other things  mcdonald s is required to hire  train and deploy in the restaurant kiosks  for a period of one year  at its cost  promoters who will be exclusively dedicated to the project 
we also have the right for aol brazil to be promoted in two of mcdonald s national advertising campaigns in and two additional such campaigns in as part of the restructured agreement  we are no longer required to pay a maintenance fee to mcdonald s related to the first year of the contract estimated to have been million  and mcdonald s is no longer required to pay us penalties for their failure in the first year of the contract to establish kiosks on a timely basis according to the implementation schedule included in the initial contract estimated to have been up to million 
as part of the restructured agreement  mcdonald s is required to establish  by august   functioning kiosks in of its restaurants 
to the extent that mcdonald s does not meet this target date  they will be obligated to refund to us a portion of our million initial investment 
the initiative is presently operating in only a limited number of restaurants and we hope to achieve full implementation by the first quarter of failure to successfully implement this agreement would negatively impact our future membership levels 
please see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview  for additional discussion regarding our relationship with mcdonald s 
we consider countries in which we have launched our aola country services or web based interactive services as operational segments and internally report our operations on a country by country basis 
although amounts for argentina are not currently material and are not expected to be material in future reporting periods  we have decided not to consolidate argentina with our corporate and other segment in order to facilitate historical segment comparisons 
each of our operating segments  except for puerto rico  derives its subscription revenues through the provision of interactive services and also from advertising and other revenue sources 
in puerto rico  we derive our subscription revenue from our arrangement with america online whereby america online transfers it net economic interests from members to the aol branded service in puerto rico to us 
our puerto rico segment also derives revenue from advertising and other revenue

our web based and broadband services 
our web based internet connectivity service in brazil is segmented to address four broad categories aol total  which provides content and email services seven addresses similar to our current aol country services  aol executive  which focuses on news and sports relevant to adults and provides three email addresses  aol youth  which provides content and services of interest to the youth segment and provides three email addresses  and aol lite  which provides basic internet connectivity  one email address  and minimal content 
unlike brazil  in puerto rico and argentina  we offer only one web based product 
conexis is the name of the web based service we offer in puerto rico  which provides basic internet connectivity  one email address  and minimal content 
in argentina  our web based product offering is full featured and similar to aol total in brazil 
we launched our broadband service in brazil  aol maxx  nationally in august our new broadband service is a full featured product offering subscribers faster internet access through dsl and cable and unique content designed for delivery through high speed channels 
the pricing of our broadband service in brazil varies depending upon our telecommunications partner 
the gross margin contribution on our broadband product offerings is expected to be similar to that of our aola brazil country service as the business becomes established 
we are also testing broadband products in mexico and argentina  although at present we do not have plans to launch nationally in these countries 
a decision on whether or not to launch our broadband service in mexico and argentina will depend on the test results 
service plans  pricing and collection mechanisms 
service plans are priced according to usage and the level of member services support selected by the member

member services support  if requested by the member  is billed at a flat rate per service call or based on the duration of the call to the call center 
most new members are selecting unbundled plans  which do not provide free call center support

prepayment plans are offered for six and twelve month periods 
additional discounts are offered for payments via credit cards 
the price of all brazil service plans includes an amount equivalent to the icms imposto sobre circula o de mercadorias e servi os tax levied on telecommunications services in brazil and paid to local tax authorities 
to date  the majority of our subscribers in brazil have chosen unlimited service price plans 
the argentina service plans described above are also offered at discounts to monthly billing rates for members who prepay their aol service

additionally  discounts are offered for payments via credit cards for any price plan 
in puerto rico  pricing for our aol branded service is based on service plans offered by america online in the united states 
all service plans offered are bundled  and therefore include unlimited call center support 
we also offer bring your own access  which refers to usage of the aol branded service through a third party internet provider 
prepaid plans offering additional discounts are also available in puerto rico 
we make our interactive services accessible to a broader audience of potential subscribers by offering multiple mechanisms through which our members can pay us  including credit cards  direct debits from bank accounts and cash payment methods including boletos 
cash payment methods historically have accounted for a substantial majority of all new member registrations in brazil  mexico and argentina 
cash payment methods are not available in puerto rico 
however  the percentage of new registrations selecting cash payment alternatives has been declining in line with our efforts to improve the quality of our 
table of contents membership base 
the percentages of members selecting cash payment mechanisms  by country and in total  as of december  and  are shown in the following table subscribers selecting cash payment mechanisms puerto total brazil mexico argentina rico company as of december  as of december  although we have not experienced any significant difficulties collecting subscription fees from members using credit cards and direct debit mechanisms  collection rates from members opting for the cash payment mechanisms historically have been lower and less timely 
as a result  we continue to encourage conversion of these subscribers to non cash payment options and terminate members who do not pay on a timely basis 
in mexico we have encouraged the sale of long term prepaid plans  which now account for of current aol mexico members  and eliminated free trial periods for members choosing the cash payment options 
in brazil and argentina  we either offer discounts or apply surcharges to subscribers to our aola country and web based interactive services who choose cash payment options 
free trial 
we generally make our aola country services  the aol branded service in puerto rico and our web based interactive services available for free to new subscribers for a limited period of time so they can experience our service offerings 
we currently offer new subscribers to our aola country services  including subscribers to the banco ita co branded service  a day free trial period from the date they register for the service 
subscribers to our web based interactive services who select cash payment options do not typically receive free trial periods 
in mexico  we eliminated free trial periods entirely for members who choose cash payment options 
strategic alliance with banco ita in june  we entered into a ten year strategic alliance with banco ita  one of the largest banks in latin america 
banco ita is obligated to market and promote a co branded version of our aola country service in brazil as the principal means of accessing banco ita s interactive financial services 
we also market a version of our web based interactive services in banco ita branches containing the same co branded features as the country service 
our relationship with banco ita is central to our marketing efforts in brazil 
on december   we amended our strategic marketing alliance with banco ita 
under the terms of the revised agreement  we now oversee  in large part  the marketing activities for the co branded service 
banco ita is obligated to establish kiosks and point of sale displays in hundreds of its bank branches for the promotion of the co branded services  which are staffed by promoters trained by aol brazil 
potential subscribers are able to sample the co branded services and register in the bank branches 
the number of promoters varies depending on the success of the marketing efforts  which are reviewed every three months 
if the marketing efforts do not meet specified goals  the number of promoters will be decreased  subject to a floor on the number of promoters 
conversely  if the marketing efforts exceed specified levels  the number of promoters will be increased  subject to a maximum number of promoters 
banco ita is also required to distribute  at our direction  cds containing the software for the co branded aola country service via in branch promotions and direct mail 
banco ita must also produce and broadcast a certain number of television commercials promoting the co branded services and provide exclusive online banking benefits to subscribers to the co branded services 
banco ita is responsible for the cost of these marketing efforts 
the modified marketing arrangements will remain in effect through march  although the ten year term of the agreement did not change 
banco ita is obligated to make cash payments to us if minimum annual revenue targets and marketing commitments are not met through march the maximum aggregate amount that banco ita will be required to pay us if these targets are not met  which 
table of contents we refer to as reference payments  is million  million and million in  and  respectively 
we expect to receive only minimal amounts from banco ita for its failure to meet revenue targets for the march  measurement date because we chose to receive payments from banco ita in lieu of marketing  as described below 
beginning in the second half of  as a result of lower than expected productivity  we reduced the number of promoters 
because of this reduction and our cancellation of certain cd distributions  banco ita made payments of million to us during in lieu of marketing activities it was obligated to make under our revised marketing agreement 
we expect these payments to continue in the future but the amounts to gradually decrease over time as per the terms of the revised marketing agreement 
we have the right to redeploy or reinstate some of the promoters in the branches in the future  in which case we would forego such payments from banco ita 
such payments from banco ita are accounted for as funds from financing activities in our statement of cash flows and will reduce future marketing expense by lowering the amortization expense associated with the shares issued to banco ita 
payments we receive from banco ita in lieu of marketing activities it is obligated to make result in a reduction of amounts owed to us as reference payments  since such amounts are considered revenues for purposes of calculating banco ita s performance under revenue targets 
banco ita s customers who register for the co branded services currently are entitled to a one month free trial period  the length of which may be changed in the future and  if they subscribe to the co branded aol country service on a monthly  bundled unlimited use plan  are entitled to a discount 
banco ita  at its option  may subsidize hours for certain customers who were subscribers to the co branded service prior to december  for the quarter ended december   the amount of subsidies paid by banco ita for its members was not material 
for the year ended december   we received million in subsidies for its members from banco ita 
termination 
in general  if we or banco ita commit a material breach of our agreement and fail to cure the breach  then the non breaching party will have the right to terminate the agreement after an arbiter reviews the matter and confirms the uncured material breach 
if the breach relates to an exclusivity provision  the non breaching party may elect to continue the agreement with the option to be relieved of the exclusivity provisions of the agreement applicable to it 
banco ita may also terminate the agreement upon a change in control of aola 
a material breach of the agreement by us includes if subscribers are unable to access the co branded service for specified periods of time  and our breach of certain exclusivity obligations under the agreement 
customer service one of the key tenets to our strategy is to focus on customer service by offering comprehensive online and offline customer support 
offline customer service 
we have a regional customer call center in argentina to provide support for our spanish language members in argentina  mexico and puerto rico 
we also have a portuguese language call center  which has been outsourced to a third party in brazil 
call center support was consolidated in argentina during for the aol branded service in puerto rico and in early for the aola country service in mexico to maximize operational efficiencies and benefit from lower cost opportunities afforded by the steep devaluation of the argentine peso 
america online provides english language support for members of the aol branded service in puerto rico 
we staff our call centers with knowledgeable customer service representatives who are available hours a day  seven days a week to assist our members in their local language with inquiries relating to products  technical support  billing  online security and online community monitoring 
our customer service is free of charge for subscribers enrolled in our bundled services plans 
it is provided through toll free telephone numbers in mexico  argentina and puerto rico 
email and live chat support are also provided 
customers enrolled in our lower cost unbundled service plans incur per call or time based charges for accessing live call center support 

table of contents our customer service representatives also proactively communicate with new members to encourage them to use our aola country service and their many features 
we believe this improves the member s online experience and leads to improved retention and increased loyalty 
online help 
our aola country services and web based interactive services provide extensive help features to assist new users coming online for the first time 
members are able to reach customer service representatives by e mail and aol instant messenger 
the aola country services also have the notify aol feature that allows members to contact us for security assistance and the download sentry alert feature that reminds members not to download files attached to e mails sent from strangers 
in addition  there are online areas where members can perform such self help functions as add delete sub accounts  change password  and update billing information or payment method 
content our aola interactive services feature content obtained from leading local  regional and global content providers and member generated content  including movie and book reviews  message board commentary and online discussions 
our agreements with third party content providers range from simple links between our interactive services and the provider s web site to an integration of their content into our interactive services 
we attempt to select our content providers based on the quality and depth of their content 
in brazil  we have entered into agreements with over content providers such as reuters  ag ncia estado  valor econ mico  klick educa o  editora delta  banana games and mundo da crian a 
in mexico  we have entered into agreements with over content providers  including mexsport  switch  cine premiere  el inversionista  efe  notimex  max  kokone kids only  universo e  gamers generation  toda mujer  salud y medicina 
in argentina  we have entered into agreements with over content providers including asatej  cybermapa  familia digital  de mujer and revista insider 
we have entered into agreements relating to the aol brand service in puerto rico with more than content providers including escape  clasificados online  superchicos  modaonline and dewey color system 
advertising and other revenues we generate a portion of our revenues from advertising on our online services 
such advertising revenues are derived from third party relationships 
through our relationship with america online  we sometimes have the opportunity to participate in america online s global advertising arrangements 
we also generate additional revenues from other sources such as programming services provided to america online for its latino content area and revenue sharing agreements with certain local telecommunications providers 
advertising 
the country specific and regional focus of our interactive services enables advertisers to execute advertising and marketing campaigns that take advantage of the common cultures and interests of the region while retaining the ability to tailor their campaigns to specific demographic groups 
we offer our advertisers a variety of customized programs for the marketing of products and services  including advertising arrangements under which we receive fees based on the number of advertisements displayed on our interactive services or the performance of these advertisements  and sponsorship or co sponsorship arrangements that allow advertisers to sponsor an area on our interactive services in exchange for a fixed payment 
in return for most advertising arrangements  we receive cash payments  the opportunity for revenue sharing  or both 
we have also entered into and may seek barter arrangements  including co marketing and cross promotion agreements 
to date  the number and effect of barter arrangements that we have entered into has not been material 
in the past  we have also accepted equity interests as payment  or partial payment  for arrangements entered into with development stage companies 
we may choose to accept such payments in the future  although we do not foresee any such transactions at present 

table of contents other revenues 
other revenues are comprised of fees we receive from america online for programming services we provide to america online for use on their latino content area  representation fees we receive from america online for selling advertising on their interactive services and fees we receive from local telecommunications companies for routing our traffic over their networks 
we provided programming services for a content area on the aol service in the united states targeted to the hispanic community 
under the one year contract dated february  america online was obligated to pay us  per year for these programming services to reimburse us for our costs 
this agreement expired in february however  we are in discussions with america online for a new agreement under which america online would pay us  per year and provide us with certain product development services for our spanish language client software at no charge 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to reach agreement with america online regarding our potential provision of these services 
because local telephone service in latin america is often metered  the utilization of our aola country services by our members results in incremental revenues to local telecommunications companies 
to encourage incremental traffic on their local networks by our members  local providers of network access may enter into agreements compensating us for routing our traffic on their networks 
these agreements are recorded in either revenues or both revenues and cost of revenues 
this depends on whether we receive only cash payments or whether we receive services from the telecommunications provider 
if we receive services  we must be able to estimate the fair value of the services to recognize revenues and expense 
if we are not able to determine a fair value for the services received from the telecommunication providers  we do not reflect revenue or expense 
as a consequence  our expense is lower 
under certain agreements with telecommunications providers  we receive payments based on the number of modems we have connected to the telecommunications provider s network 
such payments are accounted for as reductions in cost of revenues 
cash payments received from telecommunications providers are accounted for as other revenue 
currently  we have such agreements with telecommunications providers in argentina and brazil 
such revenues have not been material in the past and we do not expect such revenues to be material in the future 
marketing our marketing goals are to attract new consumers to subscribe to  and to retain existing subscribers of  our aola country services and our web based interactive services by building brand awareness and encouraging consumers to try our interactive services 
in the past  we typically distributed cds containing the software for our country service 
these cds offered new consumers the opportunity to use our online service free of charge for a limited trial period and were distributed through a broad range of distribution vehicles 
beginning in  we largely ceased the mass distribution of cds in an effort to target higher value members and to reduce costs 
we now acquire new members primarily through point of sale displays and kiosks located in high traffic retail locations such as shopping malls and large retailers  and through kiosks located at banco ita bank branches in brazil 
we also seek to attract members through agreements with computer and computer peripheral manufacturers oems 
for example  we currently have agreements for the bundling of our america online service software with hewlett packard in mexico and brazil  and with samsung and lucky goldstar in brazil 
since  when we began to significantly reduce our spending on member acquisition  we have been relying primarily on co branded and joint marketing arrangements  where a third party partner is responsible for undertaking and implementing a significant percentage of the marketing effort 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview 

table of contents local and long distance telephone service  telecommunications network capacity and technology local and long distance telephone service 
in each of our latin american target markets  our members initiate access to our aol country services through local and long distance dial up telephone lines or via tcp ip through dsl or cable broadband access 
the dial up lines are owned and operated by local and regional telephone service companies 
local and regional telephone or cable companies provide the broadband connectivity 
in most latin american countries  local phone service continues to be metered  which results in incremental variable cost to subscribers of our country services 
metered phone service allows us to reduce expenses through revenue sharing agreements with local phone companies in brazil and also earn additional immaterial revenues in argentina 
the telephone service industry in latin america continues to undergo considerable change 
many latin american telephone companies in recent years have undertaken significant investments in their infrastructure 
these investments have resulted in an improvement in the quality of telephone service in these countries 
although the telephone service industry in latin america is significantly less developed outside of major cities than in the us  we believe that the local and long distance telephone service available is of adequate quality and sufficient capacity to meet the needs of our prospective members 
additionally  local and long distance telephone charges have declined over time  a trend that is expected to continue as a result of increased competition spurred by deregulation 
nevertheless  because local calls in most latin american countries are metered  the total cost of internet access in most of latin america can be substantially higher than in the us proposals are currently pending in brazil that would implement new pricing structures  including flat rate pricing options for data calls  in addition to existing metered local telephone service 
if adopted at reasonable price points for consumers  we believe these new proposals would increase internet usage by lowering the overall cost of accessing the internet 
however  governmental approval is still needed before such proposals could go into effect 
telecommunications network capacity 
third party telecommunications network providers transmit our online services data between the local and long distance telephone services used by our members in latin america and america online s servers  which run all of our interactive services  in the us and brazil  as well as connect our members to the internet 
these third party networks provide the modems that allow our members to establish a connection to our online services and the internet 
they also carry our data between latin america and the us by satellite and through fiber optic cable 
in brazil  we have contracts with embratel  an affiliate of mci  telefonica  brazil telecom and telemar to carry our data within brazil and to provide the modems through which our members connect to our america online brazil country and web based interactive services 
embratel and telefonica also carry our data from brazil to the us through their own or affiliates networks or through third party suppliers 
our contracts with telefonica and embratel expire on december  and may   respectively 
our contracts with brasil telecom and telemar expire in april and july  respectively 
we also have access to capacity provided by progress telecommunications corporation progress through a contract between america online and progress  which expires in april america online invoices us for the capacity used by us under this agreement 
in mexico  we have an agreement through june of with tel fonos de mexico telmex under which telmex provides us with the majority of our network capacity 
we also have a network contract with avantel  an affiliate of mci  which expires in january  under which avantel provides us with additional network capacity 
in argentina  we have entered into a network contract with impsat 
our contract with impsat expires on december  in puerto rico  our dial up network is provided by centennial de puerto rico under a contract between america online and centennial which expires on april   but which is renewable annually for three additional years 
in each of our target markets we work closely with our network providers to ensure satisfactory network performance 
we work with network providers that have multiple operations centers for network monitoring and we have developed quality control standards that our providers must meet 
fiber optic cable is our preferred means of transmitting data between latin america and the us because it offers 
table of contents greater capacity and is generally more reliable than satellite based transmissions 
we do not expect that we will need to enter into additional fiber optic network contracts in the near future 
in each country where we operate our aola country services  we believe that we have secured adequate network capacity 
to ensure this going forward  we regularly forecast our needs and may make adjustments based on marketing projections and other considerations 
we believe our current suppliers can and will provide us with sufficient network capacity 
however  this capacity is based on our expectations of use and growth in specific geographic areas 
some of our contracts commit us to purchase minimum amounts of network capacity 
if the number of our subscribers  or their use of our online services  do not meet these minimums  our per unit network costs could increase 
in recent years  we have paid penalties to telecommunications providers to reduce network capacity as part of our efforts to size our infrastructure to members who pay on a timely basis 
technology 
our main servers are owned and maintained by america online in three locations in virginia in the united states and in sao paulo  brazil 
the aola content and the tools to operate our online services are located on these servers 
our members can access our online services only through personal computers using the windows   me  and xp operating systems and our windows compatible online service software 
in addition  users of wap enabled phones in each country can access certain features and content of the aola country services 
our online services support the v 
standards for access at kilobits per second 
in brazil  our members can also access broadband services via cable and via dsl connections 
competition we operate in the highly competitive and rapidly evolving businesses of online services and internet access  and online advertising 
we compete primarily with providers of spanish and portuguese language internet access services 
our principal regional market competitors include terra lycos  an affiliate of telef nica  and microsoft msn 
our primary local competitors in our core target countries include universo online uol and terra lycos and free services provided by internet gratis ig  super and ibest in brazil  telmex in mexico  which has an alliance with microsoft for the development of content and offers a prodigy branded service  ciudad internet  advance  which is owned by telefonica argentina  uol sinectis  and arnet  which is owned by telecom  and free services provided by fullzero  tutopia and alternativa gratis in argentina  and coquinet prt 
net service offered by telefonica de puerto rico and caribe 
net in puerto rico 
the regulatory environment in brazil is supportive of providers of free internet access in brazil and the number of free internet service providers has increased recently with the entry of local telephone companies 
as a result  free internet access providers have continued to attract significant numbers of new users in brazil 
our online service subscription fees for our aola country services and the co branded service in puerto rico are generally higher than those offered by competing online service providers because we consider our service to be a premium service 
in order to better compete with providers of low cost and free internet services  we recently launched our web based interactive services in brazil  puerto rico and argentina 
we regularly review the actions of our competitors and our competitive position 
based on these reviews  we may consider changes in our pricing to be more competitive 
we also compete for advertising revenues with traditional media such as newspapers  magazines  radio and television 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in generating advertising revenue include the demographics of visitors  in addition to the number of visitors to an online service or internet site 
however  the reduction in membership we experienced during has negatively impacted our ability to provide advertisers with viewer impressions  and as a result advertising revenue has not recovered in line with the overall market

trademarks and domain names america online has granted us rights to use in latin america its registered trademarks containing the aol brand and domain names

government regulation and legal uncertainties in brazil  there are no license or registration requirements applicable to interactive services 
however  the brazilian legislature is considering various laws that would regulate interactive service providers  including laws that would create potential liabilities for isps whose members offer illegal goods  services or information through their service  laws allowing telecommunication providers to provide interactive services and laws regarding taxation of interactive service providers 
we cannot predict at this time whether or not these bills will be enacted or  if enacted  whether they will undergo major changes or what any potential effect on our business could be 
we believe regulations relating to local telephone pricing are likely to be modified in brazil  upon expiration in january of the law which privatized the national telephone monopoly in  which 
table of contents granted exclusive franchise rights to the newly privatized local telephone companies 
possible modifications include a possible change that would permit alternative rate pricing for internet access calls  including flat rate pricing 
we believe that this change  if enacted  could encourage internet usage by lowering the total cost of internet access for consumers 
in connection with this proposed regulation  rules governing interconnection fees between telecommunications providers may also be modified 
if such rules were to be modified  we would expect to lose revenues we currently receive from telecommunications providers for routing our traffic over their lines 
we cannot predict at this time whether or not these regulations will be enacted or  if enacted  what form of alternative rate pricing might be adopted  or what any potential effect on our business could be 
these changes would also likely impact the competition for interactive services in brazil  although we cannot predict what the impact may be 
in mexico  the federal telecommunications law requires providers of value added services  including internet access services  to register with the mexican federal telecommunications commission 
we have complied with this registration requirement 
in argentina  internet access providers must hold a correspondent license from the argentine telecommunications authority 
we have received this license 
the argentine federal government does not specifically regulate information available on the internet 
however  argentine laws and regulations on consumer protection  contract  competition and advertising generally apply to portal and commerce service providers 
in this respect  several judicial precedents have recognized the applicability of commercial  criminal and civil law to internet matters 
we intend to support proposals designed to enhance market access and competition in the offering of both dial up and high speed interactive services in our target markets and believe that the adoption of these proposals would have a beneficial effect on the development of interactive services 
we are unable  at this time  to predict whether any of these proposals will be adopted

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview 
during  we continued our focus on initiatives  which we began in  designed to better target higher value members  size our telecommunications and member services infrastructure to support only those members who are timely in their payments to us  and continue lowering our overall costs and expenses 
we define higher value members as members who pay us on a timely basis and who have a greater likelihood of remaining subscribers to our services for an extended period of time 
these initiatives included efforts to focus on marketing channels that are cost efficient and likely to produce registrations resulting in higher value members  efforts to gain specific marketing commitments from our partners and efforts to continue lowering our network and member services costs 
this focus had several important effects on our fiscal results  as compared with results  including a significant reduction in operating loss and cash utilization  a significant reduction in our cost of revenues  sales and marketing expenses and other expenses  and a significant decrease in our total membership 
to better compete against low cost internet providers  better address consumer needs and to continue reducing our overall costs and expenses  we launched web based services in brazil and argentina in the second half of we expect this to become our primary service in both brazil and argentina 
we are no longer actively promoting the aola country services in brazil and argentina  although we plan to 
table of contents continue offering and providing our country services in brazil and argentina 
in february  we also launched a low cost web based service offering minimal email and content in puerto rico to address the low cost internet segment where we did not previously have a presence 
we are currently testing a web based product offering in mexico 
a decision on whether or not to launch our web based service in mexico will depend on the test results 
our future membership levels and our economic performance in brazil and argentina will be highly influenced by the extent of success of our web based product offerings 
approximately of the membership totals as of december  were subscribers to our web based interactive services 
we expect to experience migration of membership from our aol brazil and aol argentina country services and the aol branded service in puerto rico to our new web based services 
to date  approximately of members of our web based services in brazil and argentina had migrated from our aola country services 
initial results in brazil indicate that membership turnover is lower for our web based offerings than for our aola country services 
however  at this time we cannot predict whether the improvements will continue or will be sufficient to achieve our economic viability 
our greater selectivity in the acquisition of new members has resulted in fewer new registrations  but which we hope will eventually be of higher value 
our rate of member acquisitions has also been affected by reduced marketing expenditures and our increased focus on marketing efficiency  which resulted in a smaller number of kiosks in retail locations 
registration rates and member turnover rates  and therefore total membership  continue to be negatively impacted by competition  especially in brazil 
the regulatory environment in brazil  under which the cost of local internet connection calls results in incremental revenues to local telephone companies  continues to be supportive of lower cost and free internet service providers 
as a result  the brazilian market has continued to experience a proliferation of new competitors 
over the longer term  we hope that our strategy of focusing on higher value members will result in lower overall membership turnover 
during  our membership turnover rates improved in mexico and modestly in the banco ita segment of our brazil business  although not sufficiently to stem losses from reduced levels of marketing activities and continued competitive pressures 
membership turnover  however  has not improved for the non ita aola country service in brazil nor for the aola country service in argentina 
our membership in fell from million on december  to  on december  during the fourth quarter of  membership fell from  to  we expect that our membership base will decrease by approximately  members in the first quarter of  to approximately  driven by the competitive environment in brazil and by continued delays in the implementation of the mcdonald s marketing agreement in brazil 
we anticipate growth in membership to resume in the second half of  depending on the consumer acceptance of our web based services and upon the success of our mcdonald s initiative 
membership in our banco ita co branded service decreased from  members at december  to  members  or of our total membership base  at december  as a result of the termination of members who had not chosen a paid plan and membership turnover 
termination of these members did not materially impact our revenues or costs since a substantial majority of these members were not paying us or using the service 
total membership counts include members of our aol country services  our web based interactive services and broadband offerings  as well as members of the co branded banco ita service 
our membership totals also include members participating in free trial periods and retention programs 
as of december   of our members  including members still on their trial periods  had selected credit cards  direct debit and other non cash payment options  which have a better rate of collection than cash payment methods  as compared with approximately as of december  approximately of our total subscribers at december   were in free trial periods or member retention programs  as compared with approximately as of december  as we have reduced our spending on acquisition marketing activities  we have increased our reliance on co branded and joint marketing arrangements  where a third party partner is responsible for implementing a significant percentage of the marketing effort 
our two main marketing arrangements are 
table of contents the revised marketing agreement with banco ita and the mcdonald s marketing agreement  both in brazil 
in mexico and puerto rico  we have continued our reliance on existing distribution channels  focusing primarily on targeted increases in the number of kiosks located at retail locations 
our reliance on the marketing efforts of strategic partners has reduced the rate at which we use cash and has lowered our sales and marketing expenses  since costs incurred by our partners are not accounted for in our reported results 
however  reliance on third party arrangements has also increased the potential for unforeseen delays over which we have limited control  as has been the case with mcdonald s in brazil 
failure to successfully implement the mcdonald s agreement or to achieve the subscriber targets in the banco ita agreement would negatively impact our future membership levels 
during  we experienced a decrease in our subscription revenues as compared with the prior year 
this reduction was driven by declines in brazil  mexico and argentina  which were partially offset by increases in puerto rico 
the losses in brazil  mexico and argentina were driven by both currency devaluation and a reduction in paid membership 
the loss of paying members has been the main factor driving lower subscription revenues in the second half of future subscription revenue performance will be highly influenced by the extent of success of our new web based product offerings in reducing membership turnover and in attracting new members 
we expect our subscription revenues to decrease at least through the first half of  driven by the continued reduction in paid membership and by the expected increase in subscribers to our lower priced web based services rather than our higher priced services 
advertising and other revenue continued to decrease throughout  despite an improved online advertising environment in latin america 
we expect our advertising and other revenue to continue decreasing in as a result of our reduced membership base  our lack of success in attracting significant commitments from traditional media advertisers and the expiration of long term contracts in other revenues are expected to decrease due to the expiration of our agreement to provide programming services to america online for their latino content area 
although we expect our revenues to decrease in  we also expect our costs to continue decreasing as well 
telecommunication costs are expected to decrease  primarily as a result negotiated reductions in network unit prices and capacity achieved in  while sales and marketing expenses are expected to continue decreasing as a result of lower average number of kiosks in operation and additional reductions in the distributions of cds 
as a result  we expect to further reduce our losses in we finished with available cash on hand of million as of december   which we expect will be sufficient to fund operations into the first quarter of  based upon our current operating budget 

table of contents consolidated results of operations revenues 
total revenues consist of subscription revenues and advertising and other revenues 
the following table presents the components of our revenues for the years ended december   december  and december  revenues by segment year ended december  ber  december  dollars in thousands change change change change revenues subscriptions advertising and other distribution of revenues subscriptions advertising and other subscription revenues 
we derive our subscription revenues from members paying fees to subscribe to our aola country services and to our web based interactive services  and from revenues received from america online related to subscribers to the aol branded service in puerto rico 
subscription revenues do not include amounts paid to us by banco ita on behalf of its customers for subsidies that it chooses or was required to make 
such receipts from banco ita are netted against and recorded as a reduction of marketing expenses and thus are not accounted for as subscription revenues 
amounts paid directly to us by subscribers that exceed any time subsidized by banco ita are included in subscription revenues 
under the terms of the revised marketing agreement  banco ita is no longer required to subsidize its customers who are subscribers to the co branded service 
as a result  subsidies from banco ita for its customers were not material for the second half of we do not expect subsidies from banco ita for its customers to be material in future periods 
for subscribers that have elected to pay their subscription fees with credit cards  we begin to recognize subscription revenues when the fees become due and are confirmed as collectible 
for subscribers that pay through means other than credit cards  we begin to recognize subscription revenues when we receive payment 
advertising and other revenue 
advertising and other revenue is derived principally from advertising arrangements under which we receive fees for advertisements displayed on our interactive services  advertising sponsorship or co sponsorship arrangements that allow advertisers to sponsor an area on our interactive services in exchange for a fee  fees we receive from america online for programming services we provide to america online for use on their latino content area  representation fees we receive from america online for selling advertising on their interactive services  and revenue sharing arrangements with local telecommunications providers 
because local telephone service in latin america is often metered  the utilization of our aola country services and of our web based interactive services by our members results in incremental revenues to local telecommunications companies 
to encourage incremental traffic on their local networks by our members  some local providers of network access have entered into agreements compensating us for routing our traffic on their networks 

table of contents subscription revenues fiscal compared to fiscal subscription revenue for the year ended december  was million  a decrease of million  or  as compared to million in the year ended december  for  the overall decrease in subscription revenue as compared to the prior year was primarily due to currency devaluation 
currency devaluation reduced revenues by million during the fiscal year 
excluding the impact of currency devaluation  however  subscription revenue gains in puerto rico were offset by subscription revenue losses in brazil  mexico and argentina 
furthermore  in the second half of  losses in paying subscribers began to drive decreases in total subscription revenues 
increased competition and reduced marketing expenditures resulted in a lower level of registrations  which was insufficient to replace members lost through attrition 
this resulted in a lower number of paying subscribers 
on a sequential quarter basis  reported subscription revenue declined by to million in the fourth quarter of  or by approximately million  from million in the quarter ended september  subscription revenues were negatively impacted by declines in paying membership  driven by attrition of members who had been paying their fees to us 
subscription revenues have been negatively impacted by an increase in our member turnover resulting from lower priced competitors  including providers of free internet access in brazil 
furthermore  our rate of new member registrations has not been sufficient to offset membership losses 
the rate of new member registrations has been negatively impacted by our strategy of targeting higher value members  by a lower than expected level of registrations at a significant percentage of our interactive kiosks located in banco ita branches and by the continued delay in the implementation of the mcdonald s marketing initiative in brazil 
going forward  we expect that subscriber revenue performance will depend primarily on the success of our web based interactive services in attracting new members and improving overall membership retention 
subscriber revenues will also be influenced by the success of our banco ita and mcdonald s initiatives in brazil  since these are our primary channels for acquiring new registrations 
we expect subscription revenue for to decrease  as a result of continued reductions in paid members and as a result of the increase in the percentage of subscribers to our lower priced web based services versus our higher priced services 
we anticipate modest growth in subscription revenue to resume in the second half of  depending on the consumer acceptance of our web based services and upon the success of our mcdonald s initiative 
fiscal compared to fiscal for the fiscal year ended december   subscription revenues reached million  an increase of as compared to million in the year ended december  year over year results were driven by increases in the number of paid members to our aola country services and the aol branded service in puerto rico 
in constant currency terms  which exclude the effects of currency devaluation  subscription revenues increased as compared to the year ended december  advertising and other revenues fiscal compared to fiscal for the year ended december   revenue from advertising and other was million  a decrease of million  or  from million in the year ended december  the decrease in advertising and other revenue resulted primarily from our failure to convince advertisers to redirect resources from traditional media channels to our interactive services  partially offset by increased revenue from america online for our programming services related to their latino content area 
sequentially  advertising and other revenue in the fourth quarter of experienced a decrease of million  or  from million in our fiscal third quarter  driven by lower advertising revenue and the loss of revenue from the expiration of our long term contract with hollywood media corp 

table of contents we expect advertising and other revenue to decrease further during fiscal  driven by continued weak advertising results and the loss of revenue from the expiration of our long term contract with hollywood media corp 
and other long term advertising agreements 
we have not been successful in convincing advertisers in latin america to redirect resources from traditional media channels to online advertising on our services 
the reduction in membership levels we experienced in and that we expect to experience in the first half of is also expected to further restrict our ability to generate revenue from advertising by reducing our ability to generate consumer impressions 
we expect our first quarter advertising and other revenue to register a significant decline versus the fourth quarter of we expect to continue deriving the substantial majority of our revenues from subscriptions to our aola country services and our web based interactive services  rather than from advertising and other revenues 
as of december   deferred advertising and other revenue amounted to million  down from million at december  deferred revenues from advertising and other consists of payments received in advance of our delivery of the related service and are recognized as income as the services are delivered 
the decline in the balance of deferred advertising and other revenue year over year is primarily due to amortization of a long term contract with hollywood media corp  which expired in october during the year ended december   advertising and other revenue from related parties accounted for approximately  or million  of the million recorded for the period  as compared with million in advertising revenue from banco ita amounted to million in other revenue from america online in was million  and consisted primarily of fees for our programming of america online s latino content area and of representation fees for advertising sold on the america online service in the us banco ita accounted for the entire amount of fiscal related party advertising and other revenue 
fiscal compared to fiscal for the year ended december   revenue from advertising and other declined by million  or  to million  from million in the year ended december  the decrease in advertising and other revenues was driven primarily by the weak advertising market in latin america  with all our countries except puerto rico recording declines

cost of revenues includes network related costs consisting primarily of fees paid to third parties to carry our data over their telecommunications networks  personnel and related costs for customer support and in house product and content development  fees we pay to america online for use of their servers that run our interactive services ie hosting services  fees we pay to america online for technical support and training  fees we pay to america online for product development  fees paid to third party content providers  and collection costs and certain miscellaneous taxes 
we are primarily responsible for the hosting  technical support  development and billing for our web based services 
total out of pocket cost associated with the development and launch of our web based services in brazil  argentina and puerto rico is expected to be million 
of this amount  we incurred approximately million in the twelve months ended december  fiscal compared to fiscal for the year ended december   cost of revenues was million  a decrease of million  or as compared with million in the year ended december  the decrease was driven by lower network and telecommunications costs and member services costs  reflecting the renegotiation of network unit costs  including the impact for the full year of zero port cost arrangements with telecommunications providers  and the consolidation and outsourcing of our member services operations 
hosting costs were also lower  reflecting lower usage  primarily as a result of our termination of members who were delinquent in their payments of fees to us 
these reductions were in addition to cost reduction efforts taken in product development costs  which are primarily driven by development needs for our aola country services  also decreased in as a result of our strategic focus on web based services 
cost of revenues in fiscal also reflected lower one time charges 
table of contents associated with efforts to reduce the size of our network 
cost of revenues accounted for of our total costs in  down from in the prior year period 
currency devaluation reduced reported cost of revenues by  or million  during the fiscal year 
going forward  we expect cost of revenues in to decrease in absolute terms from levels experienced in fiscal  as we continue to benefit from prior actions taken to renegotiate our network prices and size and from a full year impact of the consolidation and outsourcing of member services activities 
cost of revenues paid to related parties primarily consists of payments made or due to america online and its affiliates for the costs of hosting  maintenance  product development and other technical support services for our country operations 
during the years ended december  and  the cost of these services amounted to million and million  respectively 
as of december   america online had billed us approximately million  primarily related to costs from  over and above amounts we have recorded in our statements of operations 
the difference related to a portion of items under dispute  primarily for support services provided by america online 
this dispute was settled in our favor in february in a manner which is consistent with our historical accounting treatment and which did not have any cash impact on our financial condition 
america online is no longer seeking payment for these amounts 
we received a credit for these invoices on march  fiscal compared to fiscal for the year ended december   our cost of revenues declined by approximately  or million  to million  from million in our fiscal year 
the decrease was driven by reductions in network and telecommunications costs and call center costs  reflecting primarily the impact of initiatives to resize our network and call centers to focus on higher quality members 
we achieved this by restricting access to our network and call center support services to members who are delinquent in their payments of fees to us 
cost of revenues during fiscal also included one time costs of million to reduce the size our network to service the smaller base of members 
cost of revenues accounted for of our total cost structure during  up from in the comparable prior year period 
currency devaluation reduced reported cost of revenues by approximately  or million  during the fiscal year 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses include our costs to acquire and retain our members  the operating expenses for our sales and marketing efforts and other general marketing costs 
the costs to acquire and retain our members include direct marketing costs such as the costs of kiosks and related support and the costs of cds and their distribution as well as the costs of brand advertising on television and in newspapers  magazines and other media 
also included in sales and marketing expense is amortization of the value of the shares of our class a common stock issued to banco ita in consideration for its entering into the strategic marketing alliance with us see item business strategic alliance with banco ita  as well as note to our audited consolidated financial statements 
fiscal compared to fiscal sales and marketing expense was million in the year ended december   a decrease of million from million in the year ended december  the reduction in sales and marketing expenditures during fiscal was driven by reductions in both member acquisition costs and brand marketing 
the reduction in member acquisition costs was achieved through our continued focus on initiatives designed to target members who have higher probabilities of becoming and remaining paying members 
specifically  we significantly reduced the mass mailing of non solicited cd s containing our software in favor of an increased focus on acquiring members through direct customer interaction channels  primarily through staffed kiosks at high traffic retail locations 
during  we also evaluated the productivity of our kiosks located at banco ita branches and at retail locations in brazil  mexico and 
table of contents puerto rico  and closed those with lower than acceptable levels of registrations 
as a result  a substantial majority of the kiosks in operation at the beginning of at banco ita branches were closed  as were a majority of the kiosks at retail locations in mexico  resulting in additional savings 
in addition  we also cancelled certain cd distributions banco ita was obligated to make  but did not at our request 
as a result of the cancellation of marketing activities banco ita was obligated to make  as per the terms of our revised marketing agreement  banco ita made a payment to us of approximately million during in exchange for advertising on our service in lieu of the marketing activities they were obligated to undertake 
we expect these payments to continue in the future but the amounts to gradually decrease over time as per the terms of the revised marketing agreement 
such payments from banco ita are reflected as funds received from financing activities in our statement of cash flows and reduce future marketing expense associated with the amortization of shares given to banco ita under our strategic marketing agreement 
we have the right to choose to redeploy or reinstate some promoters in the branches in the future  in which case we would forego the corresponding payments from banco ita 
brand marketing expense was also reduced by million during  despite advertising expenditures related to the launch of our web based services 
the reduction was made possible by our increased reliance on third party marketing arrangements  such as banco ita s advertisement of our services in accordance with our revised marketing agreement 
we were also able to reduce brand marketing expenditures as a result of our more targeted marketing efforts 
currency devaluation reduced sales and marketing expense in fiscal by approximately million 
for the year ended december   sales and marketing expenses incurred with related parties were million  excluding amortization expense related to the banco ita revised marketing agreement 
this expense was primarily for advertising on time warner media properties 
for the year ended december   expenses incurred with related parties were million  and were also for advertising on time warner media properties 
for the year ended december   monies received from banco ita for subsidies it pays on behalf of its members were approximately million  compared with million in subsidies paid by banco ita on behalf of its members largely ceased during the third quarter of as a result of the revised marketing agreement with banco ita  under which banco ita is no longer required to make subsidy payments to us on behalf of its members to the co branded service 
amortization expense related to the banco ita marketing agreement was million in and million in for a discussion of advertising and other relationships with time warner and banco ita  please see item certain relationships and related transactions 
we expect to continue focusing our member acquisition efforts on marketing agreements with third parties  emphasizing kiosks located in high traffic areas  including bank branches  retail outlets and restaurants 
we have also benefited from marketing arrangements with telecommunication providers who provide access for our broadband product in brazil whereby they produce and air co branded television commercials 
we expect sales and marketing expense to further decrease by a modest amount in as compared with fiscal compared to fiscal for the year ended december   sales and marketing expense was million  a decrease of approximately  or million  versus the million incurred in the year ended december  the reduction in sales and marketing expenditures during fiscal was achieved by the implementation of initiatives designed to target members who have higher probabilities of becoming and remaining paying members 
this change in strategy resulted in a significant reduction in the mass mailing of non solicited cd s containing our software in favor of an increased focus on acquiring members through direct customer interaction channels and increased reliance on third party marketing arrangements 
currency devaluation also accounted for part of the variation in sales and marketing expense during fiscal  reducing reported expense by approximately million 

table of contents excluding the impact of the banco ita amortization expense  expenditures related to sales and marketing decreased by million  or  versus the prior year  as a result of the absence of launch related expenditures in and lower per unit cd and distribution costs 
during the year ended december   sales and marketing expenses continued as our single largest cost category 
although down from in the comparable prior year period  sales and marketing expenses represented of total costs and expenses during fiscal general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel related expenses  office lease payments  legal  tax and travel related expenses  among others 
fiscal compared to fiscal for the year ended december   general and administrative expenses were million  a decrease of million  or  from million in the fiscal year ended december  the reduction in general and administrative expense was driven by lower personnel related expenses due to employee work force reductions 
currency devaluations decreased reported general and administrative expense by approximately million during our fiscal year 
our general and administrative costs in the quarter ended december   decreased by million  or  to million  from million in the fourth quarter of the decline in general and administrative expense was primarily due to lower staffing levels in the fourth quarter of  as compared to the prior year period  and personnel severance expense in the prior year period 
we expect that our general and administrative expenses will continue near current levels in both america online and the cisneros group have in the past provided us with general and administrative services 
in the year ended december   we incurred general and administrative expenses of  to america online 
in the year ended december   we incurred fees of approximately million and  for support services provided by america online and for services provided by the cisneros group  respectively 
fiscal compared to fiscal for the year ended december   general and administrative expenses were approximately million  a decrease of million  or  from million in the prior year 
this reduction in general and administrative expense reflects the benefits from our september workforce reduction  the impact of currency devaluation in brazil and argentina and reduced bad debt expense 
reported general and administrative expense for fiscal was lower by million as a result of currency devaluations experienced during the year 
interest expense 
interest expense consists almost entirely of interest on our senior convertible notes outstanding 
the increase in interest expense in was primarily due to the higher average balance of our senior convertible notes outstanding million  as compared with million 
for fiscal  we expect that our interest expense will remain relatively stable as the average balance of senior convertible notes outstanding will remain at current levels 
we continue to expect to pay the interest on the senior convertible notes through the issuance of additional stock  consequently  interest expense should not have a cash impact on our financial condition 
however  depending on market conditions at the time  a decision by us to pay the interest on the senior convertible notes through the issuance of additional shares of stock could result in significant additional dilution to our existing shareholders 
for the year ended december   interest expense was approximately million  as compared to  in the year ended december  the increase in interest expense was driven by sale of senior convertible notes to time warner for purposes of financing our business 
the agreement to sell the senior convertible to time warner was entered into in march  and the purchase of the entire amount 
table of contents of million available under the agreement was completed during the period ended december  other income other income consists primarily of foreign currency gains and losses and realized gains and losses on investments 
for the year ended december   other income was million  an increase from million in the year ended december  the increase resulted from interest income on our cash and cash equivalent balances  which increased as a result of the final sale of senior convertible notes to time warner on december  for the year ended december   other income of  was a decrease from million in the year ended december  this decrease of million was due to significantly lower interest income  as we reduced our cash balances to fund the business and instead began to incur interest expense related to our issuance of senior convertible notes to time warner in connection with our march financing 
we also incurred an impairment loss of our investment in hollywood media corp 
of approximately million during income taxes for the year ended december   we had a provision of  related to income taxes 
for the year ended december  we had a provision of  related to income taxes 
our income tax expense results from the application of gross asset taxes in argentina and mexico  which are used as alternative minimum tax systems by the governments of these countries and may be applied as credits for actual future income taxes

the year over year decrease was achieved primarily as a result of our efforts to reduce the size of our network to service only members who are timely in their payments of subscription fees to us  our efforts to reduce the unit cost of modems  and our reduced office facilities requirements related to the consolidation of our member services operations and other workforce reductions 
in accordance with current accounting rules  the future rights and obligations pertaining to such commitments are not reflected as assets or liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
our network agreements do not extend beyond  therefore the foregoing table does not reflect any amounts in and beyond 
we expect to replace expiring contracts at future dates 

table of contents the above table does not include items that are variable or contingent in nature  but which have a high likelihood of occurring 
such items include interest on our senior convertible notes million per year  except for million in interest which we will be obligated to pay in cash at the final maturity date on march   hosting  maintenance and product development and other services provided by america online under our online services agreement million in  and accrued  but unpaid  dividends on our preferred series b and series c preferred stock amounting to million as of december  
we expect these expenses to continue  although amounts may vary  in the future 
we also have contractual obligations related to employee retention agreements with certain key employees 
under these retention agreements we may be obligated to make payments amounting up to approximately million in payment of these amounts may be accelerated upon certain events 
additionally  under the terms of our amended and restated charter on august   we must redeem approximately of the then outstanding series b and c preferred stock 
the exact percentage to be redeemed is subject to adjustment based on the number of shares we will issue in payment of interest on our senior convertible notes through august   which is in turn dependent on the price of our class a common stock 
america online and time warner hold our series b preferred stock and the cisneros group and its affiliates hold our series c preferred stock 
of the remaining balance of the series b and c preferred stock outstanding  we must redeem an additional amount on april  and the balance on march  as of december   we had  shares of series b preferred stock outstanding and  shares of series c preferred stock outstanding 
as per our restated charter  the redemption price per share will be approximately  or an aggregate redemption price for the august  redemption of approximately million excluding accrued  but unpaid  dividends of approximately million which we are required to pay at the time of redemption  based on the current number of shares of series b and c preferred stock currently outstanding 
the series b and series c preferred stock may be redeemed  at our option  in cash  by delivery of shares of class a common stock or by any combination of cash and shares of class a common stock  valued at its then fair market value 
however  due to our limited cash position  we expect to redeem these shares of preferred stock through the issuance of shares of class a common stock 
the august  redemption would result in additional dilution to our class a stockholders of approximately  assuming the fair market value of our class a common stock at the time of redemption is

current liabilities at december  were million  down million  or  from million at december  current liabilities decreased as a result of the decrease in our membership base and our efforts to reduce our overall cost structure 
our working capital balance at december  was million  down from million at the end of the prior year 
long term debt of million at both december  and was comprised of the outstanding balance of senior convertible notes issued to time warner 
the decrease in current assets at december  was attributable to the use of initial cash balances throughout the year to finance operating losses and other operating requirements  partially offset by the receipt of cash from banco ita in lieu of marketing activities it was obligated to make under the terms of our revised marketing agreement 
the decrease in current liabilities primarily reflects a reduction in accounts payable resulting from a reduction in cost of revenues and sales and marketing expenditures 
as discussed previously  our level of expenditures has been reduced significantly as result of our change in marketing strategy and product offerings and our efforts to continue reducing our cost structure 
we anticipate available cash on hand of million as of december   to be sufficient to fund operations into the first quarter of  based upon our current operating budget 
this represents an extension in the duration of funding sufficiency from our previous estimate and is due to our success in reducing operating losses 
our expectations underlying our current operating budget and the duration of funding sufficiency are based upon certain estimates that we believe are commercially reasonable in relation to our historical experience 
these estimates include paid membership levels and turnover  consumer acceptance of our web based interactive services  pricing of our services and continued cost reductions 
these estimates are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties more particularly described 
table of contents in risk factors below and there can be no assurance that they will turn out to be accurate 
as of march  approximately million of our cash on hand served to collateralize our obligations under executive retention agreements and is not  and will not be  available for general corporate use 
our planning is focused on achieving operating cash self sufficiency beyond based on available cash on hand 
we also continue to explore various opportunities that could provide us with additional capital resources in the future  in the event we are unable to achieve our operating goals 
in addition  we have not identified additional sources of financing necessary to repay the million senior convertible notes that will be due in march there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to achieve cash self sufficiency with available resources  or that we will be able to identify additional sources of capital to repay our debt obligations or operate our business  if needed 
an additional restriction on our ability to obtain additional funding is that the holders of the senior convertible notes can require that the proceeds of any such financing or the sale of assets be used to repay the senior convertible notes 
in addition  there is no commitment or obligation from america online  the cisneros group or banco ita to fund any of our future requirements 
furthermore  time warner has stated that it does not intend to provide us with additional funding

capital expenditures during were an additional million 
this was financed through a reduction in the amount of cash on hand at the beginning of the year and through million received from banco ita in lieu of marketing activities it was obligated to undertake under the terms of our revised marketing agreement 
monies received from banco ita in lieu of marketing activities are reflected as financing activities 
furthermore  monies received from banco ita in lieu of marketing activities result in a reduction of amounts owed to us as a result of not meeting the targets contained in our revised marketing agreement  since such amounts are considered revenues for purposes of 
table of contents calculating the targets 
as a result  we do not expect to receive material amounts from banco ita for its failure to meet these targets at the march measurement date 
cash used in operating activities in the fourth quarter of was million  a decrease of from million used in the fourth quarter of and an improvement of from million  in the third quarter of the improvement in cash used in operating activities was achieved largely through a reduction in our net loss from operations as a result of lower costs and expenses 
our ending cash and cash equivalents position of million at december  benefited from a payment from banco ita to the company in lieu of certain marketing activities 
we received million from banco ita in the fourth quarter 
we expect to continue to receive similar payments from banco ita in the future  although the amounts of these payments are expected to decrease 
the company expects cash utilization to increase modestly in the first quarter of  primarily as a result of seasonal working capital fluctuations 
in the year ended december   our operations required million to fund operating losses and activities and capital expenditures of million 
this was financed through the use of initial cash and cash equivalent balances on hand and through the issuance of million in senior convertible notes to time warner 
senior convertible notes on march   we entered into a note purchase agreement with time warner under which time warner made available to us million in exchange for our senior convertible notes due in march we completed the draw down of the funds available to us under the note purchase agreement on december  the senior convertible notes bear an annual coupon of  payable quarterly 
the initial conversion price  subject to adjustment  is per share a premium of to the closing trading price of our class a common stock of on march  
the senior convertible notes are convertible at any time at the option of the holder and are redeemable by us at any time  subject to the holder s right to convert the senior convertible notes into preferred stock 
in addition  the senior convertible notes are required to be repaid prior to maturity  at the option of the holder  in the event of significant asset sales or if we raise additional debt or equity funds 
interest is payable either in cash or preferred stock  at our option 
however  the interest payment on the final maturity date must be made in cash only 
if interest is paid in shares  the price per share is determined based on the average closing price of the class a common stock for the twenty trading dates ending two days prior to the date of payment 
on december   we made our quarterly payment of interest on the time warner notes  which covered the period from october through december  the interest payment of approximately million was made through the issuance of  shares of series b preferred stock to time warner  based on an average price of per share 
for the year ended december   we incurred million related to interest payable to time warner on the senior convertible notes and paid such interest through the issuance of  shares of series b preferred stock  as compared with million paid through the issuance of  shares of series b preferred stock for the year ended december  we expect to incur approximately million in annual interest expense as long as the full amount of million in senior convertible notes are outstanding 
given our focus on cash preservation  we expect to make future payments of interest through the issuance of additional shares of stock 
depending on market conditions at the time  a decision to pay the interest on the time warner notes through the issuance of additional shares could result in significant additional dilution to existing shareholders 
in the event the million in senior convertible notes were to be converted by time warner  an additional  shares of preferred stock would be issued to time warner  increasing the economic ownership by america online and its affiliates in aola to and their relative voting strength to  assuming conversion of the warrant granted to america online at the date of our initial public offering and the options granted to its employees who are members of our board of directors 
interest payments on the senior convertible notes over the remaining life of the notes will total approximately 
table of contents million  assuming the notes are not converted to stock prior to their maturity 
because we intend to pay interest through the issuance of additional shares of preferred stock  we expect time warner s and america online s relative ownership and voting strength to continue to increase over the foreseeable future 
time warner has granted us waivers for fiscal and related to our non compliance with an affirmative covenant in the senior convertible notes requiring our auditors to certify annually that we have not defaulted under the notes 
our auditors are not able to provide the certification because it would require them to certify our compliance with non quantitative matters 
we do not believe we will be able to obtain this certification in future years either 
moreover  there can be no assurance that we will receive this waiver for or receive additional waivers in future years from time warner or any other holder of the senior convertible notes for any non compliance by us under this covenant 
if we do not obtain waivers in future years  we will be in default under the notes and obligated to repay them immediately 
at this time  we do not have sufficient funds to repay the notes and we would suffer material adverse consequences to our business  financial condition and results of operations 
historical financing from inception through december   our operations have been financed through the issuance of senior convertible debt and through capital raised in several rounds of financing  including our initial public offering on august  funds raised through december  have totaled million  net of issuance related expenses  as shown in the following table net proceeds from historical financings in thousands total america time america online cisneros banco grand online warner time warner group ita public total pre ipo ipo march sr

in determining reporting segments  we internally reviewed the current management structure that reports to the chief operating decision maker and analyzed the reports received by that decision maker in order to allocate resources and measure performance

although amounts for argentina are not currently material and are not expected to be material in future reporting periods  we have decided not to consolidate argentina with our corporate and other segment in order to facilitate historical segment comparisons 
no single customer accounted for or more of our total revenues for any of the periods presented

table of contents fiscal compared to fiscal for the year ended december   our total consolidated revenues were million  a decrease of from million in the year ended december  the decrease was driven primarily by declines in brazil and mexico  which were partially offset by increases in puerto rico and corporate and other 
the decrease in total revenues was driven by declines in both revenue from subscriptions and revenue from advertising and other 
total revenues in in brazil  which remained our largest segment at of total revenues  fell by to million in  from million in the decrease was driven by reductions in both advertising and other revenue and lower subscription revenue 
currency devaluation reduced reported total revenues by million in  as compared with advertising and other revenue fell by million  or  in subscription revenue in brazil also declined by million  or  during the year 
the decrease in subscription revenue in brazil was driven by both the loss of paying membership and currency devaluation 
competition from low cost and free internet service providers in brazil during placed us at a pricing disadvantage that resulted in increased membership turnover  especially among members of our aola country service in brazil 
membership was also negatively impacted by a decrease in new member registration rates caused by the reduction in marketing activity from our closing of inefficient and unproductive kiosks at both banco ita and retail locations  and from the delays in the implementation of our mcdonald s marketing agreement 
in september  we launched our web based interactive services in brazil  in order to address certain of our competitive disadvantages  including pricing 
early indications are that the web based services will result in improved retention as compared with our aola country service in brazil  although there can be no assurance that this will continue 
the pricing of our web based services is lower than that of our aola country service 
consequently  revenue per member from the web based service will be lower 
furthermore  approximately of members to our web based services migrated from our aola country service 
our banco ita membership levels stabilized in the fourth quarter of  due primarily to the introduction of our web based services 
we do not yet know if the early indications of improvements in retention and banco ita membership achieved by our web based services will be sufficient to offset lost revenues from our aola country service in brazil  or be able to assist us in our goal to achieve operating cash self sufficiency 
for the year ended december   total revenues from mexico were million  a decrease of million  or  from million in the prior year 
mexico continued as our second largest segment in fiscal  accounting for of total revenues 
the decrease in total revenues from mexico was driven primarily by lower subscription revenue  which fell by approximately million  or from the prior year 
the decrease in subscription revenue was caused by a reduction in the number of paid members  and by an increase in the number of members choosing long term prepaid plans which are sold at a discount to our monthly  unlimited usage plan 
currency devaluation also reduced reported revenue from mexico by million  or 
advertising and other revenue in mexico also declined by approximately million  or by  to million in total revenues from puerto rico increased by to million in the year ended december   up from million in the prior year 
this increase was driven primarily by higher subscription revenue 
puerto rico accounted for of total revenues  as compared with of total revenues in puerto rico continued as our third largest segment in  although it increased its relative share of our total revenues 
our rate of increase in subscription revenue in puerto rico  however  decreased in from  as we believe we neared saturation of the premium tiered market segment in puerto rico 
we estimate that the premium tier of the puerto rican market represents of the total addressable market in puerto rico  and that we are market leaders in the premium segment 
we launched a web based product offering internet connectivity and minimal content and email features in february  which we hope will allow us to address the low cost segment of the puerto rican market 
we do not yet have an indication of consumer acceptance of our web based product in puerto rico or the extent of potential migration from the aol branded service in puerto rico

seasonality we expect subscriber registrations to be lower during the first and fourth calendar quarters  which is the summer season in brazil and argentina  and higher during our second and third calendar quarters  which is the winter season in these countries 
however  seasonality from the southern hemisphere countries has been offset by the counter balancing effects of mexico and puerto rico  which are in the northern hemisphere 
therefore  we have not experienced pronounced seasonality to date in our business 
critical accounting policies we believe the following represent our critical accounting policies as contemplated by frr for a summary of all our significant accounting policies  including the critical accounting policies discussed below  see note to our audited consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition for subscribers in brazil  mexico and argentina that have elected to pay their subscription fees with credit cards or through direct debit from bank accounts  we begin to recognize subscription revenues when the fees become due and are confirmed as collectible 
for subscribers in these countries who pay their subscription fees through cash payment mechanisms  we do not begin to recognize subscription revenues until the cash payment is received 
subscribers to the aol branded service in puerto rico pay their membership fees directly to america online 
revenue from subscribers in puerto rico  which is paid to us by america online  is recognized when the fees become due 
were we to begin to recognize fees from subscribers choosing cash payment options as revenue when they become due  our subscriber revenues and bad debt expense would be greater than currently reported 
as we continue to acquire additional experience with the collectibility of our cash accounts receivable  we may begin to recognize revenue when the fees become due  although we do not expect to do so in the near term future 
under our strategic alliance with banco ita  prior to december   banco ita was required to offer at least one hour of subsidized usage per month to subscribers of the co branded service following the expiration of a subscriber s trial period 
banco ita could also choose to provide additional subsidized time to its customers beyond the one hour obligation 
banco ita was also required to pay us a nominal amount for subscribers who had not used the service during the previous month and who were beyond their free trial period 
amounts paid to us by banco ita on behalf of its customers for subsidies that it chose or was required to make were recorded as a reduction of marketing expenses and not as subscriber revenues 
amounts paid directly to us by subscribers that exceeded the time subsidized by banco ita were included in subscription revenues 
were we to have recognized payments from banco ita as revenues  our subscriber revenues and sales and marketing expense would have been higher than reported 
under the terms of the revised marketing agreement  banco ita is not required to subsidize its customers  although it may choose to do so 
to the extent any additional customer subsidies are received from banco ita  we will continue to record such subsidies as reductions in marketing expenses 
subsidies from banco ita on behalf of its customers largely ceased in the second half of 
table of contents cost of revenues zero port costs we have entered into zero cost agreements with telecommunications companies who provide us with modem ports that are used by our customers to access our interactive services and the internet 
under these agreements  we provide the telecommunications providers with advertising in exchange for the rental fees of the ports 
we credit the value of the advertising we provide against our telecommunications expense in cost of revenues because we are not able to reliably determine the fair value of the ports under these arrangements 
as a consequence  our cost of revenues does not reflect any expense for ports provided to us under these arrangements 
were we able to value the fair value of the ports received  we would recognize incremental revenue for the value of the advertising provided 
we would also recognize expense for the value of the ports 
although the profit impact of this alternative treatment would be neutral  we would report both higher revenues and higher expense 
valuation of accounts receivable allowances for bad debt we estimate that the carrying amount of our trade accounts receivable  which are primarily from subscription fees and advertising and other revenues  approximate their fair market value 
this requires us to estimate the portion of accounts receivable that will ultimately be written off as uncollectible 
for this purpose  management maintains an allowance to provide for estimated credit losses and has the responsibility for determining that the allowance is adequate for probable and inherent losses relating to trade receivables at each reporting date 
although allowances for potential credit losses are determined based on historical experience  current evaluation of the composition of accounts receivable and expected credit trends  our short operating history makes prediction of actual credit losses difficult 
to the extent actual credit losses differ from our estimates of uncollectible accounts  the amounts we eventually collect will be adjusted to income in the period actually collected 
we recorded provisions to the allowance of approximately  in the year ended december   million in the year ended december  and million in the year ended december  write offs against the allowance totaled million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
as of december   we had a value added tax vat receivable from the argentine government of approximately million 
this receivable  which arose in the normal conduct of our business  is recoverable as we make sales in argentina and make collections from our customers 
given current economic conditions in argentina  the period of collection is likely to exceed five years 
were the government in argentina to dishonor its vat obligation  or force its exchange for securities of lower value  this could result in an impairment of the value of our vat asset 
we have not established any valuation allowance for this asset 
deferred tax assets deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between financial reporting and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we measure these taxes using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
given our history of operating losses  we have significant tax loss carry forward assets that we have fully reserved to reduce their carrying value to zero 
were we to determine that such assets were eventually to be utilized  we would reverse the related valuation allowances and recognize a benefit related to these assets 
stock based compensation accounting for stock options aola follows sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  as amended by sfas no 
 which established a fair value based method of accounting for stock based compensation plans and encourages entities to adopt that method of accounting for their employee stock compensation plans 
this pronouncement also allows an entity to continue to measure compensation cost 
table of contents for those plans based on accounting principles board apb opinion no 
apb  accounting for stock issued to employees and disclose the pro forma net income and net income per share as if the fair value method had been applied in measuring cost 
compensation cost is determined based on the intrinsic value of the stock options as required by the provisions of apb and is recognized when probable  based on the best estimate of the outcome of the performance condition 
aola has elected to apply apb in accounting for its stock plan 
accordingly  as a result of applying the intrinsic value method of accounting to stock options we have issued  no compensation expense has been recognized for options granted with an exercise price equal to market value at the date of grant 
total expense recognized in relation to the granting of stock options issued below market price was limited to approximately  in the year ended december    in the year ended december   and  in the year ended december   related to an options grant issued to our chief executive officer 
had we accounted for stock options issued to our employees using the fair value method  we would have had a stock based compensation credit of  in the year ended december   and a stock based compensation expense of million and million in the years ending december  and  respectively 
forward looking statements this report and other oral and written statements made by us to the public contain forward looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of the forward looking statements are based on management s current expectations or beliefs and are subject to a number of factors and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward looking statements 
such statements address the following subjects efforts to improve the quality of our membership base and the results of those efforts  migration of members from our aola country services to our web based interactive services  the expectation that our web based interactive services will or will not become our primary product offering in particular markets  future membership levels  future revenues  the benefits we expect to receive from our strategic alliance with banco ita and our amended marketing agreement with mcdonald s in brazil  the expected implementation of our amended marketing agreement with mcdonald s in brazil  future marketing efforts  future cost of revenues and future costs and expenses  future losses  the method of payment of interest on the time warner notes and the amount of such dividends  the method of redemption of our preferred stock  our expectation that current cash on hand will be sufficient to fund operations into the first quarter of  expected improvements and expansion of telecommunication services and infrastructure in latin america  pricing of telephone services and related regulations in latin america  our ability to effectively compete  penalties and other payments we expect to receive from banco ita  the effect of material firm operating commitments on our liquidity and cash flows  america online s and time warner s future ownership levels and voting strength  the expected impact of current legal proceedings  margins for our broadband product offering  future payments to related parties  future changes in telecommunications legislation in latin america and the impact of such changes  our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations  and america online s ability to protect our intellectual property rights and the adequacy of our network infrastructure 
risk factors the following factors  among others  could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward looking statements we have experienced substantial losses and we may not achieve or maintain profitability or sustain our business we incurred cumulative net operating losses of approximately million from december   the date of our inception  through december  we expect to continue to incur additional losses 
we cannot predict what impact  if any  continued losses will have on our ability to finance and sustain our operations in the future 
we will need to generate significant revenues to achieve profitability and we may not be able to do so 

table of contents if our membership base continues to decrease  our short term liquidity will be negatively impacted 
our liquidity over the next year will be dependent upon maintaining our membership base 
if our membership turnover increases and our membership base decreases  our short term liquidity will be negatively impacted 
because america online  time warner  the cisneros group and banco ita do not have any commitment to fund our future capital requirements  if we are unable to obtain additional financing from them or other sources  we may be unable to sustain our business we anticipate that our cash on hand will be sufficient to fund operations only into the first quarter of  based upon our current operating budget 
in addition  in march  we will require million to repay our senior convertible notes 
our principal stockholders have no obligation to provide additional financing to cover our future needs and time warner has stated that it does not plan to provide us with additional funding 
furthermore  time warner is not obligated to refinance our senior convertible notes 
there can be no assurance that additional funding can be obtained from other parties on favorable terms  or if at all 
if additional financing were to be obtained through the sale of additional equity or debt securities  or by entering into a credit facility  there is no assurance that the holders of the senior convertible notes issued to time warner will not require the proceeds of any such financing to be used to repay the senior convertible notes 
to the extent that the holders of the senior convertible notes require the proceeds of any such financing to be used to repay the senior convertible notes  the funds would not be available for use by the company 
any additional equity financing  if available  may be dilutive to our stockholders  and any debt financing  if available  may involve restrictions on our financing and operating activities 
america online  time warner and the cisneros group control our company  may have interests that conflict with the interests of class a common stockholders and are free to place their interests ahead of those stockholders because america online time warner and the cisneros group operate in the interactive services and media industries  their current control of approximately  and  respectively  of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock  creates actual and potential conflicts of interest between them and us 
neither our restated certificate of incorporation nor our agreements with america online  time warner and the cisneros group prevent them from pursuing other opportunities that might be disadvantageous to us  acquiring a minority interest in businesses that compete with us or  in some instances  directly competing with us 
consequently  they each have the power to take actions that may be directly opposed to our interests and the interests of the class a common stockholders 
if we are not able to convert our subscribers into paying subscribers  or are unable to retain paying subscribers  we will not be able to increase our revenues we have had difficulty in converting trial subscribers and subscribers who choose non credit card payment options into subscribers who pay on a timely basis 
in addition  the turnover rate for our paying subscribers continues at very high levels 
if we fail to successfully convert trial and non credit card payment subscribers  or if we fail to retain paying subscribers  we will have difficulty increasing our revenues and reducing our operating losses 
historically  a substantial majority of our subscribers who have chosen non credit card payment methods have not made payments on their accounts following the end of their free trial periods or have not made timely payment 
because our marketing efforts generally include offering a free trial period to our subscribers  significant portions of our subscribers are in their free trial period 

table of contents reduced marketing expenditures may negatively impact our ability to attract new members in and  we significantly reduced our marketing expenditures in an effort to conserve available cash and to target higher value members 
these reduced expenditures may hamper our ability to attract new members and grow our business 
if our relationship with banco ita is not successful  our reputation  financial condition and competitive position may be harmed our revised strategic marketing alliance with banco ita is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties 
we issued  shares of our class a common stock to banco ita on august  if we are unable to receive the expected benefits from this alliance  our business could suffer 
for example if we and banco ita are not successful in attracting a significant number of subscribers  or if these subscribers do not choose to pay for the service  we will not achieve the revenue levels that we expect 
if we and banco ita disagree on the direction of the alliance  it is unlikely we will fully recover the value of the shares issued to banco ita 
because our agreement with banco ita severely limits our ability to enter into strategic relationships with other financial institutions in brazil  we may be unable to take advantage of potentially lucrative business opportunities 
because we and banco ita are marketing a co branded service  if banco ita experiences any financial difficulties or negative publicity for any reason  our reputation and financial condition could be adversely affected 
if we are unable to implement our marketing agreement with mcdonald s in brazil in a timely and effective manner  our membership may not grow our marketing efforts and our future membership growth are heavily dependent on the successful implementation of our mcdonald s marketing agreement in brazil 
if we are not able to implement this agreement in a timely or effective manner  we may not be able to increase our future membership and revenues 
to date  this agreement has been subject to a number of delays and we have paid mcdonald s a total of million 
this agreement has been in effect since january  and we do not expect to complete implementation until the first quarter of we recently restructured our agreement with mcdonald s in a manner which we hope will facilitate the implementation of the project in a more timely and effective manner 
if we are unable to effectively implement this agreement  we may not recover the value of our current and projected future investment in the project 
intense competition in latin america  including competition from providers of free and low cost internet services  may adversely affect our ability to generate revenues and acquire market share we compete in a marketplace with a wide range of competitors  including providers of online and internet access services and portals 
competition is intense and may increase  which could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues and acquire market share 
furthermore  providers of free internet access in brazil have continued to attract significant numbers of new users 
we compete with providers of spanish and portuguese language interactive services  including internet access services  portals  search engines and web directories 
we compete in the broader latin american regional market as well as in country specific local markets 
our principal regional market competitors include terra lycos  an affiliate of telef nica  and microsoft msn 
our primary local competitors in our core target countries include uol and free services provided by internet gratis ig  super and ibest in brazil  telmex in mexico  which has an alliance with microsoft for the development of content and offers a prodigy branded service  ciudad internet and arnet  which is owned by telecom  
table of contents in argentina  and puerto rico telephone company  at t  earthlink and juno in puerto rico 
there are currently many other internet access providers in latin america 
some of our competitors and potential future competitors may have the following advantages longer operating histories  greater name recognition in some markets  better access to capital and larger established customer bases 
our competitors may develop interactive services that achieve greater market acceptance and new competitors may emerge and acquire significant market share 
further  competitors that own or have established alliances with cable  satellite or telecommunications companies may have distribution  technical or financial advantages  including the ability to offer internet access services at lower prices or for free 
if consumers do not respond favorably to our web based services  our business will suffer in  we began to introduce web based services  which differ from our country services in that they do not require client software and are generally lower priced 
price  member retention and profitability targets may not prove feasible 
external factors  such as the development of competitive alternatives and competitor responses  may impact consumer acceptance of these new services 
our business is heavily dependent on consumer acceptance of these new services 
if america online and the cisneros group fail to agree on matters related to our business  our business may be adversely affected for as long as they remain in deadlock because america online and the cisneros group jointly control us through provisions contained in our restated certificate of incorporation  restated by laws  and stockholders agreement  either america online or the cisneros group can block a wide variety of actions  including marketing activities  budgetary authorizations and changing significant corporate governance provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and restated by laws 
our potential issuance of stock upon the conversion of our convertible debt  our payment of interest under the notes in additional stock  and our expected redemption of preferred stock will cause substantial dilution and may depress the price of our class a common stock the conversion of the senior convertible notes and or the payment of interest on the senior convertible notes in stock will result in substantial dilution to the interests of our class a stockholders and could decrease the price of our stock 
a decline in the price of our class a common stock could encourage short sales of our class a stock  which could place further downward pressure on the price of our stock 
additionally  under the terms of our revised charter  on august   we must redeem approximately of the then outstanding series b and c preferred stock issued to america online and the cisneros group 
the exact percentage to be redeemed is subject to adjustment based on the number of shares we will issue in payment of interest on our senior convertible notes through august   which is in turn dependent on the price of our class a common stock 
the series b and series c preferred stock may be redeemed  at our option  in cash  by delivery of shares of class a common stock or by any combination of cash and shares of class a common stock 
however  due to our limited cash position  we expect to redeem these shares of preferred stock through the issuance of shares of class a common stock 
this will result in significant additional dilution to our class a stockholders 
volatile economic  social and political conditions in latin america could make it difficult for us to develop our business  generate revenues or achieve or sustain profitability economic  social and political conditions in latin america are volatile 
this volatility could make it difficult for us to develop our business  generate revenues or achieve or sustain profitability 
historically  volatility has been caused by currency devaluations  significant governmental influence over many aspects of local economies  political and economic instability  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  social unrest or violence  slow or negative economic growth  imposition of trade barriers  and wage and 
table of contents price controls 
most of these factors were significant factors impacting our business during the fiscal years  and and have occurred at various times over the last two decades in the latin american markets in which we operate  including brazil  mexico and argentina 
we have no control over these matters 
social  political and economic conditions may inhibit online services and internet use  create uncertainty in our operating climate and cause advertisers to reduce their advertising spending  all of which may adversely impact our business 
in the past  our revenues have been impacted by devaluation of local currencies 
because most of our revenues are paid in latin american currencies  our reported revenues decline as these currencies depreciate relative to the us dollar although our reporting currency is the us dollar  most of our revenues are received in the currencies of the countries in which we offer our interactive services 
the currencies of many latin american countries  including brazil  mexico and argentina  have experienced substantial volatility and depreciation in the past 
our revenues will decline in value if the local currencies in which we are paid depreciate relative to the us dollar  which would adversely affect our business 
because america online and the cisneros group control our ability to offer new types of interactive services  our revenues  growth and ability to compete may be adversely affected because of restrictions and limitations in our charter documents  we may not be able to respond quickly  or at all  to new services offered by competitors or take advantage of new business opportunities  which could adversely affect our growth or reduce our revenues 
first  we cannot engage in any business activity other than providing pc based and aol branded tv and wireless based interactive services in latin america without the approval of america online and the cisneros group for as long as i america online continues to own at least  shares of b stock  or of the number of shares of series b preferred stock that we originally issued to it  and ii the cisneros group continues to own at least  shares of c stock  or of the number of shares of series c preferred stock that we originally issued to it and two of our directors and one of our executive officers 
second  even if america online acquires or develops aol branded wireless based online services  we will not be able to offer these services or aol branded tv services in latin america  although we have the license to do so  without the approval of both of the directors appointed by america online and the cisneros group who serve on the special committee of our board of directors 
disputes may also arise with america online over whether our licensed rights extend to particular services  due to possible ambiguities in the terms pc based  tv based and wireless based services 
also  we are prevented from offering our services to spanish and portuguese speaking consumers in countries outside of latin america 
limitations and conditions on our rights to offer aol branded online services and portals in latin america could harm the value of these rights and our ability to effectively compete we have entered into a license agreement with america online under which we have exclusive rights to offer aol branded pc based online services and  as they are developed by america online  aol branded tv and wireless based online services in latin america 
these rights to use america online s brand name and services are vital to our success as an interactive services provider 
however  they are subject to important conditions and limitations  some of which are beyond our control  which could preclude us from exercising our rights or materially diminish their value to us and could adversely affect our business 
first  we have no rights to offer aol branded wireless based online services unless the services are developed by america online for commercial launch before august  second  we will lose our exclusivity i to aol branded pc based online services upon the date on which either america online or the cisneros group owns or less of our outstanding capital stock as of august   and ii to aol branded tv and wireless based online services  upon the later of august  or the date on 
table of contents which either america online or the cisneros group owns or less of the outstanding capital stock of aola 
third  america online may terminate our license agreement if we materially breach its terms 
fourth  our license to offer a network of spanish and portuguese language aol branded portals in latin america is non exclusive 
except for the compuserve classic branded services  we have no rights to market non aol branded interactive services owned by america online  including netscape  mapquest and moviefone 
these limitations may prevent us from pursuing potentially lucrative business opportunities 
if the telecommunications networks we use are not reliable or are not able to accommodate our anticipated needs  the quality of our online services and our ability to make our online services available to our members would be harmed we depend entirely upon third party telecommunications network providers to transmit data between america online s servers in the us and our members and content providers in brazil  mexico and argentina 
if these third party telecommunications networks do not function properly  the quality of our online services  or even our ability to deliver our online services  would be compromised  which would adversely affect our business 
our primary areas of concern involve the capacity and reliability of these networks 
if our third party network providers lack the capacity to accommodate a rapid increase in use of our online services  members may encounter delays in accessing and using our online services 
in addition  if our third party telecommunications network providers experience severe financial difficulties  our service could be interrupted 
past and future media coverage could adversely affect consumer acceptance of our interactive services  which could negatively impact our ability to acquire market share and generate revenues the interactive services industry  including our company  experiences heightened media coverage 
past and future media coverage of our company and our interactive services could adversely affect consumer acceptance of our interactive services 
our servers  which are owned and maintained by america online  may be subject to system failures  computer viruses or other unanticipated problems that may damage our reputation and result in a loss of members and in a decrease in use of our portals any damage to or failure of america online s servers could adversely impact our business 
the host computers that run our interactive services  which we refer to as our servers  are owned and maintained by america online in three locations within the us our operations  therefore  depend entirely on america online s ability to protect this equipment and the information stored there against events such as damage by fire  power loss  failures by third party service providers  computer viruses and unauthorized intrusions 
we may not be able to retain or recruit qualified personnel  which could impact the management and development of our business our success depends in part upon both the continued services of our executive officers and other key employees and our ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified personnel 
the loss of the services of one or more of our key personnel could adversely impact our business 
since competition for talented people is intense  we may have difficulty in retaining and attracting skilled and qualified personnel 
if we fail to adapt our online services to accommodate faster methods of internet access or if we fail to offer new technologies  we may lose members or fail to attract new members and our revenues may decline unless we can accommodate high speed internet and online service access  new technologies  such as tv and wireless based services  and operating system platforms other than windows  windows  windows me and windows xp  our interactive services will be less appealing to consumers and our 
table of contents revenues may decline 
we expect high speed internet and online service access to become more widely available in latin america 
we will be at a competitive disadvantage if we cannot allow our members to connect to our online services at these higher speeds or over new technologies 
to date  we only offer high speed internet access services in brazil 
we may become subject to burdensome government regulations affecting interactive services  which could increase our costs of doing business or impair our ability to generate revenues the legal and regulatory environment that pertains to interactive services in latin america remains uncertain and may change 
latin american countries may adopt laws and regulations or apply existing laws to interactive services  including online service and internet advertising 
uncertainty and new regulations could increase our costs  prevent us from delivering our interactive services and slow the growth of the internet significantly  which could delay growth in demand for our interactive services and limit our ability to generate revenues 
new and existing laws and the interpretation of existing laws may cover issues such as copyright  trademark and patent infringement  access to networks  sales and other taxes  content provided on our services  user privacy and data protection  pricing controls and cross border commerce 
because our licensed rights to america online s trademarks and domain names are a valuable asset and integral to our brand identity  unauthorized use of intellectual property that we license from america online could lead to public confusion about our brand and adversely affect our business america online s or our own inability to protect our licensed rights to america online s trademarks and domain names against infringement or misappropriation could lead to public confusion about our brand and adversely affect our business 
for example  america online experienced difficulty in obtaining the rights to the domain name www 
aol 
com 
br in brazil 
similarly  in brazil  mexico and argentina  america online has initiated opposition proceedings to prevent registration of marks by third parties that are confusingly similar to america online s marks 
we cannot assure that america online will prevail in any legal proceedings or be able to register successfully all of the domain names that relate to its trademarks 
because credit card penetration in latin america is limited  our ability to attract members who pay on a timely basis may be affected credit card penetration in the markets we serve in latin america is significantly lower than in the united states 
this limits the number of potential subscribers to our aola country services who could pay by credit card 
we have had difficulty collecting payments from subscribers who pay by means other than credit cards 
in the past  we have had difficulty complying with certain nasdaq listing requirements 
if we are not able to satisfy the continued listing requirements of the nasdaq smallcap market  our class a common stock could be delisted resulting in reduced liquidity for our stockholders and possible lower stock price in the past  we have had difficulty complying with various nasdaq listing requirements 
if our stock were delisted from the nasdaq smallcap market  our stockholders could have reduced liquidity and the price of our stock could decrease 
we have a number of arrangements with telecommunications network providers that have not been executed and these providers could modify the terms of these arrangements at any time we have several arrangements with telecommunications providers that have not been memorialized in written contracts 
as a result  these telecommunication providers could change the terms under which they provide service to us or terminate their relationship with us at any time 
in addition  a change in 
table of contents telecommunications regulations could encourage these providers to change the terms under which they provide service or terminate their relationships with us 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our reporting currency is the us dollar 
however  most of our revenues are received in the currencies of the countries in which we offer our interactive services 
the currencies of many latin american countries  including brazil  mexico and argentina  have experienced substantial volatility  including prolonged periods of devaluation  in the past 
if the currencies of the countries in which we operate depreciate and we do not or are unable to increase our prices  our revenues from our services will decline in us dollar terms 
due to our constantly changing currency exposure and the potential substantial volatility of currency exchange rates  we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on our business 
however  we believe that to the extent that we have substantial expenses in each of our principal currencies  our exposure to currency fluctuations will be reduced 
therefore  to date  we have not tried to limit our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations by using foreign currency forward exchange contracts as a vehicle for hedging 
our business may be adversely affected as a result of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations if we fail to enter into economic hedging transactions 
future currency exchange losses may be increased if we become subject to exchange control regulations restricting our ability to convert local currencies into us dollars 
as of december   we had total assets in argentina totaling approximately million  of which approximately million is related to a local currency denominated vat receivable from the argentine government 
this vat receivable is classified under other assets in the consolidated balance sheet 
this vat receivable is not subject to expiration 
to date  our consolidated results of operations have not been materially impacted by inflation 
inflation was approximately in brazil during calendar and is expected to reach a similar level in calendar inflation in argentina was approximately during calendar  and is expected increase slightly to in calendar as the argentine economy has resumed growth after devaluing its currency in inflation in mexico was in and is forecasted to reach a similar level in we are exposed to market risk as it relates to changes in the market value of our investments 
as of december   we did not have any material investments in marketable securities
