critical accounting policies and estimates the company believes the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
there have been no changes in judgments or estimates that had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements for the periods presented 
revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts the company recognizes revenue from rental operations in the period in which the services are provided 
direct sale revenue is recognized in the period in which the product is shipped 
judgments and estimates are used in determining the collectability of accounts receivable 
the company analyzes specific accounts receivable and historical bad debt experience  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and the age of outstanding balances when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
management judgments and estimates are used in connection with establishing the allowance in any accounting period 
changes in estimates are reflected in the period they become known 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of bad debt expense recognition for any given period if management makes different judgments or utilizes different estimates 
inventories and rental merchandise in service inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value  net of any reserve for excess and obsolete inventory 
judgments and estimates are used in determining the likelihood that new goods on hand can be sold to customers or used in rental operations 
historical inventory usage and current revenue trends are considered in estimating both excess and obsolete inventories 
if actual product demand and market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
the company uses the last in  first out lifo method to value a significant portion of its inventories 
substantially all inventories represent finished goods 
rental merchandise in service is being amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated service lives of the merchandise  which range from to months 
in establishing estimated lives for merchandise in service  management considers historical experience and the intended use of the merchandise 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of operating profit for any period if management makes different judgments or utilizes different estimates 
goodwill  intangibles and other long lived assets the company adopted sfas no 
effective august  under sfas no 
 goodwill is no longer amortized 
sfas also requires that companies test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and when events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit to which goodwill is assigned below its carrying amount 
our evaluation considers changes in the operating environment  competitive information  market trends  operating performance and cash flow modeling 
management completes its annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and there have been no impairments of goodwill or definite lived intangible assets in fiscal  or future events could cause management to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill and other intangibles associated with acquired businesses are impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
property  plant and equipment and definite lived intangible assets are depreciated or amortized over their useful lives 
useful lives are based on management estimates of the period that the assets will generate revenue 
long lived assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate an asset may be impaired 
insurance the company self insures for certain obligations related to health  workers compensation  vehicles and general liability programs 
the company also purchases stop loss insurance policies to protect it from catastrophic losses 
judgments and estimates are used in determining the potential value associated with reported claims and for losses that have occurred  but have not been reported 
the company s estimates consider historical claim experience and other factors 
the company s liabilities are based on estimates  and  while the company believes that the accrual for loss is adequate  the ultimate liability may be in excess of or less than the amounts recorded 
changes in claim experience  the company s ability to settle claims or other estimates and judgments used by management could have a material impact on the amount and timing of expense for any period 
environmental and other contingencies the company is subject to legal proceedings and claims arising from the conduct of their business operations  including environmental matters  personal injury  customer contract matters  and or employment claims 
accounting principles generally accepted in the united states require that a liability for contingencies be recorded when it is probable that a liability has occurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
significant judgment is required to determine the existence of a liability  as well as the amount to be recorded 
the company regularly consults with attorneys and outside consultants to ensure that all of the relevant facts and circumstances are considered  before a contingent liability is recorded 
the company records accruals for environmental and other contingencies based on enacted laws  regulatory orders or decrees  the company s estimates of costs  insurance proceeds  participation by other parties and the timing of payments  and the input of outside consultants and attorneys 
the estimated liability for environmental contingencies has been discounted using a credit adjusted risk free rate of interest of over periods ranging from ten to thirty years 
the estimated current costs  net of legal settlements with insurance carriers  have been adjusted for the estimated impact of inflation at per year 
changes in enacted laws  regulatory orders or decrees  management s estimates of costs  insurance proceeds  participation by other parties and the timing of payments  and the input of outside consultants and attorneys could have a material impact on the amounts recorded for environmental and other contingent liabilities 
income taxes the company s policy of accounting for income taxes is in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for income taxes 
deferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences between amounts recognized for income tax and financial reporting purposes at currently enacted tax rates

these reviews include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
in evaluating the exposure associated with various filing positions  the company records estimated reserves for probable exposures  in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for contingencies

 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no

under the new accounting method  the company now recognizes asset retirement obligations in the period in which they are incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset 
the company will depreciate  on a straight line basis  the amount added to property and equipment and recognize accretion expense in connection with the discounted liability over the various remaining lives which range from approximately one to thirty years 
the estimated liability has been based on historical experience in decommissioning nuclear laundry facilities  estimated useful lives of the underlying assets  external vendor estimates as to the cost to decommission these assets in the future and federal and state regulatory requirements 
the estimated current costs have been adjusted for the estimated impact of inflation at per year 
the liability has been discounted using credit adjusted risk free rates that range from approximately over one to thirty years 
revisions to the liability could occur due to changes in the company s estimated useful lives of the underlying assets  estimated dates of decommissioning  changes in decommissioning costs  changes in federal or state regulatory guidance on the decommissioning of such facilities  or other changes in estimates 
changes due to revised estimates will be recognized by increasing or decreasing the carrying amount of the liability and the carrying amount of the related long lived asset if the assets are still in service or charged to expense in the period if the assets are no longer in service

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk management has determined that all of the company s foreign subsidiaries operate primarily in local currencies that represent the functional currencies of the subsidiaries 
all assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars using the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date  while income and expense accounts are translated at average exchange rates during the year 
as such  the company s operating results are affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar as compared to currencies in foreign countries  as a result of the company s transactions in these foreign markets 
the company does not operate a hedging program to mitigate the effect of a significant rapid change in the value of the canadian dollar  euro  british pound  or mexican peso as compared to the us dollar 
if such a change did occur  the company would have to take into account a currency exchange gain or loss in the amount of the change in the us dollar denominated balance of the amounts outstanding at the time of such change 
while the company does not believe such a gain or loss is likely  and would not likely be material  there can be no assurance that such a loss would not have an adverse material effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
interest rate risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates which may adversely affect its financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
in seeking to minimize the risks from interest rate fluctuations  the company manages exposures through its regular operating and financing activities 
the company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily through its borrowings under its million amended credit agreement with a syndicate of banks and its million of floating rate notes with a group of insurance companies 
under both agreements  the company borrows funds at variable interest rates based on the eurodollar rate or libor rates 
as of august   the company s outstanding debt approximates its carrying value 
the company entered into a million interest rate swap agreement to manage its exposure to movements in interest rates on its variable rate debt 
this swap agreement  which expired in october  effectively changed the variable rate to a fixed rate 
changes in the fair value of the swap agreement have been charged to the company s consolidated statement of income in the period of change in fair value 
the company is evaluating alternatives to manage its exposure to movements in interest rates on its variable rate debt borrowing agreements and the floating rate notes
