item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our consolidated results of operations and cash flows for the years ended december   and and consolidated financial condition as of december  and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this document 
overview we are a diversified spanish language media company with a unique portfolio of television  radio and outdoor advertising assets  reaching approximately of all hispanics in the united states 
as discussed further below  we sold our publishing operations on july  following this disposition  we now operate in three reportable segments television broadcasting  radio broadcasting and outdoor advertising 
as of the date of filing this report  we own and or operate primary television stations that are located primarily in the southwestern united states 
we own and or operate radio stations fm and am located primarily in arizona  california  colorado  florida  nevada  new mexico and texas 
our outdoor advertising segment consists of approximately  advertising faces located primarily in los angeles and new york 
the comparability of our results between  and is significantly affected by acquisitions and dispositions in those periods 
we generate revenue from sales of national and local advertising time on television and radio stations and advertising on our billboards 
advertising rates are  in large part  based on each medium s ability to attract audiences in demographic groups targeted by advertisers 
we recognize advertising revenue when commercials are broadcast and when outdoor advertising services are provided 
we do not obtain long term commitments from our advertisers and  consequently  they may cancel  reduce or postpone orders without penalties 
we pay commissions to agencies for local  regional and national advertising 
for contracts directly with agencies  we record commissions as deductions from gross revenue 
seasonal revenue fluctuations are common in the broadcasting and outdoor advertising industries and are due primarily to variations in advertising expenditures by both local and national advertisers 
our primary expenses are employee compensation  including commissions paid to our sales staffs and our national representative firms  marketing  promotion and selling  technical  local programming  engineering and general and administrative 
our local programming costs for television consist of costs related to producing a local newscast in most of our markets 
highlights despite the war with iraq and a relatively weak economic environment  we experienced growth for the year ended december   with net revenue of million 
of that amount  revenue generated by our television segment accounted for  revenue generated by our radio segment accounted for and revenue generated by our outdoor segment accounted for 
we made several key acquisitions during  most notably the three fm radio stations in the los angeles market that we acquired from big city radio  inc those stations were successfully integrated into our existing los angeles radio operations  and by mid year we had already exceeded the arbitron ratings that we originally had only hoped to reach by year end in the market 
our radio division as a whole also posted strong results despite the departure from our company of a popular spanish language radio personality  and we successfully moved the headquarters of our radio network from campbell  california to los angeles  the nation s largest hispanic market and the heart of the us entertainment industry 
consistent with our strategy of focusing on core media assets  we completed the sale of our publishing operations in july 
we also finished the year with a ratio of net debt to ebitda as adjusted of to  despite our acquisition of the los angeles radio assets earlier in the year 
in addition  we made improvements in managing our expenses in by completing a rigorous budgeting process to reduce operating costs and overhead 
on the other hand  there were factors that limited our growth in  and which represent both challenges and opportunities looking ahead to foremost among these factors was the weak economy for most of  but we are encouraged by the national recovery that appeared to take hold during the later part of the year 
we were also relatively disappointed by the performance by our outdoor segment in we have responded to this challenge by making high level changes in our outdoor management and sales staff  and we intend to monitor developments closely during this transitional period 
in addition  although we experienced significant ratings gains in the los angeles radio market during  one of our key goals for will be to accelerate revenue growth in that market commensurate with our ratings success 

table of contents acquisitions and dispositions during  we acquired six television stations five in santa barbara  california and one in hartford  connecticut for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
we also acquired a permit to build a new low power television station in san diego  california for approximately million 
additionally  on january  we entered into a time brokerage agreement with big city radio  which allowed us to operate three radio stations in the greater los angeles market prior to our acquisition of those three stations 
on april   we consummated our purchase of substantially all of the assets of those three stations for million in cash and  shares of our class a common stock 
for purposes of allocating the purchase price  the class a common stock issued to big city radio was valued at approximately million  based on a five day average closing price around the announcement date of the acquisition 
we evaluated the transferred set of activities  assets  inputs and processes from each of these acquisitions and determined that the items excluded were significant and that each of these acquisitions was not considered a business 
on july   we sold substantially all of the assets and certain specified liabilities related to our publishing segment to cpk nyc  llc for aggregate consideration of approximately million  consisting of million in cash and an unsecured  subordinated five year note in the principal amount of million see note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
we used the cash proceeds from this disposition to repay a portion of the indebtedness then outstanding under our bank credit facility 
as a result of our decision to sell our publishing operations  our consolidated financial statements for all periods presented have been adjusted to reflect the publishing operations as discontinued operations and publishing assets and liabilities as held for sale or assignment  as the case may be  in accordance with sfas no 
relationship with univision univision currently owns approximately of our common stock on a fully converted basis 
in connection with its merger with hispanic broadcasting corporation in september  univision entered into an agreement with the us department of justice  or doj  pursuant to which univision agreed  among other things  to sell enough of its holdings of our stock so that its ownership of our company will not exceed by march  and by march  also pursuant to univision s agreement with doj  in september univision exchanged all of its shares of our class a and class c common stock that it previously owned for shares of our new series u preferred stock 
this exchange does not change univision s overall equity interest in our company  nor does it have any impact on our existing television station affiliation agreements with univision 
the series u preferred stock has limited voting rights  does not include the right to elect directors and is automatically convertible into shares of our class a common stock in connection with any transfer to a third party that is not an affiliate of univision 
the series u preferred stock is also mandatorily convertible into common stock when and if we create a new class of common stock that generally has the same rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions as the series u preferred stock other than the nominal liquidation preference 
we anticipate creating such a new class of common stock during the second quarter of  subject to obtaining stockholder approval at our annual meeting of stockholders scheduled to be held on may  
table of contents results of operations separate financial data for each of our operating segments is provided below 
segment operating profit loss is defined as operating profit loss before corporate expenses and non cash stock based compensation 
for the statement of operations for the year ended december   certain corporate expenses have been reclassified as direct operating expenses or selling  general and administrative expenses 
reclassifications have been made in prior years to be consistent with the current year presentation 
we evaluate the performance of our operating segments based on the following years ended december  change to change to net revenue television radio outdoor consolidated direct operating expenses television radio outdoor consolidated selling  general and administrative expenses television radio outdoor consolidated depreciation and amortization television radio outdoor consolidated segment operating profit loss television radio outdoor consolidated corporate expenses loss gain on sale of assets non cash stock based compensation operating income loss broadcast cash flow television radio outdoor consolidated ebitda as adjusted capital expenditures television radio outdoor consolidated total assets television radio outdoor assets helds for sale consolidated 
table of contents percentage not meaningful 
broadcast cash flow means operating income loss before corporate expenses  loss gain on sale of assets  depreciation and amortization and non cash stock based compensation 
ebitda as adjusted means broadcast cash flow less corporate expenses 
we use the term ebitda as adjusted because that measure does not include non cash stock based compensation 
we evaluate and project the liquidity and cash flows of our business using several measures  including broadcast cash flow and ebitda as adjusted 
we consider these measures as important indicators of liquidity relating to our operations  as they eliminate the effects of non cash loss on sale of assets  non cash depreciation and amortization and non cash stock based compensation awards 
we use these measures to evaluate liquidity and cash flow improvement from year to year as they eliminate non cash expense items 
we believe that our investors should use these measures because they may provide a better comparability of our liquidity to that of our competitors 
our calculation of ebitda as adjusted included herein is substantially similar to the measures used in the financial covenants included in our bank credit facility and in the indenture governing our senior subordinated notes 
in those instruments  ebitda as adjusted is referred to as operating cash flow and consolidated cash flow  respectively 
under our bank credit facility as currently amended  we cannot incur additional indebtedness if the incurrence of such indebtedness would result in our ratio of net debt to operating cash flow having exceeded to on a pro forma basis for the prior full four quarters 
under the indenture  the corresponding ratio of net indebtedness to consolidated cash flow cannot exceed to on the same basis 
the actual ratios of net indebtedness to each of operating cash flow and consolidated cash flow were as follows in each case for the year ended december  to   to  and  to we entered into the bank credit facility in september and issued our senior subordinated notes in march  so we were not subject to the same calculations and covenants in prior years 
for consistency of presentation  however  the foregoing historical ratios assume that our current definitions had been applied for all periods 
while we and many in the financial community consider broadcast cash flow and ebitda as adjusted to be important  they should be considered in addition to  but not as a substitute for or superior to  other measures of liquidity and financial performance prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  such as cash flows from operating activities  operating income and net income 
in addition  our definitions of broadcast cash flow and ebitda as adjusted differ from those of many companies reporting similarly named measures 
broadcast cash flow and ebitda as adjusted are non gaap measures 
the most directly comparable gaap financial measure to each of broadcast cash flow and ebitda as adjusted is net income loss 
a reconciliation of these non gaap measures to net income loss follows unaudited  in thousands years ended december  broadcast cash flow corporate expenses ebitda as adjusted loss gain on sale of assets non cash stock based compensation depreciation and amortization operating income loss interest expense interest income loss before income taxes income tax benefit expense loss before equity in net earnings of nonconsolidated affiliates equity in net earnings of nonconsolidated affiliates loss before discontinued operations gain on disposal of discontinued operations income loss from discontinued operations net income loss

the increase from these segments was attributable to increased advertising sold referred to as inventory in our industry  increased rates for that inventory  revenue associated with our acquisitions and increased revenue due to a full year of operations of our acquisitions 
the overall increase in net revenue was partially offset by a decrease in revenue from our outdoor segment of million 
we currently anticipate that a full year of operations from our acquisitions will contribute to an overall increase in our net revenue for we also currently anticipate that the number of advertisers purchasing spanish language advertising will continue to rise and will result in greater demand for our inventory 
we expect that this increased demand will  in turn  allow us to increase our rates  resulting in continued increases in net revenue in future periods

as a percentage of net revenue  direct operating expenses decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  direct operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue decreased because direct operating expense increases were outpaced by higher increases in net revenue 
we currently anticipate that  as our net revenue increases in future periods  our direct operating expenses correspondingly will continue to increase

selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   an increase of million

as a percentage of net revenue  selling  general and administrative expenses remained unchanged at for the year ended december  and on a long term basis  although we currently anticipate that selling  general and administrative expenses will increase in future periods  we expect that net revenue increases will outpace selling  general and administrative expense increases such that selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenue will decrease in future periods 
corporate expenses 
corporate expenses decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   a decrease of million

approximately million and million of the reimbursement was attributable to out of pocket expenses incurred with third party service providers in and  respectively 
this decrease was partially offset by increased insurance costs  as well as bonuses associated with the increase in ebitda as adjusted 
as a percentage of net revenue  corporate expenses decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  excluding the univision reimbursement offset by current period univision related expenses  corporate expenses as a percentage of net revenue remained unchanged at for each of the years ended december  and we currently anticipate that corporate expenses will increase in future periods  primarily due to increased insurance costs and higher accounting  legal and other costs associated with our compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of nevertheless  we expect that these increases will be outpaced by net revenue increases such that corporate expenses as a percentage of net revenue will decrease in future periods

broadcast cash flow means operating income loss before corporate expenses  loss gain on sale of assets  depreciation and amortization and non cash stock based compensation 
ebitda as adjusted means broadcast cash flow less corporate expenses 
we use the term ebitda as adjusted because that measure does not include non cash stock based compensation 
we evaluate and project the liquidity and cash flows of our business using several measures  including broadcast cash flow and ebitda as adjusted 
we consider these measures as important indicators of liquidity relating to our operations  as they eliminate the effects of non cash loss on sale of assets  non cash depreciation and amortization and non cash stock based compensation awards 
we use these measures to evaluate liquidity and cash flow improvement from year to year as they eliminate non cash expense items 
we believe that our investors should use these measures because they may provide a better comparability of our liquidity to that of our competitors 
our calculation of ebitda as adjusted included herein is substantially similar to the measures used in the financial covenants included in our bank credit facility and in the indenture governing our senior subordinated notes 
in those instruments  ebitda as adjusted is referred to as operating cash flow and consolidated cash flow  respectively 
under our bank credit facility as currently amended  we cannot incur additional indebtedness if the incurrence of such indebtedness would result in our ratio of net debt to operating cash flow having exceeded to on a pro forma basis for the prior full four quarters 
under the indenture  the corresponding ratio of net indebtedness to consolidated cash flow cannot exceed to on the same basis 
the actual ratios of net indebtedness to each of operating cash flow and consolidated cash flow were as follows in each case for the year ended december  to   to  and  to we entered into the bank credit facility in september and issued our senior subordinated notes in march  so we were not subject to the same calculations and covenants in prior years 
for consistency of presentation  however  the foregoing historical ratios assume that our current definitions had been applied for all periods 
while we and many in the financial community consider broadcast cash flow and ebitda as adjusted to be important  they should be considered in addition to  but not as a substitute for or superior to  other measures of liquidity and financial performance prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  such as cash flows from operating activities  operating income and net income 
in addition  our definitions of broadcast cash flow and ebitda as adjusted differ from those of many companies reporting similarly named measures

as part of the transition from analog to digital television  full service television station owners may be required to stop broadcasting analog signals and relinquish their analog channels to the fcc by if the market penetration of digital television receivers reaches certain levels by that time 
we currently expect that the cost to complete construction of digital television facilities for our full service television stations between and will be approximately million 
in addition  we will be required to broadcast both digital and analog signals through this transition period  but we do not expect those incremental costs to be significant 
we intend to finance the conversion to digital television out of cash flow from operations 
the amount of our anticipated capital expenditures may change based on future changes in business plans  our financial condition and general economic conditions 
we continually review  and are currently reviewing  opportunities to acquire additional television and radio stations  as well as other broadcast or media opportunities targeting the hispanic market in the united states 
we expect to finance any future acquisitions through funds generated from operations  borrowings under our bank credit facility and additional debt and equity financing 
any additional financing  if needed  might not be available to us on reasonable terms or at all 
any failure to raise capital when needed could seriously harm our business and our acquisition strategy

application of critical accounting policies and accounting estimates critical accounting policies are defined as those that are the most important to the accurate portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
critical accounting policies require management s subjective judgment and may produce materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we have discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed and approved our related disclosure in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following are our critical accounting policies goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets effective january  we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and determined each of our operating segments to be a reporting unit 
upon adoption  we assigned all of our assets and liabilities to our reporting units and ceased amortizing goodwill and our indefinite life intangible assets 
we believe that our broadcast licenses and long term time brokerage agreements are indefinite life intangible assets 
we believe that the accounting estimates related to the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite life intangible assets and our estimates of the useful lives of our long lived assets are critical accounting estimates because goodwill and other intangible assets are our most significant assets  amortization expense is a significant component of our operating expenses  and the impact that recognizing an impairment would have on the assets reported on our balance sheet  as well as on our results of operations  could be material 
accordingly  the assumptions about future cash flows on the assets under evaluation are critical 
beginning january   goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are tested annually for impairment or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired 
in assessing the recoverability of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets  we must make assumptions about the estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of these assets 
assumptions about future revenue and cash flows require significant judgment because of the current state of the economy and the fluctuation of actual revenue and the timing of expenses 
we develop future revenue estimates based on projected ratings increases  planned timing of signal strength upgrades  planned timing of promotional events  customer commitments and available advertising time 
estimates of future cash flows assume that expenses will grow at rates consistent with historical rates 
alternatively  some stations under evaluation have had limited relevant cash flow history due to planned conversion of format or upgrade of station signal 
the assumptions about cash flows after conversion reflect estimates of how these stations are expected to perform based on similar stations and markets and possible proceeds from the sale of the assets 
if the expected cash flows are not realized  impairment losses may be recorded in the future 
for goodwill  the impairment evaluation includes a comparison of the carrying value of the reporting unit including goodwill to that reporting unit s fair value 
if the reporting unit s estimated fair value exceeds the reporting unit s carrying value  no impairment of goodwill exists 
if the fair value of the reporting unit does not exceed the unit s carrying value  then an additional analysis is performed to allocate the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as if that unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the unit was the purchase price 
if the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities is less than the carrying value of the unit s goodwill  an impairment charge is recorded for the difference 

table of contents the impairment evaluation for indefinite life intangible assets is performed by a comparison of the asset s carrying value to the asset s fair value 
when the carrying value exceeds fair value an impairment charge is recorded for the amount of the difference 
an intangible asset is determined to have an indefinite useful life when there are no legal  regulatory  contractual  competitive  economic  or any other factors that may limit the period over which the asset is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the future cash flows of the company 
in addition  each reporting period  we evaluate the remaining useful life of an intangible asset that is not being amortized to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life 
if an intangible asset that is not being amortized is determined to have a finite useful life  the asset will be amortized prospectively over the estimated remaining useful life and accounted for in the same manner as intangible assets subject to amortization 
long lived assets  including intangibles subject to amortization depreciation and amortization of our long lived assets is provided using accelerated and straight line methods over their estimated useful lives 
changes in circumstances such as the passage of new laws or changes in regulations  technological advances  changes to the company s business model or changes in the capital strategy could result in the actual useful lives differing from initial estimates 
in those cases where the company determines that the useful life of a long lived asset should be revised  the company will depreciate the net book value in excess of the estimated residual value over its revised remaining useful life 
factors such as changes in the planned use of equipment  customer attrition  contractual amendments or mandated regulatory requirements could result in shortened useful lives 
long lived assets and asset groups are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
the estimated future cash flows are based upon  among other things  assumptions about expected future operating performance and may differ from actual cash flows 
long lived assets evaluated for impairment are grouped with other assets to the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities 
if the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows excluding interest is less than the carrying value of the assets  the assets will be written down to the estimated fair value in the period in which the determination is made 
deferred taxes deferred taxes are provided on a liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and deferred liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences 
temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when it is determined to be more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in evaluating the need for a valuation allowance  we consider future taxable income  resolution of tax uncertainties and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
if we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the carrying value of the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period in which such determination was made 
revenue recognition television and radio revenue related to the sale of advertising is recognized at the time of broadcast 
network compensation from univision s primary network is recognized ratably over the period of the agreement 
revenue for outdoor advertising space is recognized ratably over the term of the contract  which is typically less than months 
stock based compensation as allowed by sfas no 
 we have elected to continue to account for our employee stock based compensation plan using the intrinsic value method in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations  which does not require compensation to be recorded if the consideration to be received is at least equal to the fair value of the common stock to be received at the measurement date 
allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectibility of our trade accounts receivable based on a number of factors 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us  a specific reserve for bad debts is estimated and recorded which reduces the recognized receivable to the estimated amount we believe will ultimately be collected 
in addition to specific customer identification of potential bad debts  bad debt charges are recorded based on our recent past loss history and an overall assessment of past due trade accounts receivable amounts outstanding 
additional information for additional information on our significant accounting policies  please see note to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents pending accounting pronouncements in  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin and its amendment  fin r 
as amended  this interpretation clarifies existing accounting principles related to the preparation of consolidated financial statements when the equity investors in an entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or when the equity at risk is not sufficient for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support 
fin r requires a company to evaluate all existing arrangements to identify situations where a company has a variable interest in a variable interest entity and further determine when such variable interests require a company to consolidate the variable interest entities financial statement with its own 
we must adopt this interpretation by march  and consolidate any variable interest entities for which we will absorb a majority of the entities expected losses or receive a majority of the expected residual gains 
we do not believe that we have any variable interests that will require consolidation or disclosure 
sensitivity of critical accounting estimates we have critical accounting estimates that are sensitive to change 
the most significant of those sensitive estimates relate to the impairment of intangible assets 
in our impairment analysis  the television and radio reporting unit fair values exceed their respective carrying values 
the fair value of the outdoor reporting unit  however  did not exceed the carrying value so we analyzed the goodwill and long lived assets of that unit for potential impairment 
we determined that there is no impairment of goodwill in the outdoor reporting unit based on the estimated fair value compared to the carrying value 
in the calculation of the fair value of goodwill  we use a combination of valuation techniques that rely on various assumptions such as estimated discounted future cash flows  multiples of revenue and earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
if those estimates of future cash flows  discount rates or multiples were to change  it could affect our impairment analysis and cause us to record an expense for impairment 
as of october  our estimated allocation of the value of goodwill exceeds the carrying value by approximately million 
we also determined in accordance with sfas no 
that there is no impairment of the long lived assets  as the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows of the outdoor reporting unit  including the estimated value of our billboards  exceeded the carrying value of the reporting unit s assets 
our estimates of future cash flows assume that we will significantly increase our outdoor revenues as compared with our outdoor expenses  and that our billboards will also increase in value 
if these estimates of future cash flows and billboard values were to change  it could affect our impairment analysis and cause us to record an expense for impairment 
as of october   the total of our estimated future undiscounted cash flows  including the estimated value of our billboards  exceeds our carrying amount of assets in the outdoor reporting unit by approximately million 
impact of inflation we believe that inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations for each of our fiscal years in the three year period ended december  however  there can be no assurance that future inflation would not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition 
off balance sheet arrangements we have entered into a no fee interest rate swap agreement covering of the outstanding balance under our bank credit facility  described more fully in item a below 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general market risk represents the potential loss that may impact our financial position  results of operations or cash flows due to adverse changes in the financial markets 
we are exposed to market risk from changes in the base rates on our variable rate debt 
under our bank credit facility  if we exceed certain leverage ratios we would be required to enter into derivative financial instrument transactions  such as swaps or interest rate caps  in order to manage or reduce our exposure to risk from changes in interest rates 
under no circumstances do we enter into derivatives or other financial instrument transactions for speculative purposes 
interest rates our revolving facility loan bears interest at a variable rate at libor as of december  plus a margin ranging from to based on our leverage 
as of december   we had million of variable rate bank debt outstanding 
our bank credit facility requires us to enter into interest rate agreements if our leverage exceeds certain limits as defined in the agreement 
an interest rate swap with limits on the floor and ceiling rates and a notional amount of million was entered into during this agreement expires in march due to the short term nature of the agreement and the projection that the interest rate floor or ceiling will not be reached during the term  the estimated fair value of this agreement is zero as of december
