introduction we are a leading specialty retailer of home decor in the united states  operating stores in states as of january  our stores present a broad selection of distinctive merchandise  including framed art  mirrors  candles  lamps  picture frames  accent rugs  garden accessories and artificial floral products 
our stores also offer an extensive assortment of holiday merchandise  as well as items carried throughout the year suitable for giving as gifts 
for the fiscal year ended january   we recorded net sales of million 
our stores offer a unique combination of style and value that has led to our emergence as a leader in home decor and has enabled us to develop a strong customer franchise 
as a result  we have achieved substantial growth over the last six fiscal years 
during this period  we have more than doubled our store base  principally through new store openings 
we intend to continue opening new stores both in existing 
table of contents and new markets 
we anticipate our growth will include mall and non mall locations in major metropolitan markets  middle markets and selected smaller communities 
we believe there are currently more than additional locations in the united states that could support a kirkland s store 
we plan on opening new stores and estimate closing stores in fiscal our fiscal year is comprised of the or week period ending on the saturday closest to january accordingly  fiscal represented weeks ended on january  fiscal represented weeks ended on february  fiscal represented weeks ended on february  overview of key financial measures net sales and gross profit are the most significant drivers to our operating performance 
net sales consists of all merchandise sales to customers  net of returns and exclusive of sales taxes 
our net sales for fiscal increased by to million from million in fiscal  reflecting sales from the new stores we opened in fiscal as well as sales increases from the stores we opened in fiscal comparable store sales declined for fiscal  primarily due to a decline in comparable store sales for the fourth quarter 
we use comparable store sales to measure our ability to achieve sales increases from stores that have been open at least one full fiscal year 
increases in comparable store sales are an important factor in maintaining or increasing the profitability of existing stores 
gross profit is the difference between net sales and cost of sales 
cost of sales has three distinct components product cost including freight cost  store occupancy cost and central distribution cost 
product cost comprises the majority of cost of sales  while central distribution cost is the least significant of these three elements 
product cost is variable  while occupancy and distribution costs are largely fixed 
accordingly  gross margin gross profit expressed as a percentage of net sales can be influenced by many factors including overall sales performance 
for fiscal  gross profit increased by to million from million for fiscal gross margin for fiscal decreased to of net sales from of net sales for fiscal  primarily due to heavier than anticipated markdown activity that resulted in higher product cost as a percentage of net sales 
operating expenses  including the costs of operating our stores and corporate headquarters  are also an important component of our operating performance 
compensation and benefits comprise the majority of our operating expenses 
operating expenses contain fixed and variable costs  and managing the operating expense ratio operating expenses expressed as a percentage of net sales is an important focus of management as we seek to maintain or increase the overall profitability of the company 
operating expenses include cash costs as well as non cash costs such as depreciation and amortization 
due to the significant fixed cost component of operating expenses  as well as the tendency of many operating costs to rise over time  increases in comparable store sales are typically necessary in order to prevent meaningful increases in the operating expense ratio 
operating expenses can also include certain costs that are of a one time or non recurring nature 
while these costs must be considered to understand fully the operating performance of the company  we typically identify such costs separately on the consolidated statement of operations so that we can evaluate comparable expense data across different periods 
a complete evaluation of our financial performance incorporates not only operating results  but also an assessment of how effectively we are deploying our capital 
we believe that a high return on capital is an indicator of a financially productive business 
accordingly  we evaluate our earnings in relation to inventories and total assets in order to determine if we are achieving acceptable levels of return on our capital 
inventory yield gross profit divided by average inventories and return on assets net income divided by total assets are two of the measures we use 

table of contents we use a number of key performance measures to evaluate our financial performance  including the following fiscal year net sales growth comparable store sales growth average net sales per store in thousands average net sales per square foot in thousands gross profit compensation and benefits as a of sales other operating expenses as a of sales inventory yield return on assets roa net sales increase for fiscal represents the change between net sales for the week period ended february   and the fiscal year ended december  we changed our fiscal year from a calendar year ended december to a week retail calendar ending on the saturday closest to january sales results from the day stub period ended february   have been excluded for purposes of this comparison 
the comparable store net sales increase for fiscal reflects the increase in comparable store net sales for the week period ended february   compared to the week period ended february  calculated using net sales of all stores open at both the beginning and the end of the period indicated 
calculated using the gross square footage of all stores open at both the beginning and the end of the period 
gross square footage includes the storage  receiving and office space that generally occupies approximately of total store space 
inventory yield is defined as gross profit divided by average inventory for each of the preceding four quarters 
return on assets equals net income loss allocable to common shareholders divided by total assets 
strategic areas of emphasis the increase in our store base during fiscal reflected a renewed commitment to growth following our initial public offering in july that transaction enabled us to reduce our debt significantly  which led to a significant reduction in interest expense and the ability to allocate more of our cash toward capital expenditures and working capital for new stores 
capital expenditures for fiscal were million  of which million was related to leasehold improvements  equipment and fixtures for new stores 
the construction of new stores will continue to be an important part of our strategy in fiscal we plan on opening new stores and closing stores in fiscal our stores historically have operated primarily in enclosed malls  but in fiscal we opened of our new stores in a variety of non mall venues including lifestyle centers  power centers and outlet centers 
at january   we operated of our stores in non mall venues  and we anticipate that the majority of our new store openings in fiscal will be in non mall venues 
although our sample of non mall stores is still relatively small  typically these stores have been able to achieve equivalent sales volumes with lower total occupancy costs than our mall stores 

table of contents the following table summarizes our stores and square footage under lease in mall and non mall locations as of january  square average stores footage store size mall non mall total another important area of emphasis will be improving the effectiveness of our supply chain 
we expect to commence operations in a newly built distribution center in the second quarter of fiscal this new facility will replace the three buildings that currently support our central distribution effort 
the commencement of operations in the new distribution center will be accompanied by the implementation of a new warehouse management system as well as investments in material handling equipment designed to streamline the flow of goods within the distribution center 
we do not expect to gain meaningful operational efficiencies from the new distribution center and related investments in fiscal however  in fiscal and beyond  our goal is to achieve better labor productivity  better transportation efficiency  leaner store level inventories and reduced store level storage costs 
our objective is to finance all of our operating and investing activities with cash provided by operations and borrowings under our revolving credit line 
our cash balances increased to million at january  from million at february  we expect that capital expenditures for fiscal will range from to million  primarily to fund the construction of new stores and store remodels  the investments in automation and information systems as part of our move to a new distribution center and the completion of several ongoing information technology projects  including the rollout of a wide area network for our stores 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and the results of our operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts contained in the financial statements and related disclosures 
we based our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
our critical accounting policies are discussed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
certain judgments and estimates utilized in implementing these accounting policies are likewise discussed in each of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
the following discussion aggregates the various critical accounting policies addressed throughout the financial statements  the judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of these policies and the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under varying conditions and assumptions 
cost of sales and inventory valuation our inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market  net of allowances  with cost determined using the average cost method with average cost approximating current cost 
we estimate the amount of shrinkage that has occurred through theft or damage and adjust that to actual at the time of our physical inventory counts which occur near our fiscal year end 
we also evaluate the cost of our inventory in relation to the estimated sales price 
this evaluation is performed to ensure that we do not carry inventory at a value in excess of the amount we expect to realize upon the sale of the merchandise 
we believe we have the appropriate merchandise valuation and pricing controls in place to minimize the risk that our inventory values would be materially misstated 
depreciation and recoverability of long lived assets approximately of our assets at january   represent investments in property and equipment 
determining appropriate depreciable lives and reasonable assumptions in evaluating the carrying value of capital assets requires judgments and estimates 

table of contents we utilize the straight line method of depreciation and a variety of depreciable lives 
land is not depreciated 
buildings are depreciated over years 
furniture  fixtures and equipment are generally depreciated over years 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the useful lives of the asset or the lease term 
our lease terms typically range from to years 
to the extent we replace or dispose of fixtures or equipment prior to the end of its assigned depreciable life  we could realize a loss or gain on the disposition 
to the extent our assets are used beyond their assigned depreciable life  no depreciation expense is being realized 
we reassess the depreciable lives in an effort to reduce the risk of significant losses or gains arising from either the disposition of our assets or the utilization of assets with no depreciation charges 
recoverability of the carrying value of store assets is assessed annually and upon the occurrence of certain events or changes in circumstances such as store closings or upcoming lease renewals 
the assessment requires judgment and estimates for future store generated cash flows 
the review includes a comparison of the carrying value of the store assets to the future cash flows expected to be generated by the store 
the underlying estimates for cash flows include estimates for future net sales  gross profit and store expense increases and decreases 
to the extent our estimates for net sales  gross profit and store expenses are not realized  future assessments of recoverability could result in additional impairment charges 
goodwill we account for our goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
accordingly  goodwill is not amortized but reviewed for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently when events and circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred 
we have not recorded an impairment to our goodwill since adopting sfas no 
insurance reserves workers compensation  general liability and employee medical insurance programs are partially self insured 
it is our policy to record a self insurance liability using estimates of claims incurred but not yet reported or paid  based on historical claims experience and trends 
actual results can vary from estimates for many reasons  including  among others  inflation rates  claim settlement patterns  litigation trends and legal interpretations 
we monitor our claims experience in light of these factors and revise our estimates of insurance reserves accordingly 
the level of our insurance reserves may increase or decrease as a result of these changing circumstances or trends 
income taxes we record income tax liabilities utilizing known obligations and estimates of potential obligations 
a deferred tax asset or liability is recognized whenever there are future tax effects from existing temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the balance that is more likely than not to be realized 
we must make estimates and judgments on future taxable income  considering feasible tax planning strategies and taking into account existing facts and circumstances  to determine the proper valuation allowance 
when we determine that deferred tax assets could be realized in greater or lesser amounts than recorded  the asset balance and income statement reflects the change in the period such determination is made 
due to changes in facts and circumstances and the estimates and judgments that are involved in determining the proper valuation allowance  differences between actual future events and prior estimates and judgments could result in adjustments to this valuation allowance 
we use an estimate of our annual effective tax rate at each interim period based on the facts and circumstances available at that time while the actual effective tax rate is calculated at year end 
stock options and warrants certain of our stock options require us to record a non cash stock compensation charge in our financial statements 
the amount of the charge is determined based upon the excess of the fair value of our common stock at the date of grant over the exercise price of the stock options 
other options have been granted to employees or directors with an exercise price that is equal to or greater than the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant 
stock options which have been granted to persons other than employees or directors in exchange for services are valued using an option pricing model 
the fair value of our common stock is a significant element of determining the value of the stock option or the amount of the non cash stock compensation charge to be recorded for our stock option awards or for non employee stock option grants 
prior to our initial public offering in july  our 
table of contents common stock was not traded on a stock exchange 
to determine the value of our common stock prior to the initial public offering we first considered the amount paid to us for our common stock in recent transactions 
absent a recent sale of our common stock  we obtained a valuation from an independent appraiser 
in each case  the determination of the fair value of our common stock requires judgment and the valuation has a direct impact on our financial statements 
we believe that reasonable methods and assumptions have been used for determining the fair value of our common stock 
fiscal compared to fiscal results of operations 
the table below sets forth selected results of our operations in dollars and expressed as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated dollars in thousands fiscal fiscal change net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses compensation and benefits other operating expenses lease termination charge   n a depreciation and amortization non cash stock compensation charge operating income interest expense  net other income  net income before income taxes income tax provision income before accretion of preferred stock and dividends accrued accretion of redeemable preferred stock and dividends accrued net income allocable to common stock net sales 
net sales increased by to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the net sales increase in fiscal resulted primarily from the opening of new stores 
we opened new stores in fiscal and new stores in fiscal  and we closed stores in fiscal and one store in fiscal our net sales also benefited from sales increases from expanded  remodeled or relocated stores  which are excluded from our comparable store base 
the impact of these changes in the store base was offset somewhat by a decline of in comparable store net sales for fiscal during fiscal  comparable store net sales increased 
the comparable store net sales decline was primarily the result of a weak fourth quarter  during which comparable store net sales declined 
key categories that outperformed the prior year included wall decor  candles  textiles and housewares 
these increases were offset by declines in lamps  garden  decorative accessories and holiday 
in response to weak sales in the holiday category in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we purchased less holiday merchandise for the fourth quarter of fiscal however  sales in our non holiday categories were not sufficient to make up for the lower sales of holiday merchandise 
the comparable store sales performance was characterized by relatively flat unit sales along with a slight decrease in the average retail price per item 

table of contents gross profit 
gross profit increased million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal gross profit expressed as a percentage of net sales decreased to for fiscal  from for fiscal the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales resulted from higher product cost of sales  which includes freight expenses 
product cost of sales  including freight expenses  increased during fiscal as a percentage of sales  primarily due to heavier markdown activity in response to a sluggish sales environment and the underperformance of certain merchandise categories  particularly in the first and second quarters 
store occupancy costs also increased as a percentage of sales due to the comparable store net sales decline 
consistent with our strategic plans  central distribution costs increased slightly as a percentage of net sales as we continued to build the infrastructure to support a higher level of activity in our central distribution centers 
we expect to continue to experience cost increases in central distribution as we move into a new distribution center and begin to handle a greater percentage of merchandise purchases in this new facility 
compensation and benefits 
compensation and benefits  including both store and corporate personnel  was million  or of net sales  for fiscal as compared to million  or for fiscal the decline in these expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily the result of lower levels of incentive compensation this year as compared to the prior year due to underperformance versus our plan during fiscal tight payroll management at the store level in response to a difficult sales environment also helped us to produce a reduction in payroll as a percentage of net sales despite the negative comparable store net sales performance 
other operating expenses 
other operating expenses  including both store and corporate costs  were million  or of net sales  for fiscal as compared to million  or of net sales  for fiscal the increase in these operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily the result of the negative comparable store sales performance and the lack of a positive leveraging effect on the relatively fixed components of store and corporate operating expenses 
in addition  the increase in these expenses as a percentage of net sales was partially due to expenses incurred in connection with our accelerated store expansion plan 
furthermore  corporate insurance costs increased as we experienced a full year of impact from the enhancements in directors and officers coverage that were made upon completion of the initial public offering in july lease termination charge 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we provided notice to our landlords of our intent to terminate the leases on our existing central distribution facilities 
consequently  upon providing that notice  we recorded a one time charge of million related to the penalties associated with these early terminations 
no such charge was recorded during fiscal depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense was million  or of net sales  for fiscal as compared to million  or of net sales  for fiscal the increase in depreciation and amortization was the result of the growth of the store base and the completion of various information technology projects 
non cash stock compensation charge 
during fiscal  we incurred non cash stock compensation charges related to stock options granted to certain employees in november during fiscal  we incurred non cash stock compensation charges related to these options as well as certain stock options granted to a consultant in july  and certain re priced employee stock options for which variable accounting methods were required 
charges related to these stock option arrangements amounting to million  or of net sales  were recorded for fiscal  a decrease from million  or of net sales  for fiscal see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
we will continue to incur an approximate  charge related to the november grant of employee stock options each quarter through the third quarter of fiscal interest expense  net 
net interest expense was million  or of net sales  for fiscal as compared to million  or of net sales  for fiscal the decrease was the result of a combination of factors including our may debt refinancing  our july initial public offering  strong cash flow from operations and low interest rates 
during fiscal  we recorded interest expense associated with our mandatorily redeemable class c preferred stock of million  or of net sales 

table of contents no interest was recorded related to the class c preferred stock during due to its repayment in connection with the initial public offering 
amortization of debt issue costs was million  or of net sales  for fiscal as compared to million  or of net sales  for fiscal the decrease was the result of our may refinancing and the related reduction of issue costs in comparison to our previous financing arrangements 
additionally  during fiscal  we recorded a loss on the early extinguishment of long term debt in the amount of million  or of net sales  upon repayment in full of our term loan 
no such charge was recorded during fiscal income taxes 
income tax provision was million  or of income before income taxes  for fiscal compared to million  or of income before income taxes  for fiscal the decrease in the effective tax rate for fiscal was primarily the result of fewer non deductible stock compensation charges during as compared to fiscal net income 
as a result of the foregoing  income before accretion of preferred stock and dividends accrued was million  or of net sales  for fiscal compared to million  or of net sales  for fiscal during fiscal  preferred stock accretion and dividends of million were recorded  resulting in net income allocable to common shareholders of million 
fiscal compared to fiscal results of operations 
the table below sets forth selected results of our operations in dollars and expressed as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated dollars in thousands fiscal fiscal change net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses compensation and benefits other operating expenses depreciation and amortization non cash stock compensation charge operating income interest expense  net other income  net income before income taxes income tax provision income before accretion of preferred stock and dividends accrued accretion of redeemable preferred stock and dividends accrued net income allocable to common stock net sales 
net sales increased by to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the net sales increase in fiscal resulted primarily from an increase in comparable store net sales 
we also opened new stores in fiscal and five new stores in fiscal  and we closed one store in fiscal and nine stores in fiscal our net sales also benefited from sales increases from expanded  remodeled or relocated stores  which are excluded from our comparable store base 
the increase in comparable store net sales accounted for approximately million of the total net sales increase  or  and the net increase in the store base over the last two fiscal years along with 
table of contents sales increases from expanded  remodeled or relocated stores accounted for approximately million  or  of the total net sales increase 
the comparable store net sales increase was primarily the result of an improved inventory position and fresher merchandise mix as compared to the prior year  as we continued to benefit from the investments in distribution and information systems that we made in fiscal and key categories contributing to the improvement in comparable store net sales included wall decor  lamps and decorative accessories 
the comparable store net sales increase resulted entirely from an increase in unit sales 
through the first three quarters of fiscal  we experienced increases in both unit sales and the average retail price per item 
however  significant markdown activity negatively impacted retail prices during the fourth quarter  resulting in an average retail price per item that was relatively unchanged for fiscal compared to fiscal gross profit 
gross profit increased million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal gross profit expressed as a percentage of net sales increased to for fiscal  from for fiscal the increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales resulted primarily from the leveraging of store occupancy costs through higher net sales 
product cost of sales  including freight expenses  was relatively flat for fiscal as a percentage of sales  primarily due to the significant markdown activity that took place in the fourth quarter in response to a heavily promotional retail environment and comparatively weak sales trends in the holiday merchandise category compared to the prior year 
consistent with our strategic plans  central distribution costs increased slightly as a percentage of net sales as we leased additional space and hired additional staff to support a higher level of activity in our central distribution centers 
compensation and benefits 
compensation and benefits  including both store and corporate personnel  was million  or of net sales  for fiscal as compared to million  or of net sales  for fiscal the decline in these expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily the result of the strong net sales that leveraged store and corporate payroll costs 
the positive impact from the strong sales was offset somewhat by increases in corporate payroll due to increased incentive compensation and increases in headcount in anticipation of our growth plans 
other operating expenses 
other operating expenses  including both store and corporate costs  were million  or of net sales  for fiscal as compared to million  or of net sales  for fiscal the decline in these expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily the result of the strong net sales that leveraged the relatively fixed components of store operating expenses and corporate overhead expenses 
furthermore  by continuing to improve our inventory management and distribution practices  we were able to save over  in costs related to local storage facilities and related truck rentals 
offsetting these expense reductions and the leveraging impact were increases in insurance costs due to rising premiums and coverage enhancements and an increase in professional fees incurred on supply chain improvement projects 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense was million  or of net sales  for fiscal as compared to million  or of net sales  for fiscal the decline as a percentage of net sales was the result of the strong net sales performance as well as a decline in capital expenditures in recent fiscal years 
non cash stock compensation charge 
during fiscal  we incurred non cash stock compensation charges related to certain stock options granted to a consultant in july  stock options granted to certain employees in november  and certain re priced employee stock options for which variable accounting methods were required 
charges related to these stock option arrangements amounting to million  or of net sales  were recorded for fiscal  an increase from million  or of net sales  for fiscal see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
we will continue to incur a  charge related to the november grant of certain employee stock options each quarter through the third quarter of fiscal interest expense  net 
net interest expense was million  or of net sales  for fiscal as compared to million  or of net sales  for fiscal the decrease was the result of a combination of factors including our may debt refinancing  our july initial public offering  
table of contents strong cash flow from operations and low interest rates 
during fiscal  we recorded interest expense associated with the mandatorily redeemable class c preferred stock of million  or of net sales 
this represented a decline from million  or of net sales  for fiscal due to the repayment of the class c preferred stock in connection with our initial public offering 
amortization of debt issue costs was million  or of net sales  for fiscal as compared to million  or of net sales  for fiscal this decline was the result of our may refinancing and the related reduction in issue costs as compared to our previous financing arrangements 
we recorded no accretion of common stock warrants in fiscal  compared to million  or of net sales  in fiscal the accretion of common stock warrants reflects the accretion to fair value of detachable put warrants issued by us in connection with our issuance of subordinated debt in all of these warrants were exercised in connection with our july initial public offering 
income taxes 
income tax provision was million  or of income before income taxes  for fiscal compared to million  or of income before income taxes  for fiscal the decrease in the effective tax rate for fiscal was primarily the result of the higher level of income before income taxes in fiscal as compared to fiscal  which reduced the tax rate impact of non deductible stock compensation charges 
net income 
as a result of the foregoing  income before accretion of preferred stock and dividends accrued was million  or of net sales  for fiscal compared to million  or of net sales  for fiscal preferred stock accretion and dividends totaled million for fiscal and million for fiscal  resulting in net income allocable to common shareholders of million in fiscal and a loss of million in fiscal liquidity and capital resources our principal capital requirements are for working capital and capital expenditures 
working capital consists mainly of merchandise inventories  which typically reach their peak by the end of the third quarter of each fiscal year 
capital expenditures primarily relate to new store openings  existing store expansions  remodels or relocations  and purchases of equipment or information technology assets for our stores  distribution facilities or corporate headquarters 
historically  we have funded our working capital and capital expenditure requirements with internally generated cash  borrowings under our credit facilities and proceeds from the sale of equity securities 
cash flows from operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the fluctuations in net cash provided by operating activities over the last three fiscal years were primarily a function of changes in working capital and the timing of interest payments on indebtedness 
working capital  excluding cash and current portions of debt  decreased million during fiscal as a result of a comprehensive effort to reduce store level inventories and improve inventory turnover 
furthermore  during fiscal  we deliberately reduced our number of new store openings  reducing our need for incremental working capital 
during fiscal  the same component of working capital increased million as we began to increase our growth rate 
additionally  during  we refinanced our existing indebtedness and completed an initial public offering 
through these two financing events  we repaid million in previously accrued interest 
the combination of these factors led to a reduction in net cash provided by operating activities as compared to fiscal during fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities increased as a result of the lack of large payments of accrued interest due to the retirement of all outstanding long term debt during fiscal non cash working capital increased million during fiscal as we continued to increase our growth rate and require incremental inventory investment for our new stores 
offsetting this incremental use of cash  we received a benefit from the new bonus depreciation tax laws that were in effect for fiscal  resulting in a favorable impact on operating cash flow 
we will continue to benefit from this tax treatment in fiscal  however  the bonus depreciation laws are set to expire for fiscal 
table of contents cash flows from investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities was million  million and million for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
these amounts consisted entirely of capital expenditures offset slightly by proceeds received from the sale of certain assets 
these capital expenditures primarily included investments in new store construction  existing store remodels  and information technology assets for stores and the corporate headquarters 
the increase in this amount over the last three fiscal years is due to the growth in our store base and the related infrastructure investments we have made to prepare us for our growth and expansion plans 
during fiscal  we opened new stores and remodeled stores 
we expect that capital expenditures for fiscal will range from to million  primarily to fund the construction of new stores and store remodels  the investments in automation and information systems as part of our move to a new distribution center and the completion of several ongoing information technology projects  including the rollout of a wide area network for our stores 
we anticipate that capital expenditures  including leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures  for our fiscal new stores will average approximately   per store net of landlord allowances 
cash flows from financing activities 
net cash used in financing activities was  million  and million for fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal  respectively 
cash flows from financing activities for fiscal were primarily comprised of borrowings and repayments under our revolving credit facility 
the facility was drawn up to a peak of million and paid down to zero by the end of the fiscal year 
during fiscal  two significant financing events took place our senior debt refinancing and our initial public offering of common stock 
the net use of cash for fiscal reflected the retirement of approximately million in long term obligations and certain shares of common stock 
these retirements and repurchases were funded with a combination of existing cash balances and the proceeds of these two financing events 
additionally  using availability from our revolving line of credit we were able to complete the full repayment of our million term loan during the third quarter of fiscal the use of cash during fiscal included the repayment of our revolving line of credit  which was fully drawn to million at the beginning of the year  as well as principal payments on indebtedness that was outstanding at that time 
revolving credit facility 
with the completion of our initial public offering and the application of the net proceeds toward debt reduction along with the repayment of our term loan  our only remaining debt consists of our million revolving credit facility 
amounts borrowed under the facility bear interest at a floating rate equal to the prime rate or libor plus  at our election 
the maximum availability under the credit facility is limited by a borrowing base that consists of a percentage of eligible inventory less reserves 
our credit lender may from time to time reduce the lending formula with respect to the eligible inventory to the extent our lender determines that the liquidation value of the eligible inventory has decreased 
our lender also from time to time may decrease the borrowing base by adding reserves with respect to matters such as inventory shrinkage 
the facility also contains provisions that could result in changes in the presented terms of the facility or the acceleration of maturity 
circumstances that could lead to such changes in terms or acceleration include  but are not limited to  a material adverse change in our business or an event of default under the credit agreement 
the facility has two financial covenants  both of which are tested quarterly on a latest twelve months basis 
the first covenant establishes a minimum level of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization excluding certain non cash items  or ebitda  less capital expenditures  and the second covenant establishes a maximum senior debt to ebitda ratio 
as of january   we were in compliance with all financial covenants under the facility 
the facility terminates in may as of january   we had no borrowings outstanding under the facility 
at january   our balance of cash and cash equivalents was million and the borrowing availability under our revolving credit facility was approximately million 
we believe that these sources of cash  together with cash provided by our operations  will be adequate to carry out our fiscal growth plans in full and fund our planned capital expenditures  interest payments and working capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 

table of contents contractual obligations 
the following table identifies payment obligations for the periods indicated under our current contractual arrangements 
the amounts set forth below reflect contractual obligations as of january   and do not reflect our expectations as to expenditures for the categories of obligations described below 
the timing and or the amount of the payments may be changed in accordance with the terms of the contracts or new contractual obligations may be added 
payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years in dollars operating lease obligations purchase obligations total operating leases consist of future minimum rental payments required under non cancelable operating leases and does not include future minimum sublease rentals 
the amounts included above primarily consist of operating leases for our store locations and distribution facilities  but also include operating leases for certain equipment and vehicles 
purchase obligations consist entirely of open purchase orders of merchandise inventory as of january  seasonality and quarterly results we have historically experienced and expect to continue to experience substantial seasonal fluctuations in our net sales and operating income 
we believe this is the general pattern typical of our segment of the retail industry and  as a result  expect that this pattern will continue in the future 
our quarterly results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of other factors  including the timing of new store openings  net sales contributed by new stores  shifts in the timing of certain holidays and competition 
consequently  comparisons between quarters are not necessarily meaningful and the results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of future results 
our strongest sales period is the winter holiday season 
consequently  we generally realize a disproportionate amount of our net sales and a substantial majority of our operating and net income during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 
in anticipation of the increased sales activity during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year  we purchase large amounts of inventory and hire temporary staffing help for our stores 
our operating performance could suffer if net sales were below seasonal norms during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 
our net sales  operating income and net income are typically lowest in the first quarter of our fiscal year 
we expect this trend to continue 

table of contents the following table sets forth certain unaudited financial and operating data for kirkland s in each fiscal quarter during fiscal and fiscal the unaudited quarterly information includes all normal recurring adjustments that we consider necessary for a fair presentation of the information shown
