table of contents effective january   spinnaker adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
requires entities to record a liability for asset retirement obligations at fair value in the period in which it is incurred and a corresponding increase in the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
as of january   the company recorded asset retirement costs of million and asset retirement obligations of million 
the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle was million  after taxes of million 
accretion expense is the recognition of period to period changes in the asset retirement obligation liability resulting from the passage of time  subsequent to the initial asset retirement obligation liability measurement 
gain on settlement of asset retirement obligations represents the difference between the actual cost of the asset retirement and the asset retirement obligation 
the company had in place both financial hedge and physical contracts with enron north america corp 
at the time enron corp 
and its subsidiaries filed for bankruptcy in december spinnaker did not receive payment for fixed price swap contracts totaling million  which were intended to hedge december natural gas sales  and million related to november natural gas production sold to enron entities 
the company recorded a net reserve of million against these receivables 
prior to july  the stock option agreements of two of the company s officers provided that they could elect to have spinnaker deliver shares equal to the appreciation in the value of the stock over the option price in lieu of purchasing the amount of shares under option 
based on management s estimate of the share value of spinnaker  the company recorded compensation expense of approximately million in related to the stock appreciation rights of the stock option agreements 
in july  these two officers agreed to eliminate the stock appreciation rights feature of their stock option agreements 
the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in represents the adoption of statement of position reporting on the costs of start up activities 
on april   the company completed a public offering of  shares of common stock 
on august   the company completed a public offering of  shares of common stock 
in connection with its initial public offering in  the company issued  shares of common stock  converted all then outstanding shares of series a convertible preferred stock  par value per share preferred stock  into  shares of common stock and issued  shares of common stock to certain holders of the previously outstanding preferred stock in lieu of payment of accrued cash dividends 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview our objective since inception has been to assemble a large d seismic database and focus on exploration activities exclusively in the gulf of mexico because we believe this area represents one of the most attractive exploration regions in north america 
we also believe a geographic focus provides an excellent opportunity to develop and maintain competitive advantages through our regional exploration and operating expertise 
we try to maintain balance and diversity in our exploration approach by drilling both shallow water and deepwater prospects  ranging from lower risk prospects to higher risk  higher potential prospects 
spinnaker recognized net income of million  or per diluted share  compared to net income of million  or per diluted share 
these financial results were impacted by a higher average commodity price  lower production and a million increase in hedging losses in the lease operating expense rate per mcfe increased  primarily due to workover activities 
the dd a expense rate per mcfe increased in  primarily due to our strategy of maintaining balance and diversity in our exploration activities  particularly in the deep shelf play where higher costs and risks accompany the potential for higher rewards 
spinnaker had million in cash and cash equivalents and outstanding borrowings of million as of december  
table of contents spinnaker has experienced and expects to continue to experience substantial capital requirements 
we have incurred capital costs of almost billion in the past three years 
additionally  we have had negative working capital at the end of each of the last three years  including a deficit of million as of december  spinnaker has capital expenditure plans for totaling approximately million 
we believe that cash flows from operations  proceeds from available borrowings under the revolver and front runner spar production facility financing opportunities will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements in the next twelve months 
production of bcfe in was down from production of bcfe 
proved oil and gas reserves of bcfe as of december  were up from june  proved reserves of bcfe 
although we have been able to maintain a drilling success rate of approximately since inception  our exploratory drilling successes on the shelf and deep shelf since the second half of have been smaller and had less impact on our operating results than those prior to that time  resulting in a negative impact on our subsequent production and reserve growth 
additionally  several of our discoveries since mid were in the deep water  and we do not expect to see the full impact on production from these projects until after production since inception  of spinnaker s total production has been natural gas  including in considering oil and condensate production from deepwater projects in and  we anticipate that this concentration in natural gas production will decrease to approximately three fourths of total production in and approximately one half of total production in as a result  spinnaker s revenues  profitability and cash flows will be less sensitive to natural gas prices and more sensitive to oil and condensate prices 
generally  spinnaker s producing properties on the shelf have high initial production rates followed by steep declines 
as a result  we must continually drill for and develop new oil and gas reserves to replace those being depleted by production 
substantial capital expenditures are required to find and develop these reserves 
our challenge is to find and develop reserves at economic rates and commence production of these reserves as quickly and efficiently as possible 
oil and gas property costs spinnaker participated in successful wells in attempts in capital costs incurred for leasehold and other acquisition  exploration and development activities in  excluding asset retirement costs of million  totaled million compared to million in excluding asset retirement costs  capital costs incurred for development and leasehold and other acquisition activities totaled approximately of total capital costs incurred in the majority of the development costs were incurred at front runner and mississippi canyon zia 
during  we announced the front runner spar hull completion and delivery and progress on the related topsides 
we expect to take possession of the spar production facility in the summer of  followed by the commencement of well completion activities 
initial production on front runner is scheduled for the second half of zia  our third successful deepwater completion  commenced production in june we also announced a deepwater discovery at desoto canyon amazon spiderman in late we currently plan to drill approximately wells on the shelf and wells in the deep water in we expect more than of our capital expenditure budget to be used for exploration activities  up from in finding and development costs we believe that the dd a rate is the best measure for evaluating finding and development costs per mcfe since the rate generally considers all acquisition  exploration and development costs 
the rate also considers any additional development costs associated with proved reserves  such as costs for drilling new wells  
table of contents sidetracks and recompletions  which spinnaker will incur in the future to produce the oil and gas reserves and an estimate of the costs to abandon wells  platforms  facilities and pipelines after reservoirs are depleted 
however  other factors must also be considered when relying on the dd a rate as a measure for evaluating a company s finding and development costs per mcfe 
in most cases  the total estimated resource of a reservoir is not usually proved with only one well  and the initial proved reserves are generally burdened with of the development costs as well as any future development costs 
the dd a rate per mcfe is calculated quarterly and increased to in the fourth quarter of from in the fourth quarter of the increase in the dd a rate was primarily due to costs of million associated with nine unsuccessful wells in and higher finding costs associated with new discoveries in  as well as the timing and reserve recognition associated with economical discoveries 
oil and gas reserves spinnaker has achieved reserve growth through exploration activities 
we have not acquired reserves through acquisition activities 
as of december   ryder scott estimated net proved reserves at approximately bcfe  with a present value  discounted at per annum  of pre tax future net cash flows of approximately billion 
the discovery of the front runner field in significantly changed our reserve profile 
proved oil and condensate reserves were of total proved reserves as of december  compared to as of december  proved undeveloped reserves were approximately of total proved reserves as of december  front runner represented approximately of total proved undeveloped reserves 
natural gas and oil prices and hedging activities prices for natural gas and oil fluctuate widely  primarily affecting the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures  our ability to borrow and raise additional capital and the amount of natural gas and oil that we can economically produce 
natural gas prices have been extremely volatile recently as a result of various factors  including weather  industrial demand and uncertainty related to the ability of the energy industry to provide supply to meet future demand 
there are questions whether fundamentals support current natural gas prices 
spinnaker enters into hedging arrangements from time to time to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in natural gas and oil prices and to achieve more predictable cash flow 
however  these contracts also limit the benefits we would realize if prices increase 
we recorded a net hedging loss of million from through  including a net hedging loss of million in major challenges related to our hedging activities include a determination of the proper production volumes to hedge and acceptable commodity price levels for each hedge transaction 
revenues  profitability  cash flow and future growth depend substantially on prevailing oil and gas prices and our ability to find and develop oil and gas reserves that are economically recoverable 
a substantial or extended decline in the prices for oil and gas could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations  cash flows  quantities of oil and gas reserves that may be economically produced and access to capital 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
significant estimates include dd a of proved oil and gas properties 
oil and gas reserve estimates  
table of contents which are the basis for unit of production dd a and the full cost ceiling test  are inherently imprecise and are expected to change as future information becomes available 
in addition  alternatives may exist among various accounting methods 
in such cases  the choice of accounting method may also have a significant impact on reported amounts 
our critical accounting policies are as follows full cost method of accounting the accounting for oil and gas exploration and production is subject to special accounting rules that are specific to the industry 
two allowable methods exist for these activities the successful efforts method and the full cost method 
several significant differences exist between the two methods 
the major difference is under the successful efforts method  costs such as geological and geophysical  exploratory dry holes and delay rentals are expensed as incurred where under the full cost method  these types of charges are capitalized into the full cost pool 
we use the full cost method of accounting for investments in oil and gas properties 
under this method  all acquisition  exploration and development costs  including certain related employee costs  incurred for the purpose of exploring for and developing oil and gas properties are capitalized 
acquisition costs include costs incurred to purchase  lease or otherwise acquire property 
exploration costs include the costs of drilling exploratory wells  including those in progress  geological and geophysical service costs and depreciation of support equipment used in exploration activities 
development costs include the costs of drilling development wells  completions  platforms  facilities  pipelines and the costs related to the retirement of these assets 
costs associated with production and general corporate activities are expensed in the period incurred 
sales of oil and gas properties  whether or not being amortized currently  are accounted for as adjustments of capitalized costs  with no gain or loss recognized  unless such adjustments would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved oil and gas reserves 
application of the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties generally results in higher capitalized costs  no exploration costs and higher dd a rates than the application of the successful efforts method of accounting 
although some of these costs will ultimately result in no additional reserves  we expect the benefits of successful wells to more than offset the costs of any unsuccessful ones 
as a result  we believe that the full cost method of accounting better reflects the true economics of exploring for and developing oil and gas reserves 
our financial position and results of operations would have been significantly different had we used the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas investments 
reserve estimates ryder scott prepares estimates of our proved oil and gas reserves as of june and december each year 
these estimates of proved reserves are based on the quantities of oil and gas which geological and engineering data demonstrate  with reasonable certainty  to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data  engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
for example  we must estimate  among others  the amount and timing of future production  operating  workover and transportation expenses and development and abandonment costs  all of which may vary considerably from actual results 
in addition  as prices and cost levels change from year to year  the estimate of proved reserves also changes 
any significant variance in these assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of our oil and gas reserves 
despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates  our reserves are used throughout our financial statements 
for example  we use the units of production method to amortize our oil and gas properties and the quantity of reserves could significantly impact our dd a rate and related expense 
our oil and gas properties are also subject to a ceiling limitation based in part on the quantity of our proved reserves 
finally  these proved reserves are the basis for our supplemental oil and gas disclosures 

table of contents depreciation  depletion amortization spinnaker s full cost dd a expense is comprised of many factors  including costs incurred in the acquisition  exploration and development of proved oil and gas reserves  production levels  estimates of proved reserve quantities and future development and abandonment costs 
spinnaker computes the provision for dd a of oil and gas properties using the unit of production method based upon production and estimates of proved reserve quantities 
unevaluated costs and related carrying costs are excluded from the amortization base until the properties associated with these costs are evaluated 
in addition to costs associated with evaluated properties  the amortization base includes estimated future development costs and estimated salvage values associated with future asset retirement obligations 
certain future development costs may be excluded from amortization when incurred in connection with major development projects expected to entail significant costs to ascertain the quantities of proved reserves attributable to the properties under development 
the amounts that may be excluded are portions of the costs that relate to the major development project and have not previously been included in the amortization base and the estimated future expenditures associated with the development project 
such costs may be excluded from costs to be amortized until the earlier determination of whether additional reserves are proved or impairment occurs 
as of december   we excluded from the amortization base estimated future expenditures of million associated with common development costs for the deepwater discovery at front runner 
this estimate of future expenditures associated with common development costs is based on existing proved reserves to total proved reserves expected to be established upon completion of the front runner project 
if the million had been included in the amortization base as of december   and no additional reserves were assigned to the front runner project  the dd a rate as of december  would have been per mcfe  or an increase of over the actual dd a rate of per mcfe 
all future development costs associated with the deepwater discovery at front runner are included in the determination of estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves used in the full cost ceiling calculation  as discussed below 
full cost ceiling capitalized costs of oil and gas properties  net of accumulated dd a  asset retirement obligations and related deferred taxes  are limited to the estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves  including the effects of hedging activities in place as of december   discounted at  plus the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties  as adjusted for related income tax effects full cost ceiling 
if capitalized costs of the full cost pool exceed the ceiling limitation  the excess is charged to expense 
as of december   spinnaker s full cost ceiling  including estimated future net cash flows calculated using commodity prices of per mcf of natural gas and per barrel of oil and condensate  exceeded capitalized costs of oil and gas properties  net of accumulated dd a  asset retirement obligations and related deferred taxes  by approximately million 
considering the volatility of natural gas and oil prices  it is probable that our estimate of discounted future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves will change in the near term 
if natural gas or oil prices decline  even if for only a short period of time  if we incur significant costs associated with unsuccessful drilling operations or if we have downward revisions to our estimated proved reserves  it is possible that write downs of oil and gas properties could occur in the future 
unproved properties the costs associated with unproved properties and properties under development are not initially included in the amortization base and primarily relate to unevaluated leasehold acreage and delay rentals  seismic data  wells in progress and wells pending determination 
unevaluated leasehold costs and delay rentals are either transferred to the amortization base with the costs of drilling the related well or are assessed quarterly for possible 
table of contents impairment or reduction in value 
unevaluated leasehold costs and delay rentals are transferred to the amortization base if a reduction in value has occurred 
the costs of seismic data are transferred to the amortization base using the sum of the year s digits method over a period of six years 
the costs associated with wells in progress and wells pending determination are transferred to the amortization base once a determination is made whether or not proved reserves can be assigned to the property 
the costs of drilling exploratory dry holes and associated leasehold costs are included in the amortization base immediately upon determination that the well is unsuccessful 
leasehold costs in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations  which requires the use of the purchase method of accounting for business combinations initiated after june  and eliminates the pooling of interests method 
in july  the fasb also issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which discontinues the practice of amortizing goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets and initiates an annual review of impairment 
the new standard also requires that  at a minimum  all intangible assets be aggregated and presented as a separate line item in the balance sheet 
the adoption of sfas no 
and had no impact on spinnaker s financial position or results of operations 
a reporting issue has arisen regarding the application of certain provisions of sfas no 
and to companies in the extractive industries  including oil and gas companies 
the issue is whether sfas no 
requires registrants to classify the costs of mineral rights associated with extracting oil and gas as intangible assets in the balance sheet  apart from other capitalized oil and gas property costs  and provide specific footnote disclosures 
historically  we have included the costs of mineral rights associated with extracting oil and gas as a component of oil and gas properties 
if it is ultimately determined that sfas no 
requires oil and gas companies to classify costs of mineral rights associated with extracting oil and gas as a separate intangible assets line item on the balance sheet  we would be required to reclassify approximately million and million as of december  and  respectively  from oil and gas properties to a separate intangible assets line item 
these costs include those to acquire contract based drilling and mineral use rights such as delay rentals  lease bonuses  commission and brokerage fees and other leasehold costs 
our cash flows and results of operations would not be affected since such intangible assets would continue to be depleted and assessed for impairment in accordance with full cost accounting rules  as allowed by sfas no 
further  we do not believe the classification of the costs of mineral rights associated with extracting oil and gas as intangible assets would have any impact on compliance with covenants under the revolver 
spinnaker will continue to classify its oil and gas leasehold costs as tangible oil and gas properties until further guidance is provided 
we anticipate there will be no effect on our results of operations or cash flows 
asset retirement obligations we recognize the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred 
the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the asset 
the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation is the amount which that liability could be settled in a current transaction between willing parties 
spinnaker uses the expected cash flow approach for calculating asset retirement obligations 
the liability is discounted using the credit adjusted risk free interest rate in effect when the liability is initially recognized 
the changes in the liability for an asset retirement obligation due to the passage of time are measured by applying an interest method of allocation to the amount of the liability at the beginning of the period 
this amount is recognized as an increase in the carrying amount of the liability and as accretion expense classified as an operating item in the statement of operations 
financial instruments and price risk management activities at december   our financial instruments consisted of cash and cash equivalents  receivables  payables and derivative instruments 
the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents  receivables 
table of contents and payables approximate fair value because of the short term nature of these items 
spinnaker enters into hedging arrangements from time to time to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in natural gas and oil prices and to achieve more predictable cash flow 
these hedging arrangements take the form of swap contracts or cashless collars and are placed with major trading counterparties 
we recorded a net hedging loss of million  a net hedging gain of million and a net hedging loss of million in  and  respectively 
stock based compensation sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  amends sfas no 
to provide alternative methods of transition for an entity that voluntarily changes to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and to require prominent disclosure about the effects on reported net income of an entity s accounting policy decisions with respect to stock based employee compensation 
sfas no 
amends accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 interim financial reporting  to require disclosure about those effects in interim financial information 
sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  encourages  but does not require  companies to record compensation cost for stock based employee compensation plans at fair value 
we have chosen to account for stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed in apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
accordingly  compensation cost for stock options is measured as the excess  if any  of the fair value of the common stock at the date of the grant over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the common stock 
in accordance with apb opinion no 
 compensation expense related to stock based compensation was  million and million in  and  respectively

mr 
roger l 
jarvis  chairman of the board  chief executive officer and president of spinnaker  has served as a director of national oilwell since february these amounts represent less than of baker hughes  cooper cameron s and national oilwell s total revenues 
we believe that these transactions are at arm s length and the charges we pay for such goods  equipment and services are competitive with the charges and fees of other companies providing oilfield goods  equipment and services to the oil and gas exploration and production industry 
each of these companies is a leader in their respective segments of the oilfield services sector 
spinnaker could be at a disadvantage if it were to discontinue using these companies as vendors 
risk factors in addition to the other information set forth elsewhere in this annual report  the following factors should be carefully considered when evaluating spinnaker 
exploration is a high risk activity  and the d seismic data and other advanced technologies spinnaker uses cannot eliminate exploration risk and require experienced technical personnel whom we may be unable to attract or retain 
our future success will depend on the success of our exploratory drilling program 
exploration activities involve numerous risks  including the risk that no commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs will be 
table of contents discovered 
in addition  we are often uncertain as to the future cost or timing of drilling  completing and producing wells 
furthermore  drilling operations may be curtailed  delayed or canceled as a result of the additional exploration time and expense associated with a variety of factors  including unexpected drilling conditions  pressure or irregularities in formations  equipment failures or accidents  adverse weather conditions  compliance with governmental requirements and shortages or delays in the availability of drilling rigs or equipment 
even when used and properly interpreted  d seismic data and visualization techniques only assist geoscientists in identifying subsurface structures and hydrocarbon indicators 
they do not allow the interpreter to know conclusively if hydrocarbons are present or economically producible 
we could incur losses as a result of expenditures on unsuccessful wells 
poor results from our exploration activities could materially and adversely affect future cash flows and results of operations 
our exploratory drilling success will depend  in part  on our ability to attract and retain experienced explorationists and other professional personnel 
competition for explorationists and engineers with experience in the gulf of mexico is extremely intense 
if we cannot retain current personnel or attract additional experienced personnel  our ability to compete in the gulf of mexico could be adversely affected 
a substantial portion of our proved reserves are associated with the deepwater oil discovery at front runner 
the development of front runner has required and will continue to require financial resources before initial production and remains subject to other uncertainties that could have a material impact on the development of this discovery 
spinnaker s deepwater oil discovery at front runner  in which we have a non operator working interest  has required and will continue to require significant financial resources in advance of the expected initial production date in the second half of spinnaker has incurred million in capital expenditures for front runner through december  and expects to incur an aggregate of approximately million in future development costs during and million after because another oil and gas exploration and production company operates front runner  we have a limited ability to influence the operations and costs associated with this property 
front runner is located in approximately  feet of water 
the eight wells have been drilled in the front runner area to total depths in excess of  feet 
we have limited experience with large deepwater and deep drilling depth discoveries similar to front runner as most of our prior discoveries have occurred in shallower waters and drilling depths 
as a result of these uncertainties and risks  we may encounter difficulties and delays that could cause actual expenditures to exceed anticipated amounts 
construction of the topsides of the spar production facility is expected to be completed in the second quarter of construction of the hull is complete 
weather and other conditions may delay the installation of the spar production facility on location 
any delays in the delivery or installation dates would cause a delay in the initial production date 
front runner accounted for approximately of spinnaker s proved undeveloped reserves as of december  if the actual reserves associated with front runner are substantially less than the estimated reserves  our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
when production ultimately commences for this discovery  it may produce substantially less oil and gas than currently projected 
additionally  we cannot predict commodity prices when production commences 
if production is substantially less than currently projected or commodity prices are low  our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
these uncertainties and other risks described in this risk factors section and elsewhere in this annual report make it difficult to predict whether front runner can be successfully or economically developed 
if front runner cannot be successfully and economically developed  our future business  financial condition and operating results will be materially and adversely affected 

table of contents the oil and gas business involves many operating risks that can cause substantial losses 
the oil and gas business involves a variety of operating risks  including fires  explosions  blow outs and surface cratering  uncontrollable flows of underground oil  natural gas and formation water  natural disasters  pipe or cement failures  casing collapses  embedded oilfield drilling and service tools  abnormally pressured formations and environmental hazards such as natural gas leaks  oil spills  pipeline ruptures and discharges of toxic gases 
if any of these events occur  we could incur substantial losses as a result of injury or loss of life  severe damage to and destruction of property  natural resources and equipment  pollution and other environmental damage  clean up responsibilities  regulatory investigation and penalties  suspension of our operations and repairs to resume operations 
if we experience any of these problems  it could affect well bores  platforms  gathering systems and processing facilities  which could adversely affect our ability to conduct operations 
offshore operations are also subject to a variety of operating risks specific to the marine environment  such as capsizing  collisions and damage or loss from hurricanes or other adverse weather conditions 
these conditions can cause substantial damage to facilities and interrupt production 
as a result  we could incur substantial liabilities that could reduce or eliminate the funds available for exploration  development or leasehold acquisitions  or result in loss of equipment and properties 
for some risks  we may not obtain insurance if we believe the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented 
in addition  pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable 
if a significant accident or other event occurs and is not fully covered by insurance  it could adversely affect our operations 
exploration for oil and gas at deeper drilling depths and in the deep waters of the gulf of mexico involves greater operational and financial risks than exploration at shallower depths and in shallower waters 
these risks could result in substantial losses 
we explore for oil and gas at deeper drilling depths and in the deep waters of the gulf of mexico where operations are more difficult and costly than at shallower depths and in shallower waters 
deep depth and deepwater drilling and operations require the application of recently developed technologies that involve a higher risk of mechanical failure 
we have experienced and will continue to experience significantly higher drilling costs for deep depth and deepwater prospects 
as of december   approximately of our proved undeveloped reserves were located in deep water 
the deep water lacks the physical and oilfield service infrastructure present in the shallower waters 
as a result  deepwater projects require long term commitments of significant financial resources 
deepwater operations may also require a significant amount of time between the discovery date and the initial production date when we can market the oil or gas  increasing both the financial and operational risk involved with these operations 
spinnaker is vulnerable to operational  regulatory and other risks associated with the gulf of mexico because we currently explore and produce exclusively in that area 
our operations and revenues are impacted acutely by conditions in the gulf of mexico because we currently explore and produce exclusively in that area 
this concentration of activity makes us more vulnerable than many of our competitors to the risks associated with the gulf of mexico  including delays and increased costs relating to adverse weather conditions  drilling rig and other oilfield services and compliance with environmental and other laws and regulations 
a significant part of the value of our production and reserves is concentrated in a small number of offshore properties 
because of this concentration  any production problems or inaccuracies in reserve estimates related to those properties are more likely to adversely impact our business 
during  approximately of our production came from seven properties in the gulf of mexico 
if mechanical problems  storms or other events curtailed a substantial portion of this production  our cash flow 
table of contents would be adversely affected 
in addition  as of december   our proved reserves were located on different blocks in the gulf of mexico  with of the proved reserves attributable to seven of these properties 
one property  front runner  accounted for approximately of total proved undeveloped reserves and of total proved reserves 
if the actual reserves associated with any one of these seven properties are substantially less than the estimated reserves  spinnaker s results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
rules and regulations of the commission allow companies to recognize proved reserves if economic producibility is supported by either actual production or a conclusive formation test 
in the absence of a production flow test  compelling technical data must exist to recognize proved reserves 
the industry has increasingly depended on advanced technical testing to support economic producibility 
spinnaker has recorded most of its proved reserves in deep water based on various advanced technical tests rather than production flow tests 
we expect initial production from the majority of our proved undeveloped reserves in the deep water in the second half of if any seismic contractor terminates its data agreement with spinnaker  our ability to find additional reserves could be impaired 
our success depends heavily on access to d seismic data 
if any seismic contractor terminates its data agreement with us  we would lose access to a portion of the d seismic data  which loss could have an adverse effect on our ability to find additional reserves 
a seismic contractor may terminate its data agreement with us on several grounds  including if a competitor of the seismic contractor acquires control of spinnaker or if we breach the data agreement with that seismic contractor  subject to certain exceptions 
see item business seismic data agreements termination events for a description of these exceptions 
competitors may use superior technology which we may be unable to afford or which would require costly investments in order to compete 
the industry is subject to rapid and significant advancements in technology  including the introduction of new products and services using new technologies 
as competitors use or develop new technologies  we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage  and competitive pressures may force us to implement new technologies at a substantial cost 
in addition  competitors may have greater financial  technical and personnel resources that allow them to enjoy technological advantages and may in the future allow them to implement new technologies before we can 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to implement technologies on a timely basis or at a cost that is acceptable to us 
one or more of the technologies that spinnaker currently uses or that we may implement in the future may become obsolete  which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
for example  marine seismic acquisition technology has undergone rapid technological advancements in recent years and further significant technological developments could substantially impair the value of our d seismic data 
reserve estimates depend on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate 
any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or their underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and net present value of spinnaker s reserves 
the process of estimating oil and gas reserves is complex 
it requires interpretations of available technical data and various assumptions  including assumptions relating to economic factors 
any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations or assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantities and net present value of reserves 
see item properties oil and gas reserves 
ryder scott prepares spinnaker s reserve estimates as of june and december each year 
in order to assist in the preparation of these estimates  we must project production rates and timing of development expenditures 
we must also analyze available geological  geophysical  production and engineering data  and the extent  quality and reliability of this data can vary 
the process also requires economic assumptions such as oil 
table of contents and gas prices  drilling and operating expenses  capital expenditures  taxes and the availability of funds 
even though our reserve estimates are prepared by an independent third party  these estimates of oil and gas reserves are still inherently imprecise 
actual future production  oil and gas prices  revenues  taxes  development expenditures  operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves most likely will vary from our estimates 
any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and net present value of reserves 
in addition  estimates of proved reserves may be adjusted to reflect production history  results of exploration and development  prevailing oil and gas prices and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
moreover  some of the producing wells included in the reserve report had produced for only a relatively short period of time as of december  because most of the reserve estimates are not based on a lengthy production history and are calculated using volumetric analysis  these estimates are less reliable than estimates based on a lengthy production history 
it should not be assumed that the present value of future net cash flows from our proved reserves is the current market value of our estimated oil and gas reserves 
in accordance with commission requirements  we base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves on prices and costs on the date of the estimate 
actual future prices and costs may differ materially from those used in the present value of future net cash flows estimate 
the failure to replace reserves would adversely affect our production and cash flows 
spinnaker s future oil and gas production depends on our success in finding or acquiring additional reserves 
if we fail to replace reserves  our level of production and cash flows would be adversely impacted 
in general  production from oil and gas properties declines as reserves are depleted  with the rate of decline depending on reservoir characteristics and mechanical issues 
total proved reserves will decline as reserves are produced unless we conduct other successful exploration and development activities or acquire properties containing proved reserves  or both 
our ability to make the necessary capital investment to maintain or expand its asset base of oil and gas reserves would be impaired to the extent cash flow from operations is reduced and external sources of capital become limited or unavailable 
we may not be successful in exploring for  developing or acquiring additional reserves 
if we are not successful  our future production and revenues will be adversely affected 
relatively short rates of production for gulf of mexico properties compared to other producing regions of the world subject us to more active reserve replacement efforts  require us to incur capital expenditures more frequently to replace production and generate growth in reserves and may impair our ability to slow or shut in production during periods of low prices for oil and gas 
reservoirs in the gulf of mexico are generally sandstone reservoirs characterized by high porosity  permeability  pressure and temperature 
production of these reservoirs is generally constant for a relatively shorter period of time with a rapid decline in production at the end of the reservoir life compared to production of reservoirs in many other producing regions of the world 
as a result  our reserve replacement needs from new prospects in the gulf of mexico are greater and require us to incur capital expenditures more frequently to replace production than would typically be required in many other producing regions of the world 
we expect a decline in production in the first quarter of due to the rapid production decline of certain producing wells  timing related to first production from recent shelf discoveries and shut ins for facility work not related to our properties 
also  revenues and return on capital will depend significantly on oil and gas prices during these relatively short production periods 
the potential need to generate revenues to fund ongoing capital commitments or reduce future indebtedness may limit our ability to slow or shut in production from producing wells in the future during periods of low prices for oil and gas 
natural gas and oil prices fluctuate widely  and low prices could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results 
our revenues  profitability and future growth depend substantially on prevailing oil and gas prices 
prices also affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow and raise 
table of contents additional capital 
the amount we can borrow under the revolver is subject to periodic re determination based in part on changing expectations of future prices 
lower prices may also reduce the amount of oil and gas that we can economically produce 
prices for natural gas and oil fluctuate widely 
among the factors that can cause this fluctuation are the level of consumer product demand  weather conditions  domestic and foreign governmental regulations  the price and availability of alternative fuels  political conditions in oil and gas producing regions  the domestic and foreign supply of oil and gas  the price of foreign imports and overall economic conditions 
if natural gas and oil prices decline  even if for only a short period of time  it is possible that write downs of oil and gas properties could occur in the future 
hedging production has limited and may continue to limit potential gains from increases in commodity prices or result in losses 
spinnaker enters into hedging arrangements from time to time to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in natural gas and oil prices and to achieve more predictable cash flow 
these financial arrangements take the form of swap contracts or cashless collars and are placed with major trading counterparties we believe represent minimum credit risks 
we cannot provide assurance that these trading counterparties will not become credit risks in the future 
hedging arrangements expose us to risks in some circumstances  including situations when the other party to the hedging contract defaults on its contract obligations or there is a change in the expected differential between the underlying price in the hedging agreement and actual prices received 
these hedging arrangements have limited and may continue to limit the benefit we could receive from increases in the prices for natural gas and oil 
we cannot provide assurance that the hedging transactions we have entered into  or will enter into  will adequately protect us from fluctuations in natural gas and oil prices 
we may choose not to engage in hedging transactions in the future 
as a result  spinnaker may be adversely affected during periods of declining natural gas and oil prices 
spinnaker s success depends on our chief executive officer and other key personnel  the loss of who could disrupt business operations 
we depend to a large extent on the efforts and continued employment of our president and chief executive officer  roger l 
jarvis  and other key personnel 
if mr 
jarvis or other key personnel resign or become unable to continue in their present role and if they are not adequately replaced  spinnaker s business operations could be adversely affected 
spinnaker is subject to complex laws and regulations  including environmental regulations  which can adversely affect the cost  manner or feasibility of doing business 
exploration for and development  production and sale of oil and gas in the us and especially in the gulf of mexico are subject to extensive federal  state and local laws and regulations  including environmental laws and regulations 
we may be required to make large expenditures to comply with environmental and other governmental regulations 
matters subject to regulation include discharge permits for drilling operations  drilling bonds  reports concerning operations and taxation 
under these laws and regulations  spinnaker could be liable for personal injuries  property damage  oil spills  discharge of hazardous materials  remediation and clean up costs and other environmental damages 
we do not believe that full insurance coverage for all potential environmental damages is available at a reasonable cost 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in the suspension or termination of our operations and subject us to administrative  civil and criminal penalties 
moreover  these laws and regulations could change in ways that substantially increase costs 
for example  congress or the mms could decide to limit exploratory drilling or natural gas production in additional areas of the gulf of mexico 
accordingly  any of these liabilities  penalties  suspensions  terminations or regulatory changes could materially and adversely affect spinnaker s financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents competition in the industry is intense  and spinnaker is smaller and has a more limited operating history than most of our competitors in the gulf of mexico 
we compete with major and independent oil and gas companies for property acquisitions 
we also compete for the equipment and labor required to operate and develop our properties 
most of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do 
as a result  in the deep water where exploration is more expensive  competitors may be better able to withstand sustained periods of unsuccessful drilling 
in addition  larger competitors may be able to absorb the burden of any changes in federal  state and local laws and regulations more easily than we can  which would adversely affect our competitive position 
these competitors may be able to pay more for exploratory prospects and productive oil and gas properties and may be able to define  evaluate  bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than we can 
our ability to explore for oil and gas prospects and to acquire additional properties in the future will depend on our ability to conduct operations  to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in this highly competitive environment 
in addition  most of the competitors have been operating in the gulf of mexico for a much longer time than spinnaker has and have demonstrated the ability to operate through industry cycles 
we cannot control the activities on properties we do not operate 
other companies operate some of the properties in which we have an interest  including front runner 
as a result  we have a limited ability to exercise influence over operations for these properties or their associated costs 
our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these projects and our limited ability to influence operations and associated costs could materially and adversely affect the realization of targeted returns on capital in drilling or acquisition activities 
the success and timing of drilling and development activities on properties operated by others therefore depend upon a number of factors that are outside of our control  including timing and amount of capital expenditures  the operator s expertise and financial resources  approval of other participants in drilling wells and selection of technology 
we may have difficulty financing our planned growth 
we have experienced and expect to continue to experience substantial capital expenditure and working capital needs  particularly as a result of our drilling program 
in the future  we expect that we will require additional financing  in addition to cash generated from operations  to fund planned growth 
we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms or at all 
in the event additional capital resources are unavailable  we may curtail drilling  development and other activities or be forced to sell some of our assets on an untimely or unfavorable basis 
warburg owns a significant number of shares of common stock  giving it influence in corporate transactions and other matters  and the interests of warburg could differ from those of other stockholders 
at december   warburg owned approximately of the outstanding shares of common stock 
as a result  warburg is in a position to significantly influence the outcome of matters requiring a stockholder vote  including the election of directors  the adoption of an amendment to the certificate of incorporation or bylaws and the approval of mergers and other significant corporate transactions 
warburg s influence over spinnaker may delay or prevent a change of control of spinnaker and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of other stockholders 
furthermore  conflicts of interest could arise in the future between spinnaker and warburg concerning  among other things  potential competitive business activities or business opportunities 
warburg is not restricted from competitive oil and gas exploration and production activities or investments 
warburg currently has significant equity interests in other public and private oil and gas companies 
the interests of warburg could differ from those of other stockholders 

table of contents a portion of our outstanding shares owned by warburg or other significant stockholders may be sold into the market in the near future 
this could cause the market price of the common stock to drop significantly  even if our business is doing well 
the market price of the common stock could drop due to sales of a large number of shares of common stock in the market or the perception that such sales could occur 
this could make it more difficult to raise funds through any future offering of common stock 
the certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could discourage an acquisition or change of control of spinnaker 
the certificate of incorporation authorizes the board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval 
if the board of directors elects to issue preferred stock  it could be more difficult for a third party to acquire control of spinnaker  even if that change of control might be beneficial to stockholders 
in addition  provisions of the certificate of incorporation and bylaws  such as no stockholder action by written consent and limitations on stockholder proposals at meetings of stockholders  could also make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of spinnaker 
terrorist attacks on oil and gas production facilities  transportation systems and storage facilities could have a material adverse impact on our business 
oil and gas production facilities  transportation systems and storage facilities could be targets of terrorist attacks 
these attacks could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows if certain oil and gas infrastructure integral to our operations were destroyed or damaged

we use a risk weighted model to calculate budgeted capital expenditures on a project by project basis 
if we experience greater than anticipated success on budgeted projects  capital expenditures will increase 
net additions to property and equipment in were million  including asset retirement costs of million 
we incurred capital expenditures of approximately million in related to deepwater development activities  including million associated with the deepwater discovery at front runner 
inception to date capital expenditures through december  on the front runner project were million 
as of december   we expect to incur approximately million in future development costs related to front runner  including approximately million in and million thereafter 
natural gas and oil prices have a significant impact on our cash flows available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow and raise additional capital 
the amount we can borrow under the revolver is subject to semi annual re determination based in part on changing expectations of future prices 
lower prices may also reduce the amount of natural gas and oil that we can economically produce 
lower prices and or lower production may decrease revenues  cash flows and the borrowing base under the revolver  thus reducing the amount of financial resources available to meet our capital requirements 
we believe that cash flows from operations  proceeds from available borrowings under the revolver and front runner spar production facility financing opportunities will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements in the next twelve months 
however  additional debt or equity financing may be required in the future to fund growth and exploration and development activities 
in the event additional capital resources are unavailable  we may curtail drilling  development and other activities or be forced to sell some of our assets on an untimely or unfavorable basis 
as of december   we had borrowings of million and were in compliance with the covenants and restrictive provisions under the revolver 
subsequent to december   we borrowed an additional million and expect to incur additional borrowings under the revolver in spinnaker has an effective shelf registration statement relating to the potential public offer and sale by us or certain of our affiliates of up to million of any combination of debt securities  preferred stock  common stock  warrants  stock purchase contracts and trust preferred securities from time to time or when financing needs arise 
the registration statement does not provide assurance that we will or could sell any such securities

we sell our natural gas and oil production under fixed or floating market price contracts 
spinnaker enters into hedging arrangements from time to time to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in natural gas and oil prices and to achieve more predictable cash flow 
however  these contracts also limit the benefits we would realize if prices increase 
see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december   spinnaker had negative working capital of million 
our cash flow from operations depends on our ability to manage working capital  including accounts receivable  accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
the net decrease of million in accounts receivable was primarily related to decreases of million in joint interest billings and million in oil and gas revenues receivable 
joint interest billings fluctuate from period to period based on the number of wells operated by spinnaker and the timing of billings to and collections from other working interest owners 
oil and gas revenues receivable decreased primarily due to lower production in december compared to december  offset in part by higher commodity prices in december other current assets decreased million primarily due to a lower deferred tax asset related to hedging liabilities at the end of compared to accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased million
