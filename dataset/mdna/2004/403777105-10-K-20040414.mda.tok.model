general the gymboree corporation is an international specialty retailer operating stores selling high quality apparel and accessories  as well as play programs for women and children under the gymboree  janie and jack  janeville and gymboree play music brands 
as of january   the company conducted its business through three primary divisions gymboree  janie and jack  and gymboree play music 
as of january   we had stores  including stores in the united states including janie and jack shops  stores in canada and stores in europe 
the company also operates two on line stores at www 
gymboree 
com and www 
janieandjack 
com 
the company s net sales for increased to from million in and million in our net income totaled million in compared to million in and million in comparable store net sales  based on a week period  increased during versus  during versus  and during versus a number of factors positively affected our operating results in we increased our store base by stores  including the addition of new janie and jack shops 
we offered additional product variety in our gymboree stores  including more frequent delivery of new product lines  expanded size options  and a new baby basics line 
we began offering more fashion items at our janie and jack shops 
we also controlled our costs  by focusing on expense control and leveraging on our core infrastructure investments  which offset costs associated with our continued expansion of janie and jack and the development of janeville  our newest retail concept 
our results were negatively impacted by the underperformance of our gymboree boy business and the results of our play music division 
however  in  we took steps to improve the performance of these businesses 
we began redesigning lines to offer more fashion items for our gymboree baby and kid boy businesses in the fourth quarter of we also began to restructure our play music business in as part of our restructuring plan  we expect to sell all but of our company owned sites  which will be used primarily for training purposes 
in  we plan to continue to grow our store base for both gymboree and janie and jack  opening approximately and stores respectively 
in addition  we will launch our newest retail concept  janeville  in april  with the goal of opening a total of new stores by the end of year 
we will also continue to invest in gymboree retail stores  upgrading our fixture and merchandise display systems to better and more consistently display our products 
in addition  we plan on launching a co branded gymboree visa card with a compelling rewards program for our customers during the first quarter of  and we will continue to create cross promotional marketing programs between gymboree retail and gymboree play music in order to strengthen both brands 
we believe that our long term growth will depend on the development and implementation of new retail concepts  such as janie and jack and janeville  as well as the continued investment in our core retail franchise  gymboree retail stores 
as such  we expect to continue to devote time and effort in evaluating  developing  and testing new concepts when we perceive opportunities in the marketplace 
such efforts inevitably require significant management attention at all phases of the process and  for those concepts that we determine to launch  significant capital expenditures 
the company s year end is on the saturday closest to january fiscal  and  which included weeks each  ended on january   february  and february   respectively 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
we identified our most critical accounting policies and estimates to be those related to inventory valuation  asset impairment  workers compensation  sales return reserve and income taxes 
inventory valuation 
inventory is valued using the retail method of accounting and is stated at the lower of cost or market 
we review our inventory levels in order to identify slow moving merchandise and broken assortments items no longer in stock in a sufficient range of sizes and use markdowns to clear merchandise 
we estimate shortage for the period between the last physical count and the balance sheet date 
our shortage estimate can be affected by changes in merchandise mix and changes in actual shortage trends 
effective february   the company elected to change its method of inventory valuation from the retail method to the cost method 
the company believes the cost method is a preferable method for matching the cost of merchandise with the revenues generated 
the cumulative effect of this accounting change on the first quarter of will be a one time benefit of approximately million  net of tax 
asset impairment 
we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
if the undiscounted future cash flows from the long lived assets are less than the carrying value  we recognize a loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the assets 
decisions to close a store or facility can also result in accelerated depreciation over the revised useful life 
for locations to be closed which are under long term leases  we record a charge for lease buyout expense or the difference between our rent and the rate at which we expect to be able to sublease the properties and related cost  as appropriate 
most closures occur upon the lease expiration 
our estimate of future cash flows is based on our experience  knowledge and typically third party advice or market data 
however  these estimates can be affected by factors such as future store profitability  real estate demand and economic conditions that are difficult to predict 
workers compensation 
the company is partially self insured for workers compensation insurance 
the company records a liability for its deductible based on claims filed and an estimate of claims that may have been incurred but not reported 
if the actual amount of claims filed exceeds our estimates  reserves recorded may not be sufficient and additional accruals may be required in future periods 
sales return reserve 
the company records a reserve for estimated product returns based on historical return trends 
if actual returns are greater than those projected by management  additional sales returns may be recorded in the future 
income taxes 
we record reserves for estimates of probable settlements of domestic and foreign tax audits 
at any one time  many tax years are subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions 
the ultimate settlement amounts for these audits resulting from our negotiations with taxing authorities may differ from recorded reserves 
our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted by changes in the mix and level of earnings 
compared to net sales net retail sales for the fifty two weeks ended january  increased to million from million in the fifty two weeks ended february   an increase of million  or 
comparable store sales for the week period increased or million over the same week period last year 
the increase in comparable store sales was due to additional product variety offered by gymboree  including more frequent delivery of new product lines  expanded size options  and a new baby basics line 
the increase was also due to janie and jack shops offering more fashion items to accommodate customers requests 
these increases were offset by a decrease in comparable store sales from our gymboree boy business  as our strategy of emphasizing a larger basics product assortment while combining the styling of our baby and kid boy departments  was not successful 
in the fourth quarter of  we returned to offering distinct styling between our baby and kid boy departments and began to rebalance the mix of fashion and basics in our product assortment 
non comparable store sales increased million primarily due to net store and square footage growth of stores and  square feet  respectively 
the number of retail stores open at the end of the period was  compared to open at the end of the increase in net retail sales includes a million increase in shipping income resulting from the increase in our on line store business  as well as a million increase in sales to off price retailers 
we expect comparable store sales to be flat to slightly positive in  as a result of improvements made to our gymboree boy business 
play music net sales for the fifty two weeks ended january  decreased to million from million in the fifty two weeks ended february   a decrease of million or 
the decrease was primarily due to the closure of company owned sites  lower royalty payments and product sales by existing franchisees  as well as a decrease in new franchises and related equipment sales 
during  we began to restructure our play music business in order to increase future profitability and placed less emphasis on selling new franchises 
we ultimately plan to operate approximately company owned sites primarily for training purposes

as a percentage of net sales  gross profit decreased to from in the same period last year 
the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to the under performance of our gymboree boy business  lower initial markups at janie and jack shops  and the weak performance of our play music division due to the factors mentioned above 
we expect gross profit as a percentage of net sales to increase moderately in  primarily due to fewer planned promotional events and the expected improvement in our gymboree boy business 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses sg a  which principally consist of non occupancy store expenses  corporate overhead and distribution expenses  remained at million for the fifty two weeks ended january  as a percentage of net sales  sg a decreased to in compared to in the decrease in sg a as a percentage of net sales resulted primarily from lower incentive compensation  a decrease in direct mail marketing and lower shipping costs attributable to the consolidation of freight vendors 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in expenses related to new retail stores opened in we expect sg a as a percentage of net sales to increase slightly in due to growth in the gymboree store base and continued investment in janie and jack  janeville and play music 
the increase is primarily due to payroll and operating expenses at new stores  as well as higher distribution expenses associated with increased unit deliveries to our stores 
we are also making strategic investments in our play music division  which will result in increased benefits and compensation expense 
foreign exchange gains losses  net net foreign exchange gains totaled  for the fifty two weeks ended january  compared to  for these gains resulted from currency fluctuations on inter company transactions between our united states operations and foreign subsidiaries 
the amount of foreign exchange gains or losses is dependent on both monthly currency fluctuations and inter company balances
