item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
introduction 
fonar was formed in to engage in the business of designing  manufacturing and selling mri scanners 
in  we formed a wholly owned subsidiary  health management corporation of america  also referred to as hmca  formerly known as us health management corporation  in order to expand into the physician and diagnostic management services business 
fonar s principal mri products are its stand up tm mri and fonar tm mri scanners 
the stand up tm mri allows patients to be scanned for the first time under weight bearing conditions 
the company has been aggressively seeking new sales and during fiscal and  respectively received orders for and stand up tm mri scanners 
the stand up tm mri is the only mri capable of producing images in the weight bearing state 
at tesla field strength  the stand up tm mri and fonar tm magnets are among the highest field open mri scanners in the industry  offering non claustrophobic mri together with high field image quality 
fonar s open mri scanners were the first high field strength mri scanners in the industry 
hmca commenced operations in july  and generates revenues from providing comprehensive management services  including development  administration  accounting  billing and collection services  together with office space  medical equipment  supplies and non medical personnel to its clients 
revenues are in the form of fees which are earned under contracts with mri facilities and physical rehabilitation practices 
since april  hmca no longer engages in the management of primary care medical practices 
all of hmca s revenues for the fiscal year ended june  and of hmca s revenues for the fiscal years ended june   june   were derived from contracts with facilities and practices owned by dr 
raymond v 
damadian  the president of fonar and hmca and principal stockholder of fonar 
the agreements with the mri facilities are for one year terms which renew automatically on an annual basis  unless terminated 
the fees are based on the number of procedures performed and currently range from to per mri scan 
the fees are reviewed and if appropriate  adjusted on an annual basis by mutual agreement 
the agreements with the physical rehabilitation practices  which were executed in  provide for a term of years 
the fees are fixed monthly fees adjusted annually 
historically  adjustments have been on the basis of changes in hmca s costs  plus a percentage of costs 
currently  the monthly fees under these contracts with the physical rehabilitation practices range from approximately  to  prior to hmca s diversiture of a a services  inc  which managed the medical practices  the monthly fees under the contracts with the medical practices were  during fiscal critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to investments  intangible assets  income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we recognize revenue and related costs of revenue from sales contracts for our mri scanners  under the percentage of completion method 
under this method  we recognize revenue and related costs of revenue  as each sub assembly is completed 
amounts received in advance of our commencement of production are recorded as customer advances 
we recognize revenue from license agreements for our intellectual property over the shorter of the contractual life of the license or the estimated economic life 
for our current license agreement  we are recognizing revenue ratably over years 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
as of june   we recorded a valuation allowance which reduced our deferred tax assets to equal our deferred tax liability 
we amortize our intangible assets  including patents  purchased management agreements and capitalized software development costs  over the shorter of the contractual legal life or the estimated economic life 
our amortization life for patents  purchased management agreements and capitalized software development costs is to years  years and years  respectively 
we periodically assess the recoverability of long lived assets  including property and equipment  intangibles and management agreements  when there are indications of potential impairment  based on estimates of undiscounted future cash flows 
the amount of impairment is calculated by comparing anticipated discounted future cash flows with the carrying value of the related asset 
in performing this analysis  management considers such factors as current results  trends  and future prospects  in addition to other economic factors 
during the year ended june   we recorded an impairment loss of  related to the management contracts in our physician s management services segment with the primary care medical practices 
in april   we sold a a services  inc  the subsidiary which held those contracts  back to the original sellers for a purchase price of million 
in addition  the buyers released hmca from the balance of its indebtedness remaining due on the original purchase  in the amount of  as depreciated assets attributed to these contracts was  we recognized a gain of  on the transaction 
these amounts have been reflected as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
results of operations 
fiscal compared to fiscal in fiscal  we experienced a net loss of million on revenues of million  as compared to a net loss of million on revenues of million for fiscal this represents a decrease in the net loss of and an increase in revenues of 
this was due in part to the fact that while revenues increased by  total costs and expenses increased by only 
our consolidated operating loss decreased by to million for fiscal as compared to an operating loss of million for fiscal discussion of operating results of medical equipment segment fiscal compared to fiscal revenues attributable to our medical equipment segment increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  reflecting an increase in product sales of  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and an increase in service revenue of  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this improvement in revenues was attributable to our increase in sales of our stand up tm mri  which is unique in that it permits mri scans to be performed on patients upright in the weight bearing state and in multiple positions that correlate with symptoms 
the increase in service revenue is a result primarily of our increase scanner base  as scanners sold in previous years become service customers after the warranty period expires 
during the fiscal years ended june  and june   respectively  we received orders for and stand up tm mri scanners 
confirming our expectation of increased demand for our mri scanners  product sales to unrelated parties increased by in fiscal from million in fiscal to million in fiscal product sales to related parties decreased  however  by in fiscal from million in fiscal to million in fiscal we believe that our principal challenges in achieving greater market penetration are attributable to the better name recognition and larger sales forces of our larger competitors such as general electric  siemens  hitachi  philips and toshiba and the ability of some of our competitors to offer attractive financing terms through affiliates  such as ge capital 
nevertheless  no other competitor offers a whole body weight bearing mri scanner such as the stand up tm mri  and the general electric medical systems division of general electric acts as a manufacturer s representative for the stand up tm mri 
we believe that our continuing increase in unrelated party sales shows that we are successfully meeting that challenge 
sales to related parties in fiscal were adversely affected  however  by the bankruptcy during the year of their primary financing source  which had to be replaced 
we anticipate that the trend of increased sales to unrelated parties relative to sales to related parties will continue to increase as we increase our penetration of the general market 
the operating loss for the medical equipment segment improved by from a loss of million in fiscal to a loss of million in fiscal this improvement is attributable to our continuing increase in gross margins on our scanner sales 
we recognized revenues of million from the sale of our stand up tm mri scanners in fiscal in fiscal  we recognized revenues of million from the sale of stand up tm mri scanners  and  from the sale of one refurbished  used  beta tm scanner 
we no longer manufacture beta tm scanners 
sales of mri scanners to affiliated parties  consisting of professional corporations and other entities in which dr 
damadian or members of his family have an interest represented approximately  or million  of our revenues in fiscal  as compared to  or million  of our revenues in fiscal license and royalty revenue declined by to approximately million in fiscal from approximately million in fiscal gross profit margins on product sales improved during fiscal from in fiscal to in fiscal the improvement was principally attributable to the medical equipment segment operating at a higher level of capacity resulting from the increased sales volume 
research and development expenses  net of capitalized costs  increased by to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal our expenses for fiscal represented continued research and development of fonar s scanners  fonar s new hardware and software product  sympulse tm and new surface coils to be used with the stand up tm mri scanner 
discussion of operating results of physician and diagnostic services management segment 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenues attributable to the company s physician and diagnostic services management segment  hmca  increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the reversal of the decline in revenues reflected anticipated increases in revenues provided by upgraded facilities offsetting the closing of underperforming facilities 
presently  four mri facilities managed by hmca have stand up tm mri scanners and additional upgrades are planned 
cost of revenues as a percentage of the related revenues for our physician and diagnostic services management segment increased from million or of related revenues for the year ended june  to million  or of related revenue for the year ended june  operating results of this segment improved from an operating loss of million in fiscal to operating income of  in fiscal in the fourth quarter of fiscal  hmca recognized an impairment loss of  on certain management agreements with a physical rehabilitation and therapy facility which was closed in the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal we attribute the improvement to hmca s focus on upgrading the more promising sites it manages such as the introduction of stand up tm mri scanners at mri facilities 
discussion of consolidated results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal we recognized interest income of  in as compared to  in fiscal  representing a decrease of 
the decrease was attributable primarily to a decrease in interest on our investments in marketable securities and a decrease in interest income from related parties 
interest expense of  was recognized in fiscal decreasing from  in fiscal and representing a decrease of 
the decrease was attributable primarily to the repayment of debt and capital lease obligations in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was attributable primarily to the expansion of fonar s increased manufacturing  advertising  marketing and sales activity 
commencing in fiscal  we engaged the services of an advertising agency and introduced television and radio advertising 
the decrease in compensatory element of stock issuances from approximately million in fiscal to million in fiscal reflected the continued but reduced use of fonar s stock bonus plan to pay certain highly compensated employees and others in stock rather than in cash 
the lower provision for bad debt of  in fiscal as compared to  in fiscal  reflected a decrease in reserves and write offs of certain receivables 
the amortization expense of  in fiscal and  in fiscal  reflects the amortization of management agreements attributable to hmca s acquisitions 
we are enthusiastic about the future of our stand up tm mri and fonar tm scanners which bring a new plateau of openness to diagnostic mri and are expected to bring a new frontier in performing mri guided intervention 
we believe our new products are beginning to successfully penetrate the market  as reflected in the dramatic increase in product sales from approximately million in fiscal to million in fiscal  to million in fiscal  to million in fiscal and in fiscal most of the revenues on the stand up tm mri scanners sold in the last quarter of fiscal  were not recognized as of june   and as of june   our balance sheet reflects million in customer advances  as compared to million in customer advances as at june  in addition to our success with our stand up tm mri  we sold our first fonar tm in the first quarter of fiscal in addition to increased product sales  the service and repair fees have steadily increased  as reflected by the increase in service and repair fees from million in fiscal to million in fiscal to million in fiscal to million in fiscal and million in fiscal continuing our tradition as the originator of mri  we remain committed to maintaining our position as a leading innovator of the industry through aggressive investing in research and development 
in fiscal we continued our investment in the development of our new mri scanners  together with software and upgrades  with an investment of  in research and development   of which was capitalized  as compared to   of which was capitalized  in fiscal the research and development expenditures were approximately of revenues attributable to our medical equipment segment  and of total revenues  in and of medical equipment segment revenues  and of total revenues in fiscal this represented a increase in research and development expenditures in fiscal as compared to fiscal and our significantly higher total revenues and medical equipment revenues which have resulted from our greater emphasis on marketing and selling 
in summary  fonar continued the trend of steadily increasing mri scanner sales  most dramatically the increase in stand up tm mri scanner sales from fiscal through fiscal we anticipate that the increase in scanner sales will continue due to the unique capability of the stand up tm mri scanner to scan patients in weight bearing positions and future sales of the fonar tm for image guided interventional procedures and treatments 
service revenues have also increased over the past five fiscal years 
the physician and diagnostic services management segment  hmca  revenues reversed their decline in the same period  from in fiscal to million in fiscal to in fiscal and million in fiscal we have reversed the decline in hmca revenues by closing unprofitable facilities and continuing our program of replacing the mri scanners at the mri facilities we manage with stand up tm mri scanners 
stand up tm mri scanners are now installed in the sites we manage in islandia  new york  bensonhurst  new york  staten island  new york and boca raton  florida 
the next managed facilities which we plan to install stand up tm mri scanners are in east elmhurst  new york  and daytona  florida 
our longer range plans involve managing new mri facilities clustered in selected television and radio media areas in major metropolitan areas throughout the country 
expenditures for advertising and marketing are likely to increase  as the company continues its efforts to promote sales

research and development expenses  net of capitalized costs  increased by to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal our expenses for fiscal represented continued research and development of fonar s scanners  its new hardware and software product  sympulse tm and new surface coils to be used within the stand up tm mri scanner 
discussion of operating results of physician management services segment 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenues attributable to our physician and diagnostic services management segment hmca decreased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease in revenues reflected a decline in mri scan volume prior to upgrading older scanners and the closing of certain facilities managed by hmca
