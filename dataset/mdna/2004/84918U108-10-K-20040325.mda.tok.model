cumulative effect of accounting change for goodwill in june  the financial accounting standard board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas requires goodwill to be subject to annual impairment testing instead of amortization 
we adopted this standard effective january  if the carrying value of goodwill or an intangible exceeds it fair value  an impairment loss is recognized 
we engaged an independent appraisal company who used a discounted cash flow model to determine the fair value of our businesses for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment 
the discount rate used was based on a risk adjusted weighted average cost of capital for each business 
the effect of adopting this new standard resulted in a cumulative effect of an accounting change of approximately  or 
per basic and diluted share for an impairment loss on goodwill 
 of the impairment loss was attributable to our truck accessories business and  was associated with our racetrack operations 
in addition  the adoption eliminated annual amortization expense of approximately  or 
per share 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in appendix a 
risk factors general ownership of our common stock is concentrated in one shareholder  who is able to exercise control and make decisions that may not be in the best interest of all of our shareholders donald j 
williamson  our majority shareholder and his wife  patsy williamson  own approximately of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock 
accordingly  donald and patsy williamson are able to control the election of directors and all other matters which are subject to a vote of shareholders 
this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of sports resorts international  inc even if this change of control would benefit all of the shareholders 
our future success will be dependent on the skill of our key personnel our success depends upon the availability and performance of our officers and senior management and other key personnel 
we rely heavily upon the expertise of a relatively small core of executives 
we do not have employment agreements with any of our key personnel 
the loss of the services of one or more of our key executives could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
our common stock has a limited trading market  which may make it difficult to sell or obtain an adequate price for your shares there is a limited public market for our common stock and there is no assurance that an active trading market will develop or be sustained 
because of this lack of liquidity  our stock price may be highly volatile 
fluctuations in interest rates could increase our borrowing costs and adversely affect our financial results in the event we borrow money in the future  we may be exposed to changes in interest rates 
our credit facilities are usually based on the prime rate of interest and may not necessarily be the lowest rate of interest 
if the interest rates charged by our lenders increase  there could be an adverse effect on our financial results 
truck accessories segment our profitability is dependent on control of our costs  in the event we are unable to control our costs  our financial results could be adversely affected in order to manufacture our truck accessories we require plastic resin as a raw material 
the cost of plastic resin is directly dependent upon fluctuations in natural gas feedstock prices 
we do not have any long term supply contracts and do not use any hedging techniques to manage the costs of plastic resin 
in the event raw material prices increase  we may be unable to pass the increased costs on to our customers which could adversely affect our results of operations 
in addition  we attempt to control our labor costs 
in the event that the cost of labor increases and we are unable to pass such increased labor costs to our customers  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
our truck accessories business faces strong competition which could affect our sales and profit margins we compete for sales of bedliners and other truck accessories against a number of companies 
many of these companies are larger  have greater market recognition and substantially greater financial  technical  marketing  distribution and other resources than we have 
additionally  new and alternative product offerings are increasingly available 
while product quality is an important factor  price and features are also very important to our customers 
we attempt to manufacture high quality  full featured products  which are cost competitive 
we have faced and will continue to face additional competition from new entrants and alternative products into our markets 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to compete successfully with existing or new competitors or products 
the effects of inflation could adversely affect our financial results if our costs increase faster than we can pass them on to our customers the relatively moderate rate of inflation experienced during the last decade has not had a significant impact on our results of operations 
however  there can be no assurance that a moderate rate of inflation will continue 
in the event the rate of inflation increases more dramatically in the future  our costs may increase faster than we can pass them on to our customers which would have an adverse effect on our financial results 
our truck accessory business is tied to the north american vehicle industry  which is highly cyclical and dependent on consumer spending and general economic conditions in north america sales of our truck accessories including bedliners is tied to the north american vehicle industry 
the truck industry is highly cyclical and dependent on consumer spending and general economic conditions in north america 
we only sell our truck accessories in the united states and as result we are solely dependent on the health and vitality of the u 
s 
economy for our success 
there can be no assurance that production of pickup trucks will not decline in the future or that we will be able to fully utilize our manufacturing capacity 
economic factors adversely affecting truck sales and production and consumer spending could adversely impact our sales and operating results 
sports and entertainment segment we need to maintain and enhance our working relationship with the nhra in order to be successful  our raceway operation needs to maintain a good relationship with the primary sanctioning body of our racing events  the national hot rod association nhra 
while we believe that we have a good relationship with the nhra  and the current term of our sanctioning agreement has been extended to december   it is likely that the loss of the national race with the nhra would adversely affect the results of our operations 
our raceway operations face competition for ticket sales and marketing and advertising dollars we compete for marketing  advertising and ticket sales with other sports and with other entertainment and recreational activities 
in the event fan interest in racing declines  it is likely that our results of operations would be adversely affected 
we compete with well established raceway operations some of which have greater market recognition and substantially greater financial  technical  marketing  distribution and other resources than we have 
our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors  which are primarily outside our control including our ability to develop and maintain effective marketing programs  the number and location of our competitors and general market and economic conditions 
we may incur liability for personal injuries racing events can be dangerous to participants and to spectators 
we maintain insurance policies that provide coverage within limits that in our judgement are sufficient to protect us from material financial loss due to liability for personal injuries sustained by or death of  spectators in the ordinary course of our business 
our insurance may not be adequate or available at all times and in all circumstances 
in the event damages for injuries sustained by our spectators exceed our liability coverage or our insurance company denies coverage  our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected to the extent claims and associated expenses exceed our insurance recoveries 
we will need additional financing which may or may not be available or which may dilute the ownership interest of current shareholders we have previously announced plans to develop a large sports and entertainment complex in mount morris township  michigan 
to date  we have been unable to obtain the necessary funding for this project and are currently evaluating our options 
if we cannot obtain sufficient capital to develop the complex we will need to consider an alternative plan 
our raceway operations are seasonal and therefore adverse weather can affect our results of operations our raceway operations primarily operate on the weekends from may through october 
in the event that adverse weather conditions curtail attendance at any of our races  it could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations 
our failure to properly manage mergers  acquisitions  dispositions and diversification into other lines of business could adversely affect our business recently  we announced that we have decided to expand the sports and entertainment aspects of our business 
in the future we may expand or contract our operations through mergers  acquisitions  dispositions and diversification 
these activities expose us to a number of special risks  including diversion of management s attention  failure to retain key personnel or customers of an acquired business  difficulties transitioning operations to accommodate new businesses or activities and limited experience in managing a large sports and entertainment enterprise 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to effectively manage these special risks
