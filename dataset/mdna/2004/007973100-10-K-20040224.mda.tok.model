table of contents overview we design  manufacture and support a group of key components and subsystems primarily for vacuum process systems 
our primary products are complex power conversion and control systems 
our products also control the flow of fluids into the process chambers  provide thermal control and sensing within the chamber  deposit thin films of diamond like carbon and clean the chamber 
our customers use our products in plasma based thin film processing equipment that is essential to the manufacture of  among other things semiconductor devices for electronics applications  flat panel displays for hand held devices  computer and television screens  compact discs  dvds and other digital storage media  optical coatings for architectural glass  eyeglasses and solar panels  and industrial laser and medical applications 
we also sell spare parts and repair services worldwide through our customer service and technical support organization 
we provide solutions to a diversity of markets and geographic regions 
however  we are focused on the semiconductor capital equipment industry  which accounted for approximately of our sales in  of our sales in and in we expect future sales to the semiconductor capital equipment industry to represent approximately to of our total revenue  depending upon the strength or weakness of industry cycles 
our sales to customers outside the united states represented approximately  and of our sales in  and  respectively 
we expect our international sales to continue to grow as a percentage of our total sales as more customers build or have their products built in lower cost regions outside of the united states 
in  and much of the semiconductor capital equipment industry experienced the steepest cutback in capital equipment purchases in industry history 
as a result  demand for our products from the semiconductor capital equipment industry declined substantially from the peak in  and we have incurred significant operating losses each quarter from the second quarter of through the third quarter of in mid  the semiconductor capital equipment industry entered the early stages of what appears to be a return to higher product demand and in the fourth quarter of  we generated positive operating income of approximately  we are focused on returning to sustained profitability and achieving operating cash flow breakeven 
to achieve this goal  we are in the process of developing a more variable operating model to allow us to remain profitable during industry downturns and continue to be successful during periods of expansion 
we are taking the following actions establishing a china based manufacturing facility  transitioning a portion of our supply base to tier asian suppliers  closing certain facilities and reducing our permanent headcount  and 
table of contents engaging contract manufacturers to manufacture certain products and components which were previously manufactured by us 
in april  we opened our  square foot china based manufacturing facility in shenzhen  china 
at the end of  approximately of our worldwide production was manufactured in china 
by the end of  we expect to have transitioned approximately of our power and flow control manufacturing production to china 
during the transition period we are running duplicate manufacturing facilities  which is placing pressure on our gross margin 
we expect our gross margin to improve throughout if industry conditions continue to improve 
we plan to transition approximately of our raw material purchasing to tier asian suppliers 
as of december   approximately of our purchasing has been successfully transitioned and we expect to transition the remaining by december  our biggest obstacle in our tier supplier initiative is complying with certain major customers stringent copy exact requirements 
we are working closely with our largest original equipment manufacturers  or oem s  to ensure the transition proceeds on schedule 
however  our transition goals may prove difficult to realize because of customer needs 
during  we closed manufacturing facilities in longmont  colorado  matthews  north carolina  and austin  texas 
in the first half of  we plan to close our manufacturing facility in voorhees  new jersey 
we expect to incur between  and  in restructuring charges in  however  this estimate is subject to change based upon changes in the demand for our products and potential changes to our operating model 
we also closed various sales and services locations throughout the world in an effort to rationalize our manufacturing capacity and sales force with the current industry environment 
in the second quarter of  as part of our ongoing cost reduction measures  we engaged a contract manufacturer to manufacture printed circuit boards for our direct current  radio frequency and computer workstation products 
in the third quarter of  we sold our longmont  colorado manufacturing facility to a contract manufacturer who continues to use this facility to manufacture our industrial flow products 
critical accounting policies and estimates the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
in preparing our financial statements  we must make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents valuation of intangible assets and goodwill we have approximately million of intangible assets and goodwill as of december   including approximately million related to amortizable intangibles and million in goodwill 
in addition to the original cost of these assets  their recorded value is impacted by a number of our policy elections  including estimated useful lives and impairment charges  as well as foreign currency fluctuations 
due to our cost reduction initiatives we have restructured our business 
as a result we have eliminated certain duplicative facilities and consolidated the operational and administrative activities of our reporting units 
based on our similar production characteristics  shared manufacturing facilities and blended financial reporting environment  our management reviews our results of operations as a single reporting unit 
we review our intangible assets and goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could indicate impairment include under performance relative to historical or expected future operating results  changes in the manner of our use of the asset or the strategy for our overall business and negative industry or general economic trends 
in the fourth quarter of  we engaged a third party valuation firm to perform the annual impairment analysis of our non amortizable intangible assets and goodwill  which indicated that no charge for impairment was currently required 
this assessment required estimates of future revenue  operating results and cash flows  as well as estimates of critical valuation inputs such as discount rates  terminal values and similar data 
these projections of future results are by their nature subjective  and while they represent management s current best assessment of the future  they may be materially different than actual future results 
we will continue to perform impairment analyses of our non amortizable intangible assets and goodwill resulting from our acquisitions 
as a result of future periodic  at least annual  impairment analyses we may record impairment charges that would have a material adverse impact on our operating results 
additionally  we may make strategic business decisions in future periods which impact the fair value of our intangible assets and goodwill  which could result in significant impairment charges 
long lived assets including intangibles subject to amortization depreciation and amortization of our long lived assets is provided using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives 
changes in circumstances such as the passage of new laws or changes in regulations  technological advances  changes to our business model or changes in our strategy could result in the actual useful lives differing from initial estimates 
in those cases where we determine that the useful life of a long lived asset should be revised  we will depreciate the net book value in excess of the estimated residual value over its revised remaining useful life 
factors such as changes in the planned use of equipment  customer attrition  contractual amendments or mandated regulatory requirements could result in shortened useful lives 

table of contents long lived assets and asset groups are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
the estimated future cash flows are based upon  among other things  assumptions about expected future operating performance and estimated discount rates  and may differ from actual cash flows 
impairments will also be assessed when assets are determined to be held for sale  as opposed to held and used in operations 
reserve for excess and obsolete inventory inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market 
given the rapid change in technology  and volatility of the industries in which we serve  we monitor and forecast expected inventory needs based on our constantly changing sales forecast 
inventory is written down or written off when it becomes obsolete  generally because of engineering changes to a product or discontinuance of a product line  or when it is deemed excess 
these determinations involve the exercise of significant judgment by management  and as demonstrated in recent periods  demand for our products is volatile and changes in expectations regarding the level of future sales can result in substantial charges against earnings for excess and obsolete inventory 
for the years ended december   and  we recorded charges of million  million and million  respectively  for excess and obsolete inventory 
as of december   we had inventory balances of approximately million 
a significant decrease in the demand for our products  technological change  or new product development could result in charges for excess and obsolete inventory that are material to our financial condition and results of operations 
reserve for warranty we provide warranty coverage for our products  ranging from to months  with the majority of our products ranging from to months  and estimate the anticipated cost of repairing our products under such warranties based on the historical cost of the repairs and expected product failure rates 
the assumptions we use to estimate warranty accruals are reevaluated periodically in light of actual experience and  when appropriate  the accruals are adjusted 
our determination of the appropriate level of warranty accrual is subjective  and based on estimates 
the industries in which we operate are subject to rapid technological change 
as a result  we periodically introduce newer  more complex products  which tend to result in increased warranty costs 
we expect the industries in which we operate to continue to require the introduction of new technologies  which could cause our warranty costs to increase in the future 
should product failure rates differ from our estimates  actual costs could vary significantly from our expectations 
we recorded warranty charges of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
commitments and contingencies we are involved in disputes and legal actions arising in the normal course of our business 
while we currently believe that the amount of any ultimate potential loss would not be material to our financial position  the outcome of these actions is inherently difficult to predict 
in the event of an adverse outcome  the ultimate potential loss could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or reported results of operations in a particular quarter 
an unfavorable decision  particularly in patent litigation  could require material changes in production processes and products or result in our inability to ship products or components found to have violated third party patent rights 
we accrue loss contingencies in connection with our 
table of contents litigation when it is probable that a loss has occurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
revenue recognition we generally recognize revenue upon shipment of our products and spare parts  at which time title passes to the customer  as our shipping terms are fob shipping point  the price is fixed and collectability is reasonably assured 
generally  we do not have obligations to our customers after our products are shipped other than pursuant to warranty obligations 
in limited instances we provide installation of our products 
in accordance with emerging issues task force issue accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  we allocate revenue based on the fair value of the delivered item  generally the product  and the undelivered item  installation  based on their respective fair values 
revenue related to the undelivered item is deferred until the services have been completed 
in certain limited instances  some of our customers have negotiated product acceptance provisions relative to specific orders 
under these circumstances we defer revenue recognition until the related acceptance provisions have been satisfied 
revenue deferrals are reported as customer deposits and deferred revenue 
in certain instances  we require our customers to pay for a portion or all of their purchases prior to our building or shipping these products 
cash payments received prior to shipment are recorded as customer deposits and deferred revenue in the accompanying balance sheets  and then recognized as revenue upon shipment of the products 
we do not offer price protections to our customers or allow returns  unless covered by our normal policy for repair of defective products 
we may also deliver products to customers for evaluation purposes 
in these arrangements  the customer retains the products for specified periods of time without commitment to purchase 
on or before the expiration of the evaluation period  the customer either rejects the product and returns it to us  or accepts the product 
upon acceptance  title passes to the customer  we invoice the customer for the product  and revenue is recognized 
pending acceptance by the customer  such products are reported on our balance sheet at an estimated value based on the lower of cost or market  and are included in the amount for demonstration and customer service equipment  net of accumulated amortization 
stock based compensation in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards nos 
and  we have elected to continue to account for our employee stock based compensation plans using the intrinsic value method in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations  which do not require compensation expense to be recorded if the consideration to be received is at least equal to the fair value of the common stock to be received at the measurement date 
we provide information as to what our earnings and earnings per share would have been had we used the fair value method prescribed by sfas no 
in future periods the financial accounting standards board will likely require companies to expense the fair value of their stock 
table of contents based compensation over the respective vesting period 
such new accounting guidance is expected to have a material effect upon our results of operations 
deferred income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
sfas no 
requires deferred tax assets and liabilities to be recognized for temporary differences between the tax basis and financial reporting basis of assets and liabilities  computed at current tax rates  as well as for the expected tax benefit of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
during  we recorded valuation allowances against certain of our united states and foreign net deferred tax assets in jurisdictions where we have incurred significant losses in  and given such experience  management could not conclude that it was more likely than not that these net deferred tax assets would be realized 
while there are indications that the markets in which we operate may improve in and  these indications have not yet resulted in substantial taxable income 
accordingly  our management  in accordance with sfas no 
 in evaluating the recoverability of these net deferred tax assets  was required to place greater weight on our historical results as compared to projections regarding future taxable income 
if we generate future taxable income  or should we be able to conclude that sufficient taxable income is reasonably assured based on profitable operations  in the appropriate tax jurisdictions  against which these tax attributes may be applied  some portion or all of the valuation allowance will be reversed and a corresponding reduction in income tax expense will be reported in future periods 
a portion of the valuation allowance relates to the benefit from stock based compensation 
any reversal of valuation allowances from this item will be reflected as a component of stockholders equity 
when recording acquisitions  we have recorded valuation allowances due to the uncertainty related to the realization of certain deferred tax assets existing at the acquisition dates 
the amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable is subject to adjustment in future periods if estimates of future taxable income are changed 
any reversals of valuation allowances recorded in purchase accounting will be reflected as a reduction of goodwill in the period of reversal 
recent acquisitions on march   we completed the acquisition of dressler hf technik gmbh  or dressler  a privately owned stolberg  germany based provider of power supplies and matching networks 
we acquired dressler to expand our product offerings to customers in the semiconductor  data storage and flat panel equipment markets with dressler s power product portfolio that includes a wide range of power levels and radio frequencies 
in addition  with inroads already made into the laser and medical markets  dressler enables us to explore new market opportunities 
dressler also strengthens our presence in the european marketplace and has well established relationships with many european customers  who look to dressler for innovative technical capability  high quality products  and highly responsive customer service 

table of contents on january   we completed the acquisition of aera japan limited  or aera  a privately held japanese corporation 
aera supplies the semiconductor capital equipment industry with product lines that include digital mass flow controllers  thermal based mass flow controllers  pressure based mass flow controllers  liquid mass flow controllers and liquid vapor delivery systems 
aera provides us with a key leadership position in the gas delivery market 
in addition  aera s products expand our offering of critical subsystem solutions that enable the plasma based manufacturing processes used in the manufacture of semiconductors 
the results of operations of these acquired companies are included in our consolidated statements of operations as of and since the date of acquisition

however  we believe the industry is highly cyclical and is impacted by changes in the macroeconomic environment  changes in semiconductor supply and demand and rapid technological advances in both semiconductor devices and wafer fabrication processes 
rapid growth and expansion during was followed by the most pronounced slump in industry history  with year to year revenues falling approximately throughout the industry from to and declining nominally thereafter 
our sales over the last three years illustrate this cyclicality 
our sales to the semiconductor capital equipment industry declined by approximately from to  excluding the effect of the acquisitions of aera and dressler  and by approximately from to our sales to the data storage  flat panel display and advanced product applications markets  increased each year from through this growth is primarily attributed to market share gains  order trends and the general expansion of end customer products including large flat panel displays  liquid crystal displays  dvd applications and applications dependent upon industrial coatings 
looking forward to  our revenue may increase due to the recovery of the semiconductor capital equipment industry 
our other markets are also expected to grow 
table of contents in however  our average selling prices are likely to decline across all of our markets due to cost reduction initiatives by our major customers 
gross margin our gross margin was in  in and in our gross margin improved from to primarily due to our cost reduction measures  including our ongoing efforts to transition a portion of our manufacturing capacity to china and our supply base to tier asian suppliers  as well as improved absorption due to the higher sales base  however  the transition of a portion of our manufacturing capacity to china has required us to operate duplicative manufacturing facilities which during impacted our gross margin 
while we expect the transition of a portion of our production to china and our move to tier asian suppliers will improve our gross margins in future periods  factors that could cause our gross margins to be negatively impacted include  but are not limited to the following continued pricing pressure from our major customers  costs associated with transitioning a portion of our production to our new china facility  including costs incurred to operate duplicate manufacturing facilities  unanticipated costs to comply with our customers copy exact requirements  especially related to our china transition and move to tier asian suppliers  cost reduction programs initiated by semiconductor manufacturers and semiconductor capital equipment manufacturers that negatively impact our average selling price  warranty costs in excess of historical rates and our expectations  increased levels of excess and obsolete inventory  either due to market conditions  the introduction of new products by our competitors  or our decision to discontinue certain product lines  and changes in foreign currency exchange rates that might affect our costs 
we recognized charges for excess and obsolete inventory of approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
our warranty charges in  and were approximately million  million and million 
taken together  these charges represented approximately  and of sales during  and  respectively 
the major items affecting our gross margin in these years follow  and represent the most severe downturn in the semiconductor industry s history 
as a result  our sales declined significantly  which impacted our absorption of fixed costs 

table of contents the semiconductor industry is moving to mm wafers and smaller line widths 
typical of products early in their life cycle and at low production levels  these products have lower margins than our established products 
our cost of sales was adversely affected by periodic write downs of excess and obsolete inventory  particularly in the fourth quarter of when our management made a strategic decision to discontinue certain product offerings  which resulted in an increase in excess and obsolete inventory expense 
we incurred warranty expense in excess of both historical rates and our expectations related to certain products  which required substantial rework  repair  and in some cases  replacement 
the development of these products in and was accelerated to meet pressing customer needs in the midst of historically high product demand 
during and a significant portion of our warranty reserves were used to address these products 
the following summarizes the activity in our warranty reserve during and balance at additions balance at beginning of charged end of period to expense deductions period in thousands research and development the market for our subsystems for vacuum process systems and related accessories is characterized by ongoing technological changes 
we believe that continued and timely development of new products and enhancements to existing products to support oem requirements is necessary for us to maintain a competitive position in the markets we serve 
accordingly  we devote a significant portion of our personnel and financial resources to research and development projects and seek to maintain close relationships with our customers and other industry leaders in order to remain responsive to their product requirements 
we believe that the continued investment in research and development and ongoing development of new products are essential to the expansion of our markets  and expect to continue to make significant investments in research and development activities 
since our inception  all of our research and development costs have been expensed as incurred 
our research and development expenses were million in  million in and million in as a percentage of sales  research and development expenses decreased from in to in and in  due to the higher sales base 
the increase in research and development expenses from to was primarily due to increases in payroll and depreciation of equipment used for new product development 
the increase in research and development expenses from to was primarily due to the acquisitions of aera and dressler and expenditures to launch new products 
combined research and development expenses for 
table of contents aera and dressler were approximately million in we expect our research and development expenses  in dollar terms  to be in line with sales and marketing expenses due  in part  to our recent acquisitions  our sales and marketing efforts have become increasingly complex 
we continue to rationalize our sales and marketing functions with current industry conditions  while at the same time striving to increase market share and net sales 
we have continued the effort to market directly to end users of our products  in addition to our traditional marketing to manufacturers of plasma based equipment 
our sales and marketing expenses support domestic and international sales and marketing activities that include personnel  trade shows  advertising  and other selling and marketing activities 
sales and marketing expenses were million in  million in and million in the decrease in sales and marketing expenses from to was primarily due to the closing of certain sales and service locations 
see restructuring charges below for further discussion on these site closures 
as a percentage of sales  sales and marketing expenses decreased from in to in due to our cost reduction measures and the higher sales base 
sales and marketing expenses increased from of sales in to in primarily due to our acquisitions of aera and dressler in combined sales and marketing expenses for these companies were approximately million in we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in  due to our higher anticipated sales level 
general and administrative expenses our general and administrative expenses support our worldwide corporate  legal  patent  tax  financial  corporate governance  administrative  information systems and human resource functions in addition to our general management 
general and administrative expenses were million in  million in and million in the decrease in general and administrative expense from to was due to our ongoing cost reduction measures as discussed in restructuring charges 
as a percentage of sales  general and administrative expenses decreased from in to in due to our cost reduction measures and the higher sales base 
the increase in general and administrative expenses from to was primarily due to the absorption of additional headcount as a result of our acquisitions of aera and dressler  which contributed approximately million to our general and administrative expenses in as a percentage of sales  general and administrative expenses increased from in to in we expect our general and administrative expenses in to be in line with litigation damages and expenses recovery during  we received a million settlement for recovery of legal expenses pertaining to a patent infringement suit in which we were the plaintiff 

table of contents during  we recorded a charge of million pertaining to damages awarded by a jury in a patent infringement case in which we were the defendant  and legal expenses related to the judgment 
the applied science and technology  or astex  division of mks instruments  inc was the plaintiff in the case  which was tried in a delaware court 
sales of the product in question have accounted for less than five percent of our total sales each year since the product s introduction 
we have entered into a settlement agreement with mks allowing us to sell the infringing product to one of our customers subsequent to the date of the jury award 
under the settlement agreement  royalties payable to mks from sales of the infringing product were not material in during  litigation with mks recommenced involving claims that one of our new products infringed certain patents held by mks 
the current patent case has been set for trial in july and we anticipate significantly increased spending for legal and other trial related expenses in restructuring charges during  in response to the downturn in the semiconductor capital equipment industry  we implemented several reductions in force totaling regular employees and temporary employees and closed our manufacturing facilities in austin  texas and san jose  california 
total restructuring charges for were approximately million 
we recorded restructuring charges totaling million in  primarily associated with changes in operations designed to reduce redundancies and better align aera s mass flow controller business within its operating framework 
our restructuring plans and associated costs consisted of million to close and consolidate certain manufacturing facilities  and million for related headcount reductions of approximately employees 
at the end of  we announced major changes in our operations to occur through these included establishing a manufacturing location in china  consolidating worldwide sales forces  a move to tier suppliers  primarily in asia  and the intention to close or sell certain facilities 
associated with the above plan  we recognized restructuring charges of approximately million during these charges consisted of the recognition of expense for involuntary employee termination benefits for employees in our united states operations and voluntary employee termination benefits  primarily in our japanese operations for employees  and asset impairments incurred as a result of closing our longmont  co manufacturing facilities 

table of contents goodwill and other intangible asset impairments during  we determined that one of our mass flow controller products would not conform to changing customer requirements  and as such would no longer be accepted by our customers 
as a result  we performed an assessment of the carrying value of the related intangible asset 
this assessment consisted of estimating the intangible asset s fair value and comparing the estimated fair value to the carrying value of the asset 
we estimated the intangible asset s fair value by applying a hypothetical royalty rate to the projected revenue stream and using a cash flow model discounted at discount rates consistent with the risk of the related cash flows 
based on this analysis we determined that the fair value of the intangible asset was minimal and recorded an impairment of the carrying value of approximately million 
sales of this product represented less than of our total sales during  and during  we made periodic advances and investments totaling approximately million to symphony systems  inc in  symphony s financial situation began to deteriorate significantly  and we determined that due to symphony s need for immediate liquidity  its declining business prospects  including the indefinite postponement of a significant order for its products from a major semiconductor capital equipment manufacturer  the value of our investment in and advances to symphony had substantially declined 
we valued our investments in and advances to symphony at december   at approximately million  which reflected our assessment of the value of the symphony technology license  which we believed had continuing value to us 
the amount of the impairment related to symphony was million 
symphony effectively ceased operations in february we hired symphony s key employees  and acquired symphony s remaining assets in a foreclosure and liquidation sale of such assets in april we recorded the assets acquired at their estimated fair values 
the excess purchase price over the estimated fair value of tangible assets acquired of approximately million was allocated to amortizable intangibles  with a weighted average estimated useful life of approximately years 
in the fourth quarter of  our sales to the semiconductor capital equipment industry declined substantially from the third quarter of as a result we evaluated the carrying amount of assets acquired from symphony by comparing its estimated future cash flows to its carrying value 
this analysis indicated that our investment was impaired and we recorded an intangible impairment charge of million  which was the remaining book value of symphony s intangible assets 
during we terminated the operations of our tower electronics  inc subsidiary and our fourth state technology  or fst  product line due to significant softening in the projected demand for these products 
revenue contributed by tower and fst operations for represented less than five percent of our total revenue 
as a result of these actions  estimated related future cash flows no longer supported the carrying amounts of related goodwill  and we recorded goodwill impairment charges of million in related to tower and fst 

table of contents other income expense other income expense consists primarily of interest income and expense  foreign exchange gains and losses and other miscellaneous gains  losses  income and expense items 
interest income was approximately million in  million in and million in the decline in interest income from to was due to our lower level of investment in marketable securities and the overall lower rate of interest paid on our investments which resulted from the federal reserve lowering interest rates during the period 
the prime rate declined by from january to december additionally  during we used approximately million of cash and marketable securities to fund our operations 
our interest income in was lower than in due to our use of cash and marketable securities to finance the acquisitions of aera in january and dressler in march  and to repurchase a portion of our and convertible subordinated notes in the open market in the fourth quarter of interest income also declined throughout and due to the federal reserve lowering interest rates during the period 
the prime rate declined from in january to in december interest expense consists principally of interest on our convertible subordinated notes  amortization of our deferred offering costs on these notes  and bank loans and capital leases assumed in the acquisition of aera 
interest expense was approximately million in  million in and million in interest expense decreased from to due to the repurchase of approximately million and million of our and convertible subordinated notes in the fourth quarter of and due to the repayment of approximately million of notes payable and capital lease obligations during the increase in interest expense from to was primarily due to the issuance of our convertible subordinated notes in august and debt and capital leases assumed in the acquisition of aera in january our foreign subsidiaries sales are primarily denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
we recorded net foreign currency gains of  in  million in and a loss of  in our foreign currency gain in was primarily related to an intercompany loan of japanese yen  which was settled in january  that we made to our wholly owned subsidiary advanced energy japan kk  or ae japan  which has a functional currency of yen  for the purpose of effecting the acquisition of aera 
the loan was transacted in the first quarter of  for approximately billion yen  approximately million based upon an exchange rate of during the first half of that year  the us dollar weakened significantly against the yen to approximately  resulting in a gain of 
table of contents million 
in july and september  we entered into various foreign currency forward contracts with our primary banks to mitigate the effects of potential future currency fluctuations between the dollar and the yen until the associated intercompany obligations were settled 
in the fourth quarter of  we repurchased approximately million of our convertible subordinated notes and million of our convertible subordinated notes in the open market at an aggregate cost of approximately million 
these purchases resulted in a gain of million 
in prior financial statements this gain was reflected as an extraordinary item 
in april the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
on january  the adoption of this statement required us to reclassify our pretax extraordinary gain of million recorded during to other expense income in these financial statements 
miscellaneous expense items were  in  million in and million in miscellaneous expense in and was primarily related to the impairment of a marketable equity security 
during the fourth quarter of  the fair value of this security continued a substantial decline  and we determined the decline was other than temporary as defined by the financial accounting standards board 
as a result we recorded an impairment charge of approximately million 
in the first quarter of  this security continued to decline in value  and we recorded an additional impairment charge of  since the first quarter of  the value of this security has appreciated from million to million at december  however the increase in the fair value of this security will not be reflected in income until the security is sold

while there are indications that the markets in which we operate may improve in and  we have not yet been able to generate significant taxable income in the jurisdictions in which we operate 
accordingly  our management  in accordance with sfas no 
 in evaluating the recoverability of these net deferred tax assets  was required to place greater 
table of contents weight on our historical results as compared to projections regarding future taxable income 
due to the valuation allowances we recorded in  we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately to  subject to variations in the relative earnings or losses in the tax jurisdictions in which we have operations 
if we generate future taxable income  or should we be able to conclude that sufficient taxable income is reasonably assured based on profitable operations  in the appropriate tax jurisdictions  against which these tax attributes may be applied  some portion or all of the valuation allowance will be reversed and a corresponding reduction in income tax expense will be reported in future periods 
a portion of the valuation allowance relates to the benefit from stock based compensation 
any reversal of valuation allowance from this item will be reflected as a component of stockholders equity 
the income tax provision of million for represented a negative effective tax rate of 
the income tax benefit of million for represented an effective tax rate of 
the income tax benefit of million for represented an effective rate of 
when recording acquisitions  we have recorded valuation allowances due to the uncertainty related to the realization of certain deferred tax assets existing at the acquisition dates 
the amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable is subject to adjustment in future periods if estimates of future taxable income are changed 
reversals of valuation allowances recorded in purchase accounting will be reflected as a reduction of goodwill in the period of reversal 
quarterly results of operations the following tables present unaudited quarterly results in dollars and as a percentage of sales for each of the eight quarters in the period ended december  we believe that all necessary adjustments have been included in the amounts stated below to present fairly such quarterly information

table of contents due to the cyclical nature of the semiconductor capital equipment industry as well as the other industries in which our customers operate  and the sudden changes resulting in severe downturns and upturns  we have experienced and expect to continue to experience significant fluctuations in our quarterly operating results 
our levels of operating expenditures are based  in part  on expectations of future revenues that such expenses support 
if revenue levels in a particular quarter do not meet expectations  operating results may be adversely affected 
our quarterly operating results in and reflect the fluctuating demand for our products during this period  principally from manufacturers of semiconductor capital equipment  data storage equipment and flat panel displays  and our ability to adjust our manufacturing capacity and infrastructure to meet this demand 
additionally our average selling prices across all markets declined approximately during sales to the semiconductor capital equipment industry increased in the second quarter of from the prior quarter  then declined in the third quarter of from the second quarter of  and a further in the fourth quarter of from the third quarter of  due to the market conditions discussed above 
in the first quarter of sales to the semiconductor capital equipment industry decreased another 
in the second  third and fourth quarters  sales to this industry increased  and  respectively  quarter over quarter 
data storage sales fluctuated significantly throughout flat panel sales increased substantially in the third and fourth quarters of due to seasonal fluctuations 
data storage sales increased by  and during the first  second and third quarters of in the fourth quarter of  data storage sales declined 
the improvement in data storage sales through the third quarter of  was primarily caused by the growth of dvd applications which are demanding more capacity  density and refined power 
the decline in the fourth quarter of was due to the seasonal demand for end consumer products 
flat panel sales declined by and in the first and second quarters of  then increased by and in the third and fourth quarters of the volatility of the flat panel market was partially caused by seasonal factors and the increased demand for products utilizing this technology as well as the increasing size and resolution of displays associated with consumer electronic products 
our revenue from all sectors is heavily influenced by general economic conditions and consumer spending patterns in each of the industries we serve 
as a result of the semiconductor capital equipment industry slowdown which started in  we periodically evaluated our reserves for excess and obsolete inventory and income tax valuation allowances  as well as assessed the carrying value of our long lived assets 
as a result of these periodic assessments  our management deemed increased amounts of our inventory to be excess or obsolete particularly in the fourth quarter of  certain intangible assets fair values did not support their carrying value in the fourth quarter of and third quarter of  warranty costs associated with certain products were in excess of historical experience and our expectations which also 
table of contents adversely affected margins  particularly in the fourth quarter of  and in the third quarter of  due to our continued losses  we recorded a significant valuation allowance against certain of our united states and foreign net deferred tax assets 
in  gross margins improved each quarter through the third quarter  primarily due to better absorption from our increasing sales base 
in the fourth quarter of  our gross margin declined substantially as the sudden decline of in our sales base hampered our fixed cost absorption and caused us to adjust our excess and obsolete inventory reserves to reflect our revised sales outlook 
during  as we began the implementation of our china based manufacturing facility and transition of a portion of our supply base to tier asian suppliers  our gross margin was negatively affected due to the costs of running duplicative facilities and new supplier qualification efforts 
off balance sheet arrangements the following table sets forth our significant off balance sheet arrangements  long term debt and capital lease obligations as of december  payments due by period in thousands contractual obligations thereafter total convertible subordinated notes senior borrowings capital lease obligations operating lease obligations inventory purchase obligations total obligations please refer to footnote notes payable  footnote convertible subordinated notes payable  footnote commitments and contingencies and footnote related party transactions included in part ii  item of this form k for further discussion regarding our significant off balance sheet arrangements  long term debt and capital lease obligations 
our inventory purchase obligations consist of minimum purchase commitments we entered into with various suppliers to ensure we have an adequate supply of critical components to meet the demand of our customers 
we believe that these purchase commitments will be consumed in our on going operations during we have also committed to advance up to million to a privately held company in exchange for an exclusive intellectual property license 
at december   approximately  has been advanced under this agreement and expensed as research and development costs 
the amount and 
table of contents timing of this advance is dependent upon the privately held company achieving certain business development milestones 
liquidity and capital resources at december   our principle sources of liquidity consisted of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million  and a credit facility consisting of a million revolving line of credit  none of which was outstanding at december  advances under the revolving line of credit would bear interest at the prime rate at february  minus 
any advances under this revolving line of credit will be due and payable in may we are subject to covenants on our line of credit that provide certain restrictions related to working capital  net worth  acquisitions and payment and declaration of dividends 
we were in compliance with all such covenants at december  during  our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities decreased million from million at december  in  when our convertible subordinated notes become due  it is possible we may need substantial funds to repay such debt  which totaled million at december  our convertible subordinated notes with a principal balance of million are due september   and our convertible subordinated notes with a principal balance of million are due november  payment would be required if our common stock price remains below approximately per share for the convertible subordinated notes and approximately per share for the convertible subordinated notes 
in such a situation  there can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance the debt 
to address our liquidity requirements  we have set a goal to move to a more variable operating model where we will reduce our operating cash flow breakeven point 
additionally  we may raise capital through the public markets during by issuing common stock or convertible debt securities  or a combination of the two 
such proceeds will be used to realign our capital structure and provide liquidity for the next semiconductor capital equipment up cycle 
however  we cannot provide assurance that such sources of liquidity will be available to us on acceptable terms 
we have historically financed our operations and capital requirements through a combination of cash provided by operations  the issuance of long term debt and common stock  bank loans  capital lease obligations and operating leases 
however  we have not generated positive cash flow from operations since operating activities used cash of million in  reflecting our net loss of million partially offset by non cash items of million and increased by net working capital changes of approximately million 
non cash items primarily consisted of the following 
table of contents depreciation of property and equipment of million 
we expect depreciation expense to increase to a range of million to million in this increase is primarily due to capital expenditures incurred in to launch our china based manufacturing facility and information technology systems expenditures in and  amortization of intangible assets and demonstration and customer service equipment of million  amortization of deferred debt issuance costs of million  provision for excess and obsolete inventory of million  provision for deferred income taxes of million 
in  we recorded valuation allowances against certain of our united states and foreign deferred income tax assets 
we may generate taxable income in  enabling us to reverse a portion of our valuation allowance 
this reversal would create a use of cash from operations as the benefit from deferred income taxes is a non cash item  a loss on the disposal of property and equipment of million 
during  we closed multiple facilities resulting in the disposal of certain property and equipment 
we plan to close our voorhees  new jersey manufacturing facility in the first half of such closure may result in additional capital equipment disposals  if the related equipment cannot be utilized elsewhere in our organization  and intangible asset impairment of million 
in the third quarter of  the fair value of one of our intangible assets did not support its carrying value and an impairment loss was recognized 
based on our forecasts  we do not expect to incur additional intangible asset impairments in however  our forecast is subject to numerous factors that are beyond our control  therefore we can provide no assurance regarding the future recoverability of our intangible assets 
net working capital changes used cash of million and primarily consisted of the following collection of million of net income tax receivables during  an increase in accounts receivable of million 
we expect our accounts receivable to remain high during if industry conditions continue to improve  an million increase in inventory 
due to the establishment of our china based manufacturing facility and increased sales orders we have built our inventory level to mitigate the risk of not being able to meet increasing customer demand for our products  a million increase in trade accounts payable  which was primarily incurred to finance our inventory purchases  a million increase in customer deposits and other accrued expenses  a million decrease in accrued warranty  and a million decrease in accrued restructuring 
operating activities used cash of million in  reflecting our net loss of million partially offset by non cash items of million and net working capital 
table of contents changes of approximately million 
non cash items primarily consisted of the following a million pretax gain on the retirement of a portion of our convertible notes  repurchased at a discount below face value  a million gain on an intercompany foreign currency loan 
we do not expect to realize significant gains from intercompany indebtedness in the future as a result of a change in our currency risk management policy  a million benefit for deferred income taxes  depreciation of property and equipment of million  amortization of intangible assets and demonstration and customer service equipment of million  provision for excess and obsolete inventory of million  provision for doubtful accounts of million  and impairments of million consisting of intangible assets of million  property and equipment of million and marketable securities of million 
net working capital changes provided cash of million and primarily consisted of the following a million increase in accounts receivable  a million increase in demonstration and customer service equipment  a million increase in accrued warranty costs  and a million increase in accrued restructuring charges 
operating activities generated cash of million in  reflecting our net loss of million adjusted for non cash items of million and changes in working capital of million 
non cash items primarily consisted of the following a million benefit for deferred income taxes  depreciation of property and equipment of million  amortization of intangible assets and demonstration equipment of million  a provision for excess and obsolete inventory of million  and impairments of million 
our impairments consisted of goodwill of million and an investment of million 
net working capital changes provided cash of million and primarily consisted of a million decrease in accounts receivable  a million increase in inventory  a million decrease in accounts payable  a million decrease in accrued payroll and employee benefits  and a million increase in net income taxes receivable 

table of contents our near term future operating activities may continue to use cash 
periods of rapidly increasing sales may cause increased working capital requirements  thereby requiring the use of cash to fund our operations 
investing activities used cash of million in and primarily consisted of the purchase of equipment for million and the settlement of the escrow deposit liability related to our acquisition of dressler in of million  partially offset by proceeds from the sale of assets of million and the net sale of marketable securities of million 
we expect to spend between million and million for the purchase of property and equipment in our planned level of capital expenditures is subject to frequent revisions because our business experiences sudden changes as we move into industry upturns and downturns and expected sales levels change 
in addition  changes in foreign currency exchange rates may significantly impact our capital expenditures and depreciation expense recognized in a particular period 
investing activities provided cash of million in and consisted of cash generated by the net sale of marketable securities of million  partially offset by cash used for the acquisition of aera for million net of million of cash acquired  the acquisition of dressler for million net of  of cash acquired  the acquisition of the minority interest of litmas for  in addition to our common stock valued at approximately million  the purchase of property and equipment of million and the purchase of other investments of million 
although investing activities provided cash of million in  our total cash and marketable securities declined approximately million during our marketable securities are not considered cash equivalents  and a significant portion of these securities were sold during  to finance the above transactions as well as to fund our operating activities 
investing activities used cash of million in  and consisted of the acquisition of emco for million net of  of cash acquired  the net purchase of marketable securities of million  the purchase of investments and advances of million and the purchase of property and equipment of million 
investing cash flows experience significant fluctuations from year to year as we buy and sell marketable securities  which we convert to cash to fund strategic investments and our operating cash flow  and as we transfer cash into marketable securities when we attain levels of cash that are greater than needed for current operations 
however  we do not expect to generate significant levels of cash that are greater than needed for our current operations in the near term 
financing activities used cash of million in  and consisted of payments on our senior borrowings and capital lease obligations of million  partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and sale of common stock through our employee stock purchase plan  or espp of million 
we expect our financing activities to continue to fluctuate in the future 
if market 
table of contents conditions and our financial position are deemed appropriate  we may repurchase additional convertible notes in the open market 
our payments under capital lease obligations and notes payable may also increase in the future if we enter into additional capital lease obligations or change the level of our bank financing 
our estimated payments under capital lease obligations and bank debt during will be approximately million 
however  a significant portion of these obligations are held in countries other than the united states  therefore  future foreign currency fluctuations  especially between the dollar and the yen  could cause significant fluctuations in our estimated payment obligations 
financing activities used cash of million in  and consisted primarily of open market repurchases of our convertible notes of million  the repayment of our senior borrowings and capital lease obligations of million  partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and sale of common stock through our espp of million 
financing activities provided cash of million in  and consisted primarily of proceeds from convertible debt of million and proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and sale of common stock through our espp of million 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and long term debt obligations 
we generally place our investments with high credit quality issuers and by policy are averse to principal loss and seek to protect and preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
as of december   our investments in marketable securities consisted primarily of commercial paper  municipal and state bonds and notes and institutional money markets 
these securities are highly liquid 
earnings on our marketable securities are typically invested into similar securities 
in  the rates we earned on our marketable securities approximated on a before tax equivalent basis 
because the federal reserve repeatedly lowered interest rates throughout  and  the interest rates we earned on our investments likewise decreased substantially 
this  in conjunction with using our available cash and cash reserves to fund our operations and for acquisitions  including the emco acquisition in january  the aera acquisition in january  the dressler acquisition in march  and the repurchase of a portion of our convertible subordinated notes in the fourth quarter of  has greatly reduced our recent and anticipated interest income 
the impact on interest income of a decrease in the average interest rate would have resulted in approximately  less interest income in   in and  in the interest rates on our subordinated debt are fixed  specifically  at for the million of our debt due november  and at for the million of our 
table of contents debt that is due september our offerings of subordinated debt in and increased our fixed interest expense upon each issuance  though interest expense was partially reduced by the repurchase of a portion of these offerings 
because these rates are fixed  we believe there is no risk of increased interest expense with regard to these instruments 
the interest rates on our aera japan subsidiary s credit lines are variable and currently range from to 
we believe a increase in the average interest rate on these instruments would not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we transact business in various foreign countries 
our primary foreign currency cash flows are generated in countries in asia and europe 
during  the us dollar weakened approximately against the japanese yen and against the euro 
it is highly uncertain how currency exchange rates will fluctuate in the future 
we have entered into various foreign currency forward exchange contracts to mitigate against currency fluctuations in the japanese yen  euro  taiwanese dollar and chinese yuan 
the notional amount of our foreign currency contracts at december  was million 
the potential fair value loss for a hypothetical adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates at december   would be approximately million  which would be essentially offset by corresponding gains related to the underlying assets 
we will continue to evaluate various methods to minimize the effects of currency fluctuations when we translate the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries into us dollars 
at december  we held foreign currency forward exchange contracts  maturing through march  to purchase us dollars and sell various foreign currencies 
the following table summarizes our outstanding contracts as of december  market settlement unrealized notional amounts amounts loss gain japanese yen contracts euro contract taiwanese dollar contract chinese yuan contract balance at december
