critical accounting policies the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements requires management of the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts 
the estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an on going basis and are based on historical experience and on various other factors that management believes to be reasonable 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies describe the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements inventory 
the company s merchandise inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on a weighted average cost method 
the company purchases manufacturer overruns and canceled orders both during and at the end of a season which are referred to as packaway inventory 
packaway inventory is purchased with the intent that it will be stored in the company s warehouses until a later date  which may even be the beginning of the same selling season in the following year 
included in the carrying value of the company s inventory is a provision for shrinkage 
the shrinkage reserve is based on historical shrinkage rates as evaluated through the company s physical inventory counts and cycle counts 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  or if sales of the inventory are more difficult than anticipated  additional inventory write downs may be required 
long lived assets 
the company records a long lived asset impairment charge when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long lived asset may not be recoverable based on estimated future cash flows 
an impairment loss would be recognized if analysis of the undiscounted cash flow of an asset group was less than the carrying value of the asset group 
in the course of performing this analysis  management determined that no long lived asset impairment charge was required for years ended january   february  and february  should actual results differ materially from projected results  an impairment charge may be required in the future 
self insurance 
the company self insures certain of its workers compensation and general liability risks as well as certain of its health insurance plans 
the company s self insurance liability is determined actuarially  based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported 
should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what is estimated or the costs of medical care and state statutory requirements increase beyond what was anticipated  reserves recorded may not be sufficient and additional charges could be required 
the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of the company s accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
see the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto  which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles 
forward looking statements and factors affecting future performance this report includes certain forward looking statements  which reflect the company s current beliefs and estimates with respect to future events and the company s future financial performance  operations and competitive position 
the words expect  anticipate  estimate  believe  looking ahead  forecast  plan  projected  and similar expressions identify forward looking statements 
the company s continued success depends  in part  upon its ability to increase sales at existing locations  to open new stores and to operate stores on a profitable basis 
there can be no assurance that the company s existing strategies and store expansion program will result in a continuation of revenue and profit growth 
future economic and industry trends that could potentially impact revenue and profitability remain difficult to predict 
the forward looking statements that are contained in this report are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the company s actual results to differ materially from historical results or current expectations 
these risk factors apply to both ross and dd s discounts sm stores and include  without limitation  a general deterioration in economic trends  changes in geopolitical conditions  ongoing competitive pressures in the apparel industry  the company s ability to obtain acceptable store locations  the company s ability to continue to purchase attractive brand name merchandise at desirable discounts  the company s ability to operate its distribution network at targeted levels of productivity  the company s ability to successfully extend its geographic reach into new markets  unseasonable weather trends  changes in the level of consumer spending on or preferences in apparel or home related merchandise  the company s ability to attract and retain personnel with the retail talent necessary to execute its strategies  the company s ability to implement and integrate various new systems and technologies  and greater than planned costs 
in addition  the company is evaluating whether it will incur a potential non cash  non recurring charge to write down the value of the company s newark headquarters and distribution center to current fair market value 
additionally  the anticipated relaxation of trade restrictions with china in january may affect the company s buying strategies and price points 
in addition  the company s corporate headquarters  certain of its distribution centers and of its stores are located in california 
therefore  a downturn in the california economy or a major california natural disaster could significantly affect the company s operating results and financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risks  which primarily include changes in interest rates 
the company does not engage in financial transactions for trading or speculative purposes 
interest that is payable on the company s revolving credit facilities and long term debt is based on variable interest rates and is  therefore  affected by changes in market interest rates 
in addition  lease payments under certain of the company s synthetic lease agreements are determined based on variable interest rates and are  therefore  affected by changes in market interest rates 
as of january   the company had no borrowings outstanding under its revolving credit facilities and had million of long term debt outstanding which accrues interest at libor plus basis points 
a hypothetical basis point increase in prevailing market interest rates would not have materially impacted the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows as of and for the year ended january  the company does not consider the potential losses in future earnings and cash flows from reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates to be material 
the company does not currently use derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio
