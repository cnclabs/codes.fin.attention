table of contents protection products segment products our protection products segment consists of individual fixed life insurance premiums from traditional life insurance products  universal life insurance products and equity indexed life insurance products 
sales are presented as annualized premiums  which are measured in accordance with industry practice  and represent the amount of new business sold during the period 
sales are a non gaap financial measure for an insurance company for which there is no comparable gaap financial measure 
we use sales to measure the productivity of our distribution network and as a basis for compensation of sales and marketing employees and agents 
sales are also a leading indicator of future revenue trends 
however  revenues are driven by prior period sales as well as current period sales and therefore  a reconciliation of sales to revenues would not be meaningful or determinable 
the following table summarizes sales by life insurance product sales activity by product for the years ended december  in thousands traditional life insurance whole life interest sensitive whole life term life universal life equity indexed life direct private label term life premiums total traditional life insurance products 
traditional life insurance products include whole life  interest sensitive whole life and term life insurance products 
whole life insurance is designed to provide benefits for the life of the insured 
this product generally provides for level premiums and a level death benefit and requires payments in excess of the mortality cost in earlier years to offset increasing mortality costs in later years 
sales of whole life insurance decreased in and  as compared to each prior year  due in part to our increased marketing focus on equity indexed life products  which has resulted in a shift in sales from whole life to equity indexed 
we ceased taking new applications for sales of whole life insurance on december  interest sensitive whole life insurance also provides benefits for the life of the insured 
however  this product has cash value accumulation that is interest sensitive and responds to current interest and mortality rates 
these products are used in several markets  the largest of which is the pension plan market 
lower interest sensitive whole life sales were experienced in due to uncertainty in government tax policy and regulation 
interest sensitive whole life insurance sales increased in due to the acquisition of ilico in may since we owned ilico for months of as compared to just over six months in term life insurance provides life insurance protection for a specific time period which generally can be renewed at an increased premium 
such policies are mortality based and offer no cash accumulation feature 
term life insurance is a highly competitive and quickly changing market 
term life insurance sales increased in due to the acquisition of ilico and have remained approximately of our total sales in in prior years  ilic had distributed term products primarily through strategic alliances with private label partners 
under private label arrangements  ilic manufactured products that were distributed through field forces of other life insurance companies  its private label partners 
following a strategic decision to exit the private label business  ilic reached agreement with its joint venture partners to cease new business 
table of contents processing during in keeping with contractual obligations  ilic continues to service in force business for existing joint venture partners 
for the year ended december   sales of interest sensitive whole life and term life insurance products represented and  respectively  of direct sales for individual life insurance products sold 
universal life insurance products 
we offer universal life insurance products  which provide flexible benefits for the insured 
within product limits and state regulations  policyowners may vary the amount and timing of premiums and the amount of the death benefit of their policies and keep the policies in force  as long as there are sufficient policy funds available to cover all policy charges for the next coverage period 
premiums  net of specified expenses  are credited to the policy  as is interest  generally at a rate determined from time to time by us 
specific charges are made against the policy for the cost of insurance and for expenses 
we invest the premiums we receive from the sale of universal life insurance products in our investment portfolio 
our gross margin from these products is the yield we earn on our investment portfolio plus the internal product charges less interest credited to policies and less mortality and other expenses 
sales of universal life were comparable between and in  sales increased over primarily as a result of the acquisition of ilico 
excluding ilico  universal life sales decreased million in due to the growth in sales of equity indexed life products 
the weighted average crediting rate for universal life insurance liabilities was for the year  for the year and for the year the crediting rate has been lowered as a result of reduced investment yields associated with the declining interest rate environment 
for the year ended december   sales of universal life insurance products represented of direct sales for individual life insurance products sold 
equity indexed life products 
we also offer equity indexed life insurance products which are similar in structure to universal life products but allow the policyowner to elect an interest earnings strategy for a portion of the account value 
earnings are credited based in part on increases in the appropriate indices  primarily the standard poor s composite stock index collectively  s p index  excluding dividends 
the earnings credit is subject to a participation rate and an annual cap 
our gross margin on our equity indexed life products is similar to that of our universal life insurance products 
however  due to the equity indexed earnings strategies  we invest a portion of the premiums we receive from the sale of these products in call options 
we may affect the cost of the call options by adjusting interest crediting parameters that are provided for in the policy 
our return on the call options is generally expected  in a growing equity market  to correspond to the earnings we are contractually bound to credit on the equity indexed strategies 
the remainder of the premium is invested in our investment portfolio to support the contractual minimum guarantees that may come into effect if the equity index declines 
the structure of our product  together with the allocation of our equity indexed life product premiums between call options and our investment portfolio  are intended to provide for a positive gross margin in both increasing and decreasing equity markets 
equity indexed life insurance sales increased in and following our focus on product marketing beginning in we are a leading writer of equity indexed life products in the united states 
sales of the equity indexed life product  as a percentage of direct sales  was approximately in 
table of contents collected premiums are measured in accordance with industry practice  and represent the amount of premiums received during the period 
collected premiums are a non gaap financial measure for an insurance company for which there is no comparable gaap financial measure 
we use collected premiums to measure the productivity of our distribution network and as a basis for compensation of sales and marketing employees and agents

following a strategic decision to exit the private label business  ilic reached agreement with its joint venture partners to cease new business processing during in keeping with contractual obligations  ilic continues to service in force business for certain existing joint venture partners 
alic has reinsurance arrangements that have reduced its retention to of the net amount of risk on any one policy not to exceed company retention limits for the majority of policies issued from july  through december   and for all new business commencing january  alic s retention limits on any one life vary by age and rating table and are generally between  and  alic also has a reinsurance agreement covering approximately of the closed block net amount at risk not previously reinsured 
in addition  alic entered into an indemnity reinsurance agreement effective december  covering universal life policies of the open block issued prior to july   that was subsequently replaced by another indemnity reinsurance agreement effective october   covering of the net amount at risk not previously reinsured of any one policy

the states with the highest geographic concentration of sales  based on statutory premiums  are california  illinois  iowa  minnesota  new york  texas and wisconsin in these states account for approximately of our statutory premiums 
our target customers are individuals in the middle and upper income brackets and small businesses 
we market our life insurance products on a national basis primarily through a preferred producer general agency system  a personal producing general agent ppga distribution system and through independent marketing organizations imos 
we currently employ regional vice presidents who are responsible for supervising these distribution systems within their assigned geographic regions 
under the preferred producer general agency system  a contractual arrangement is entered into with the preferred producer general agent for the sale of insurance products by the preferred producer general agents and brokers assigned to the preferred producer general agent s agency 
the preferred producer general agents are primarily compensated by receiving a percentage of the first year commissions paid to preferred producer general agents and brokers in the preferred producer general agent s agency and by renewal commissions on 
table of contents premiums subsequently collected on that business 
in addition  the preferred producers receive certain benefits and other allowances 
the preferred producer general agents are independent contractors and are generally responsible for the expenses of operating their agencies  including office and overhead expenses and the recruiting  selection  contracting  training and development of preferred producer general agents and brokers in their agency 
as of december   we had preferred producer general agents in states  through which approximately  preferred producer general agents sell our products 
while preferred producer general agents in the preferred producer general agency system are non exclusive  most agents use our products for a majority of their new business for the type of products offered by us 
preferred producer general agents are also independent contractors and are primarily compensated by commissions on first year and renewal premiums collected on business written by them plus certain benefits and other allowances 
in addition  preferred producer general agents can earn bonus commissions  graded by production and persistency on their business 
under the ppga system  we contract primarily with individuals who are experienced individual agents or who head a small group of experienced individual agents 
these individuals are independent contractors and are responsible for all of their own expenses 
these individuals often sell products for other insurance companies  and may offer selected products we offer rather than our full line of insurance products 
the ppga system is comprised of approximately  ppgas  with approximately  agents 
ppgas are compensated by commissions on first year and renewal premiums collected on business written by themselves and the agents in their units 
in addition to a base commission  ppgas may earn bonus commissions on their business  graded by production and persistency 
we have also developed programs to sell life insurance through select imos 
the customers targeted and the products sold are similar to those of the preferred producer agency system and the ppga system 
under the imo system  a contractual arrangement is entered into with an imo to promote our insurance products to their network of agents and brokers 
the imo receives a commission and override commission on the business produced 
we currently have approximately imos under contract 
no single distribution organization preferred producer general agency  ppga  or imo accounted for more than of total direct sales 
accumulation products segment products our accumulation products segment primary offerings consist of individual fixed annuities comprised of traditional fixed annuities and equity indexed annuities and funding agreements 
annuities provide for the payment of periodic benefits over a specified time period 
benefits may commence immediately or may be deferred to a future date 
fixed annuities generally are backed by a general investment account and credited with a rate of return that is periodically reset 
funding agreements are arrangements for which we receive deposit funds and for which we agree to repay the deposit and a contractual return for the duration of the contract 
deposits are presented as collected premiums  which are measured in accordance with industry practice  and represent the amount of new business sold during the period 
deposits are a non gaap financial measure for an insurance company for which there is no comparable gaap financial measure 
we use deposits to measure the productivity of our distribution network and as a basis for compensation of sales and marketing employees and agents 
our annuity deposits consisted of approximately from traditional annuity products and approximately from equity indexed annuity products in we ceased offering variable annuity products in we still receive minimal premium additions to existing policies as shown in the table below 

table of contents funding agreement deposits totaled million in the following table sets forth deposits for the periods indicated deposits by product for the years ended december  in thousands annuities deferred fixed annuities traditional annuities equity indexed annuities variable annuities total annuities funding agreements total reinsurance assumed reinsurance ceded total deposits  net of reinsurance traditional annuity products 
we offer a variety of interest rate crediting strategies on our traditional annuity products 
at december   the account value of traditional annuities totaled billion of which approximately have minimum guarantee rates ranging from to 
for annuities with an account value of billion  the credited rate was equal to the minimum guarantee rate  and as a result  the credited rate cannot be lowered 
we also offer an interest rate crediting strategy that credits the policy with a return generally based upon the interest rates it earns on assets supporting the respective policies less management fees 
traditional annuities with an account value of billion had a one year interest guarantee period while annuities with an account value of billion had a multi year guarantee for which the credited rate cannot be decreased until the end of the multi year period 
at the end of the multi year period  we will have the ability to lower the crediting rate to the minimum guaranteed rate by an average of approximately basis points 
the remaining multi year period is generally either one or two years 
we invest the deposits we receive from traditional annuity product sales in our investment portfolio 
we call the difference between the yield we earn on our investment portfolio and the interest we credit on our traditional annuities our product spread 
the product spread is a major driver of our profitability of our traditional annuity products 
traditional annuity deposits decreased million in compared to as we slowed traditional annuity sales due to the low interest rate environment and as we have focused on sales of higher margin equity indexed products 
traditional annuity deposits decreased million in compared to as a result of deploying capital to funding agreements which are intended to provide a higher return on equity 
we previously had a reinsurance agreement to cede of certain fixed annuity production on a modified coinsurance basis 
fixed annuity production ceded under this agreement totaled approximately million in in the fourth quarter of  the agreement was cancelled and the previously ceded premiums were recaptured amounting to million 
equity indexed annuities 
we offer equity indexed annuity products that provide various interest crediting strategies  including strategies linked to equity and investment grade bond indices 
for deposits allocated to indexed crediting strategies  interest is credited to these products based in part on the increases in the applicable indices  less any applicable fees and subject to any applicable caps 
similar to our traditional annuity products  we invest the deposits we receive from equity indexed annuity product sales in our investment portfolio 
at december   the gaap reserves of equity indexed annuities totaled billion which provide guaranteed rates based on a cumulative floor over the term of the product 
in 
table of contents addition  for deposits allocated to equity indexed crediting strategies  we use a portion of the deposits to purchase call options 
we may affect the cost of the call options by adjusting interest crediting parameters that are provided for in the policy 
our return on the call options is generally expected  in a growing equity market  to correspond to the earnings we are contractually bound to credit on the equity indexed strategies 
the remainder of the deposit is invested in our investment portfolio to support the contractual minimum guarantees that may come into effect if the equity index declines 
the product spread on deposits allocated to our equity indexed strategy is computed as yield minus cost of options and interest credited product spread the product spread is a major driver of profitability of our equity indexed annuity products 
the structure of our product  together with the allocation of our equity indexed strategy deposits between call options and our investment portfolio  is intended to provide for a positive product spread in both increasing and decreasing equity markets 
equity indexed annuity sales increased in and as compared to the prior year periods due to its popularity with consumers and agents 
in the third quarter of  we entered into a new modified coinsurance reinsurance agreement to cede of certain equity indexed annuity products which amounted to million and million of ceded premium in and  respectively 
variable annuities 
through our acquisition of ilico  we obtained a variable annuity product line 
in the first quarter of  we ceased new sales of these products  except for new policies issued as part of existing employer sponsored qualified plan contracts 
all sales were discontinued effective september  our agents are encouraged to make new sales of variable annuities through the ameritas joint venture 
as these sales are through the joint venture  they do not appear in our direct sales amounts 
see the discussion related to this joint venture in the ameritas joint venture section 
the assets and liabilities related to the direct variable annuities are shown on the consolidated balance sheets as separate account assets and separate account liabilities 
funding agreements 
we placed primarily fixed rate funding agreements totaling million in funding agreements are insurance contracts for which we receive deposit funds and for which we agree to repay the deposit and a contractual return for the duration of the contract 
in december  a million funding agreement was terminated 
total funding agreements outstanding as of december   amounted to million compared to billion outstanding at december  the following table sets forth information regarding fixed annuities in force for each date presented annuities in force as of december  in thousands deferred fixed annuities number of policies gaap annuity reserves equity indexed annuities number of policies gaap annuity reserves total fixed annuities number of policies gaap annuity reserves distribution systems we sell annuities in all states  the district of columbia and the us virgin islands 
the states with the highest geographic concentration of sales  based on statutory premiums  are california  florida  iowa  ohio  pennsylvania and texas in these states account for approximately of our statutory premiums 

table of contents we direct our marketing efforts towards the asset accumulation  conservative savings and retirement markets 
we market our annuity products on a national basis primarily through networks of independent agents 
the independent agents are supervised by regional vice presidents and regional directors or imos 
at december   we had approximately  independent agents licensed to sell our annuity products 
in addition  the preferred producer agency and ppga systems discussed previously are utilized to market certain annuity products 
our imos consist of approximately contracted organizations  including five wholly owned organizations and one organization which principally sells our proprietary products 
the imos are responsible for recruiting  servicing and educating agents in an effort to promote our products 
the imos receive an override commission based on the business produced by their agents 
our wholly owned and proprietary organizations accounted for approximately of our annuity sales in we do not have exclusive agency agreements with our agents and we believe most of these agents sell products similar to ours for other insurance companies 
ameritas joint venture we participate in a joint venture  the ameritas joint venture  with ameritas life insurance corp 
or ameritas through alic s ownership interest in amal corporation  a nebraska corporation 
amal corporation s operations are conducted through ameritas variable life insurance company  or avlic  ameritas investment corp 
or aic  and the advisors group  inc or tag  its three wholly owned subsidiaries 
avlic is licensed to conduct business in states and the district of columbia 
aic and tag are registered broker dealers 
our partner in the ameritas joint venture  ameritas  is a nebraska mutual life insurance company which has been in existence for more than years 
our investment in the ameritas joint venture provides access to a line of existing variable life insurance and annuity products while providing a lower cost entry into an established business  helping to eliminate significant start up costs and allowing for immediate potential earnings 
the ameritas joint venture offers  through avlic  fixed annuity products  flexible premium and single premium variable universal life insurance products  and variable annuities 
variable products provide for allocation of funds to a general account or to one or more separate accounts under which the owner bears the investment risk 
through avlic s fund managers  owners of variable annuities and life insurance policies are able to choose from a range of investment funds offered by each manager 
under the current terms of the joint venture agreement  alic and ameritas direct their new variable annuities and variable life insurance through the ameritas joint venture 
the variable life insurance products and the fixed and variable annuities offered by the ameritas joint venture are distributed through our preferred producer general agency  ppga systems and one imo  as well as through the distribution systems of ameritas and avlic 
under the terms of the joint venture agreement  we purchased an additional of amal corporation in march  for million as certain premium growth targets were met which brought our total ownership in amal corporation to 
during  ameritas contributed additional investments  certain in force business and other assets to the ameritas joint venture which resulted in the reduction of our ownership from to 
in addition  in december  both ameritas and alic contributed additional cash  which amounted to million by alic  to maintain our interest 
alic and ameritas life insurance company each have guaranteed the policyholder obligations of avlic 
the guarantee of each party is joint and several  and will remain in effect until certain conditions are met 
as of december   amal corporation had total consolidated assets of million and total consolidated shareholder s equity of million on a gaap basis 
avlic had  million of insurance in force and million in surplus as of december   on a statutory basis 

table of contents competition we operate in a highly competitive industry 
we compete with numerous life insurance companies and other entities including banks and other financial institutions  many of which have greater financial and other resources 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in the sale of insurance products are product features  price  commission structure  perceived stability of the insurer  financial strength ratings  value added service and name recognition 
many other companies are capable of competing for sales in our target markets including companies that do not presently compete in such markets 
our ability to compete for sales is dependent upon our ability to successfully address the competitive factors 
we are the national leader in market share of equity indexed life production and are the fifteenth largest fixed life company in the united states 
we also rank second nationally in equity indexed annuity sales and sixth nationally in fixed annuity sales through independent agents 
the rankings are based on industry information from advantage compendium formerly the advantage group and life insurance marketing research associates 
in addition to competing for sales  we compete for qualified agents and brokers to distribute products 
strong competition exists among insurance companies for agents and brokers with demonstrated ability 
we believe that the bases of competition for the services of such agents and brokers are commission structure  support services  prior relationships and the strength of an insurer s products 
although we believe that we have good relationships with our agents and brokers  our ability to compete will depend on our continued ability to attract and retain qualified persons 
ratings ratings with respect to financial strength are an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies

am best s ratings for insurance companies range from a to s 
am best indicates that an a rating is assigned to those companies that in am best s opinion have achieved superior performance when compared to the norms of the life insurance industry and have demonstrated a strong ability to meet their policyowner and other contractual obligations 
moody s ratings for insurance companies range from aaa to c 
moody s indicates that a ratings are assigned to companies that have factors related to security of principal and interest which are considered adequate  however  elements are present which may suggest a susceptibility to impairment in the future 
in evaluating a company s financial and operating performance  
table of contents these rating agencies review a company s profitability  leverage and liquidity  book of business  adequacy and soundness of reinsurance  quality and estimated market value of assets  adequacy of policy reserves  experience and competency of management and other factors 
such ratings are neither a rating of securities nor a recommendation to buy  hold or sell any security  including our common stock and they may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the relevant rating agency 
you should evaluate each rating independently of any other rating 
on september   moody s investor services changed the rating outlook for all of our insurance subsidiaries to negative from stable 
also  on may   am best company changed the rating outlook for all of our insurance subsidiaries to negative from stable 
the changes occurred as part of moody s and am best s assessments of their current life insurers ratings given the current operating environment 
a negative outlook indicates that if certain trends continue or worsen  the rating agencies believe the insurance subsidiaries ratings may have to be adjusted downward 
there have been no further changes from either of these rating agencies 
insurance underwriting we follow detailed  uniform underwriting practices and procedures in our insurance business which are designed to assess risks before issuing coverage to qualified applicants 
we have professional underwriters who evaluate policy applications on the basis of information provided by applicants and others 
reinsurance in accordance with industry practices  we reinsure portions of our life insurance exposure with unaffiliated insurance companies under traditional indemnity reinsurance arrangements 
such reinsurance arrangements are in accordance with standard reinsurance practices within the industry 
we enter into these arrangements to assist in diversifying risks and to limit the maximum loss on risks that exceed policy retention limits 
indemnity reinsurance does not fully discharge our obligation to pay claims on business we reinsure 
as the ceding company  we remain responsible for policy claims to the extent the reinsurer fails to pay such claims 
we continually monitor the creditworthiness of our primary reinsurers  and have experienced no material reinsurance recoverability problems in recent years 
for accounting purposes  premiums and expenses in the income statement are reported net of reinsurance ceded 
future life and annuity policy benefits  policyowner funds and other related assets and liabilities are not reduced for reinsurance ceded in the balance sheet  rather a reinsurance receivable is established for such balance sheet items 
we reinsure mortality risk on individual life insurance policies 
our retention is generally between  and  on any single life depending on the respective age and rating table 
we also reinsure certain annuity business primarily on a modified coinsurance basis 
at december  and  we ceded life insurance with a face amount of billion with unaffiliated reinsurers and life insurance with a face amount of billion with unaffiliated reinsurers  respectively

the following is a summary of our principal annuity reinsurers as of december  of total face am best face amount reinsurer amount ceded rating reinsured in billions transamerica occidental life insurance company a rga reinsurance company a employees as of december   we had  full time employees 
none of these employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement and we believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory 
government regulation we are subject to regulation by the states in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled and or transact business 
state insurance laws generally establish supervisory agencies with broad administrative and supervisory powers related to granting and revoking licenses  transacting business  regulating the payment of dividends to stockholders  establishing guaranty fund associations  licensing agents  approving policy forms  regulating sales practices  regulating premium rates for some lines of business  establishing reserve requirements  prescribing the form and content of required financial statements and reports  determining the reasonableness and adequacy of statutory capital and surplus  and regulating the type and amount of investments permitted 
every state in which our insurance companies are licensed administers a guaranty fund  which provides for assessments of licensed insurers for the protection of policyowners of insolvent insurance companies 
assessments can be partially recovered through a reduction in future premium taxes in some states 
risk based capital  or rbc  standards for life insurance companies were adopted by the national association of insurance commissioners  known as the naic  and require insurance companies to calculate and report for statutory basis financial statements information under a risk based capital formula 
the rbc requirements are intended to allow insurance regulators to identify at an early stage inadequately capitalized insurance companies based upon the types and mixtures of risks inherent in such companies operations 
the formula includes components for asset risk  liability risk  interest rate exposure and other factors 
as of december   each of our life insurance companies rbc levels was in excess of authorized control level rbc thresholds established by insurance regulators 
although the federal government generally does not directly regulate the insurance business  federal initiatives and changes in federal law can often have a material impact on the business in a variety of ways 
current and proposed federal measures that may significantly affect the insurance business include limitations on antitrust immunity  minimum solvency requirements  changes to the tax advantages of life insurance and annuity products or the programs with which they are used  new savings and dividend proposals and the removal of barriers restricting banks from engaging in the insurance and mutual fund business

item legal proceedings in recent years  the life insurance industry  including the company and its subsidiaries  have been subject to an increase in litigation pursued on behalf of purported classes of insurance purchasers  questioning the conduct of insurers in the marketing of their products 
the company is routinely involved in litigation and other proceedings  including class actions  reinsurance claims and regulatory proceedings  arising in the ordinary course of its business 
some of these claims and legal actions are in jurisdictions where juries are given substantial latitude in assessing damages  including punitive damages 
although no assurances can be given and no determinations can be made at this time  the company believes that the ultimate liability  if any  with respect to these claims and legal actions  would have no material effect on its results of operations and financial position

operating segment income decreased for the protection products segment in compared to primarily as a result of lower net investment income and the continued decrease in closed block operating income 
the acquisition of ilico  combined with a slight growth in margins  increased protection products segment operating income in compared to the increased volume of equity indexed products and additional income from funding agreements increased accumulation products segment earnings in compared to increased imo operating income and the discontinuation of goodwill amortization in contributed to the growth in accumulation products segment operating income in compared to net income increased in compared to primarily due to increased realized gains on open block investments and increased net unrealized gains from market value adjustments on trading securities  derivatives and equity indexed contracts 
net income decreased in compared to primarily as a result of realized losses on investments  unrealized losses from market value adjustments on derivatives and increased restructuring charges 
the reductions in net income were partially offset by the higher income of our protection and accumulation products segments 
total assets increased billion during primarily as a result of additional invested assets under management resulting from additional life sales and annuity deposits 
stockholders equity increased million during as a result of net income of million and the issuance of common stock under various incentive plans of million 
the increase was partially offset by dividends declared in of million and fees  expenses and liabilities associated with the issuance of prides  which reduced equity million 

table of contents segment income we use the same accounting policies and procedures to measure operating segment income as we use to measure consolidated income from operations with the exception of the elimination of certain items which management believes are not necessarily indicative of overall operating trends 
these items are shown between segment pre tax operating income and net income and are as follows realized gains and losses on open block investments 
market value changes and amortization of assets and liabilities associated with the accounting for derivatives  such as unrealized gains and losses on open block options and securities held for trading 
change in option value of equity indexed products and market value adjustments on total return strategy annuities 
cash flow hedge amortization amortization of a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability 
amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs dac and value of business acquired voba related to the realized gains and losses on the open block investments and the derivative adjustments 
certain reinsurance adjustments 
demutualization costs 
restructuring costs 
other income from non insurance operations 
discontinued operations 
cumulative effect of changes in accounting method 
these items will fluctuate from period to period depending on the prevailing interest rate and economic environment  or are not continuing in nature  or are not part of the core insurance operations 
as a result  management believes they do not reflect the ongoing earnings capacity of our operating segments 
protection products our protection products segment primarily consists of interest sensitive whole life  term life  universal life and equity indexed life insurance policies 
these products are marketed on a national basis primarily through a preferred producer agency system  ppga distribution system and imos 
included in protection products segment is the closed block of alic and the closed block of ilic 
each closed block was established when the companies reorganized from mutual companies to stock companies 
when protection products are sold  we invest the premiums we receive in our investment portfolio and establish a liability to the policyholder 
we manage investment spread by seeking to maximize the return on these invested assets  consistent with our asset liability and credit quality needs 
we enter into reinsurance arrangements in order to reduce the effects of mortality risk and the statutory capital strain from writing new business 
all income statement line items are presented net of reinsurance amounts 
protection products in force totaled billion at december   billion at december  and billion at december  protection products in force is a non gaap financial measure utilized by investors  analysts and the company to assess the company s 
table of contents position in the industry 
we do not believe there is a comparable gaap financial measure 
a summary of our protection products segment operations follows for the years ended december  in thousands revenues insurance premiums product charges net investment income realized gains losses on closed block investments other income total revenues benefits and expenses policyowner benefits underwriting  acquisition and other expenses amortization of dac and voba  net of open block gain loss adjustment dividends to policyowners total benefits and expenses pre tax operating income protection products segment pre tax operating income from our protection products decreased in and increased in compared to the respective prior years 
higher product margins increased open block operating income million in  however  operating income of the closed block decreased million in compared to  as the closed block continues to reflect the declining closed block glide path see dividends to policyowners for additional information 
the increase in was due to a slight growth in product margins and the acquisition of ilico 
the key drivers of our protection products business include sales  persistency  net investment income  mortality and expenses 
sales  premiums and product charges 
sales are a key driver of our business as they are a leading indicator of future revenue trends to emerge in segment operating income 
as shown in the sales activity product table presented in item business protection products segment  direct sales decreased in compared to and increased in compared to the decrease in resulted from lower traditional and universal life insurance product sales as we re priced our products and discontinued our par whole life product 
in addition  interest sensitive whole life sales were lower due to uncertainty in government tax policy and regulation 
interest sensitive whole life insurance has cash value accumulation that changes with current interest and mortality rates 
the lower traditional and universal sales were partially offset by increased equity indexed life sales as we continue to focus our marketing efforts on those products 
the increase in was primarily due to the acquisition of ilico during the second quarter of and growth we experienced in almost all our protection product lines in  especially in our equity indexed life products 
the equity indexed life product allows the policyowner to elect an earnings strategy for a portion of the account value whereby earnings are credited based primarily on increases in the s p index  excluding dividends 
the earnings credit is subject to a participation rate and an annual cap 
sales of equity indexed life products were million in as compared to million in and million in we are a leading writer of equity indexed life products in the united states 
we recognize premiums on traditional life insurance policies as revenues when the premiums are due 
amounts received as payments for universal life and equity indexed life insurance policies are not recorded as premium revenue  but are instead recorded as a policyholder liability 
revenues from the universal life and equity indexed life policies consist of product charges for the cost of insurance  policy administration and 
table of contents policy surrender 
all revenue is reported net of reinsurance ceded 
insurance premium revenue was lower in compared to due to lower sales of traditional products  additional premiums ceded and a decline in closed block in force business 
product charge revenue was higher in compared to due to the growth in the equity indexed life block of business and fluctuations in reinsurance premiums 
insurance premium revenue increased in as compared to primarily due to the acquisition of ilico 
product charge revenue decreased in as compared to primarily due to a new reinsurance arrangement on universal life products 
persistency 
persistency is a key driver of our business as it refers to the policies which remain in our block of business and is measured by the lapse rate 
a low lapse rate reflects higher persistency indicating more business is remaining in force to generate future revenues 
annualized lapse rates were in compared to in and in our persistency experience remained within our pricing assumptions 
the lapse rate in was higher due to the completion of ilico s demutualization payout in july lapses tend to decline in anticipation of a demutualization transaction as policyholders want to remain policyholders so they will be eligible for the demutualization payout 
following a demutualization  lapses tend to increase for a period before they return to a more normal level 
net investment income 
net investment income is a key driver of our business as it reflects earnings on our invested assets 
net investment income decreased in and increased in compared to the respective prior years 
the decrease in net investment income in was due to low interest rates and increased prepayments of mortgage backed securities 
the increase in net investment income was primarily attributable to the acquisition of ilico 
the earned rate of the investment portfolio was in compared to in and in the decrease in rates in and was primarily a result of the lower interest rate environment 
mortality and benefit expense 
mortality is a key driver of our business as this item reflects benefit expense 
for and  we experienced favorable mortality 
total benefit expense was higher in compared to due to the acquisition of ilico 
total policyowner benefits for ilico increased million in compared to in addition  we had increased reinsurance recoveries in and  which reduce benefit expense  as a result of additional reinsurance arrangements 
underwriting  acquisition and other expenses 
underwriting  acquisition and other expenses are a key driver of our business as they reflect costs of our operations 
expenses decreased in compared to primarily due to increased reimbursement from reinsurers of non deferrable commission and expense allowances  as more policies are subject to reinsurance  and expense changes resulting from the restructuring activities 
expenses increased in compared to primarily due to the acquisition of ilico for a full year in compared to a partial year in ilico expenses increased million in compared to amortization of dac and voba 
the amortization of dac and voba are expense items which increased in and as compared to the respective prior years 
dac and voba are generally amortized in proportion to policy gross margins which increased in  resulting in higher amortization expense 
amortization expense increased in compared to primarily due to the acquisition of ilico 
dividends to policyowners 
dividend expense decreased in compared to and increased in compared to dividend expense includes increases or decreases to the closed block policyowner dividend obligation liability carried on the consolidated balance sheet 
to the extent cumulative actual earnings of the closed block exceed the cumulative expected earnings based on the actuarial calculation at the time of formation of the closed block which we refer to as the closed block glide path  a policyowner dividend obligation is recorded 
the higher realized gains in as compared to losses in increased closed block earnings  which in turn  were added to the policyowner dividend obligation liability 
lower investment income was experienced in the closed block in which decreased dividend expense offsetting the increase for realized gains 
in addition  the reinsurance adjustment related to the settlement activity of the closed block in the second quarter of  caused an increase in the dividend expense and related policyowner dividend obligation liability for see the reinsurance adjustments section for additional information 

table of contents the increased dividends in as compared to were primarily due to the acquisition of ilico in and the dividends associated with its closed block 
outlook 
we expect to continue to shift our sales to higher return products  in particular the equity indexed life products 
we also expect to continue to realize operating efficiencies created by the restructuring of the protection products operations and centralization of our administrative functions as discussed later in restructuring costs 
accumulation products our accumulation products segment primary offerings consist of individual fixed annuities and funding agreements 
the fixed annuities are marketed on a national basis primarily through imos and independent brokers 
similar to our protection products segment  we invest the premiums we receive from accumulation product deposits in our investment portfolio and establish a liability representing our commitment to our policyholder 
we manage product spread by seeking to maximize the return on our invested assets consistent with our asset liability management and credit quality needs 
when appropriate  we periodically reset the interest rates credited to our policyholder liability 
accumulation products reserves totaled billion at december   billion at december  and billion at december  a summary of our accumulation products segment operations follows for the years ended december  in thousands revenues immediate annuity and supplementary contract premiums product charges net investment income other income total revenues benefits and expenses policyowner benefits underwriting  acquisition and other expenses amortization of dac and voba total benefits and expenses imo operations other income other expenses net imo operating income pre tax operating income accumulation products segment pre tax operating income from our accumulation products operations increased in and in compared to the respective prior years 
the increased volume of equity indexed annuities and additional income from funding agreements increased accumulation products earnings in the increase was partially offset by reduced product margins and lower contributions from imo operations 
the increase in was primarily due to increased imo operating income and the discontinuation of goodwill amortization 
the drivers of profitability in our accumulation products business are deposits  persistency  product spread  expenses and imo operations 
deposits 
deposits are a key driver of our business as this is a measure which represents collected premiums to be deposited to policyowner accounts for which we will earn a future product spread 
deposits are presented as collected premiums  which are measured in accordance with industry practice  and represent the 
table of contents amount of new business sold during the period 
deposits are a non gaap financial measure for an insurance company for which there is no comparable gaap financial measure 
we use deposits to measure the productivity of our distribution network and as a basis for compensation of sales and marketing employees and agents 
as shown in the deposits by product table presented in item business accumulation products segment  total annuity deposits decreased in compared to and decreased in as compared to the decrease was primarily a result of our slowing of our traditional annuity sales due to the low interest rate environment as we focused sales on our higher returning equity indexed products 
the reduced traditional annuity sales offset the increase in equity indexed products 
the decrease resulted from the deployment of capital to funding agreements which provide a higher return on equity 
we placed fixed rate funding agreements totaling million in funding agreements are insurance contracts for which we receive deposit funds and for which we agree to repay the deposit and a contractual return for the duration of the contract 
in december  a million funding agreement originally placed in was terminated 
total funding agreements outstanding as of december  amounted to million compared to billion outstanding at december  the deposits we receive on accumulation products are not recorded as revenue but instead as a policyowner liability 
surrender charges are recorded as revenue as a product charge 
product charges increased in as compared to due to the growth in business and increased in as compared to due to the acquisition of ilico 
persistency 
persistency is a key driver of our business as it refers to the policies which remain in our block of business and is measured by the withdrawal rate 
a low withdrawal rate reflects higher persistency indicating more business is remaining in force to generate future revenues 
withdrawals represent funds taken out of accumulation products by policyowners not including those due to the death of policyowners 
annuity withdrawal rates without internal replacements continued to improve in as compared to and and amounted to  and  respectively 
annuity withdrawals without internal replacements totaled  million in   million in and  million in our withdrawal experience remained within our pricing assumptions 
withdrawal rates declined in and as compared to the respective prior years as our annuity products provide a favorable investment return in this current low interest rate environment 
product spread 
product spread is a key driver of our business as it measures the difference between the income earned on our invested assets and the rate which we credit to policyowners  the difference is reflected as segment operating income 
asset earned rates and liability crediting rates were as follows for annuity segment products for the years ended december  asset earned rate liability credited rate product spread the product spread decreased three basis points to basis points in compared to the product spread decreased basis points to basis points in compared to liability crediting rates on traditional annuities were lowered in the fourth quarter of and throughout to correspond with the decline in investment yields caused by lower rates on new and reinvested funds 
as described in the traditional annuity products and equity indexed annuities sections presented in item business accumulation products segment  the annuity products have various differentials between the credited rate and minimum guarantee rate  including some which have no differential  and as such cannot be lowered 
additionally  some traditional annuities have multi year interest rate guarantees for which the credited rate cannot be decreased until the end of the multi year period 
also  equity indexed annuities provide guaranteed rates based on a cumulative floor over the term of the product 
due to these limitations on the ability to lower 
table of contents interest crediting rates and the potential for credit defaults and lower reinvestment rates on investments  we could experience additional spread compression in future periods 
funding agreement income increased million in compared to and increased million in compared to the increase was due to the million of funding agreements placed throughout underwriting  acquisition and other expenses 
underwriting  acquisition and other expenses are a key driver of our business as they represent costs of our operations 
expenses in decreased as compared to due primarily to lower fees associated with a declining block of annuity business processed by a third party administrator 
expenses decreased in compared to primarily due to goodwill no longer being amortized effective january  with the adoption of sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill amortization amounted to million in imo operations 
imo operations are a key driver of our business as the earnings from the imos are a significant component of the accumulation products segment operating income 
imos have contractual arrangements to promote our insurance products in their networks of agents and brokers 
additionally  they also contract with third party insurance companies 
we own five such imos 
the income from imo operations primarily represents annuity commissions received by our imos from those third party insurance companies 
net imo operating income decreased million in compared to due to increased expenses and increased million in compared to due to our acquisition of an imo in outlook 
we anticipate increased product sales from our imos but decreased product sales from other distribution as we manage our sales in this current low interest rate environment 
we also expect to continue the shift of our product mix to higher return products  in particular the equity indexed annuity products 
we will continue to manage our spreads as we strive for our desired profitability in this economic environment 
other the other segment is our non core lines of business outside of protection and accumulation products 
these lines of business include holding company revenues and expenses  operations of our real estate management subsidiary  and accident and health insurance 
the other segment pre tax operating loss increased in and as compared to the respective prior years primarily due to real estate investment and management fee income which continues to decline as we reduce these investment holdings 
in addition  the operating gain in included investment fee income for asset management services provided to ilico prior to the acquisition amounting to million 
after the acquisition of ilico  such fees are eliminated in consolidation 

table of contents income statement reconciliation a reconciliation of our segment pre tax operating income to net income as shown in our consolidated statements of income follows for the years ended december  in thousands segment pre tax operating income protection products accumulation products other operations total segment pre tax operating income non segment items increases decreases to income realized and unrealized gains losses on assets and liabilities realized gains losses on open block investments unrealized gains losses on open block options and trading investments change in option value of equity indexed products and market value adjustments on total return strategy annuities cash flow hedge amortization amortization of dac voba due to open block realized gains and losses reinsurance adjustments demutualization costs restructuring costs other income from non insurance operations income from continuing operations interest expense income tax expense net income from continuing operations income from discontinued operations  net of tax cumulative effect of change in accounting  net of tax net income realized and unrealized gains losses on assets and liabilities 
realized gains losses on open block investments will fluctuate from period to period depending on the prevailing interest rate  the economic environment  the timing of investment sales and credit events 
realized gains on open block investments in included million of gains on sales of investments previously impaired and written down in or  primarily american airlines  dynegy holdings  intermedia communications and nrg northeast generating 
realized gains losses on open block investments in consisted primarily of realized losses and writedowns on investments related to dynegy holdings  green tree financial  national century  nrg northeast generating  trenwick group  united airlines  us air and worldcom inc the realized losses in consisted primarily of writedowns on investments mainly related to telecommunications and emerging markets investments 
unrealized gains losses on open block options and trading investments also will fluctuate from period to period depending on prevailing interest rates  the economic environment  the timing of investment sales and credit events 
we use options to hedge our equity indexed products 
in accounting for derivatives  we adjusted our options to market value  which  due to the economic environment and stock market conditions  resulted in 
table of contents an unrealized gain of million in and an unrealized loss of million in and an unrealized loss of million in in addition  we also have trading securities that back our total return strategy traditional annuity products 
the market value adjustment on the trading securities resulted in an unrealized gain of million in  a loss of million in and a loss of million in most of the unrealized gains and losses on the options and trading securities are offset by similar adjustments to the option portion of the equity indexed product reserves and to the total return strategy annuity reserves 
the reserve adjustments are reflected in policyowner benefits expense in the consolidated statements of income and are included in the fair value change as additional expense of million in  reduced expense of million in and reduced expense of million in as explained in the following paragraph 
the fair value change in options embedded within our equity indexed products and the fair value changes on our total return strategy traditional annuity contracts are being recorded at fair value 
as previously discussed  these fair value changes are offset by similar adjustments to unrealized gains losses on investments related to the fair value changes on the options that hedge the equity indexed products and on the trading securities that back the total return strategy products 
the reduction in such contract expense is less than the decline in investment income primarily due to the inability to lower crediting rates below minimum guaranteed interest rates 
reinsurance adjustments 
reinsurance related adjustments in consist of the release of a million liability in conjunction with the settlement and amendment of a reinsurance arrangement and a million true up of pre reinsurance settlements under a reinsurance arrangement between ilic s open block and closed block 
demutualization costs 
the demutualization costs are associated with the demutualization of ilic  which was completed when we acquired ilico in may as a requirement of ilic s demutualization  we undertook a commission free program under which shareholders with less than one hundred shares could redeem those shares for cash or purchase additional shares  commission free  to reach a holding of at least one hundred shares 
the costs are primarily for commissions  postage and printing under this program 
since these costs are not ongoing  they have been excluded from our segment results 
restructuring costs 
restructuring costs relate to our consolidation of various functions in connection with a restructuring of our protection products and accumulation products operations and investment activities which began in the third quarter of the objective of the restructuring plan was to eliminate duplicative functions for all business units and to reduce on going operating costs 
corporate administrative functions were transitioned so they are performed primarily in des moines  iowa 
protection products administration processes were transitioned so they are performed in des moines  woodbury  new york  or outsourced 
accumulation products functions were transitioned to topeka  kansas 
investment activities were restructured to eliminate certain real estate management services which have been outsourced 
we listed an office building located in indianapolis  indiana  with a real estate broker in  and we vacated the location as a result of staff reductions 
in addition  those employees who are going to work in indianapolis moved to a new location 
we determined that the plan of sale criteria in sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  had been met 
accordingly  the carrying value of the building was adjusted to its fair value less costs to sell  amounting to million  which was based upon comparable properties recently marketed in indianapolis 
the resulting million pre tax impairment loss was recorded as restructuring costs in the consolidated statement of income in the carrying value of the building that is held for sale is included in the other assets line item of the consolidated balance sheet 
during  we initiated and executed a restructuring plan to merge one of our subsidiaries  il annuity  into its parent  ilic 
the merger was effective june   and total restructuring costs associated with this plan amounted to million pre tax  which primarily consisted of legal  accounting  and printing costs and the write off of million of insurance licenses 
the restructuring charges expensed in included pre tax severance and termination benefits of million related to the termination of approximately ten positions and for severance accrual adjustments and other pre tax costs of million primarily related to the impairment loss on the indianapolis office 
table of contents building  expenses associated with the merger of il annuity into ilic  and systems conversion costs

an accrual for severance and termination benefits not yet paid amounted to million at december  charges for all restructuring activities were completed in interest expense 
interest expense increased in as compared to and the increase was primarily due to interest associated with the prides securities of million issued in the second quarter of discontinued operations 
in november  we entered into an agreement to sell our residential financing operations 
the results of the residential financing operations have been classified as discontinued operations 
the sale was completed in january  resulting in an after tax gain of approximately million to be recognized in change in accounting

dig issue b considers the reinsurer s receivable from the ceding company to contain an embedded derivative that must be bifurcated and accounted for separately under sfas we adopted dig issue b on october   which included the reclassification of certain securities supporting the products being reinsured from available for sale to held for trading 
the net cumulative effect of the change in accounting for dig issue b after income taxes was an expense of million in we adopted sfas on january  in accordance with the provisions of the statement  we recorded the differences between the previous carrying amounts of our derivative instruments and the fair value of our derivative instruments  as of this initial application date  as the effect of a change in accounting principle 
the gross difference between carrying amounts and fair value amounts of our derivative instruments was a reduction of approximately million 
the adjustment to the dac and voba amortization related to the impact from the derivative charge was an expense of approximately million and the income tax benefit was million  resulting in the net cumulative effect of change in accounting for derivatives expense of million in liquidity and capital resources amerus group co 
as a holding company  amerus group co 
s cash flows from operations consist of dividends from subsidiaries  if declared and paid  interest from income on loans and advances to subsidiaries including a surplus note issued to us by alic  investment income on our assets and fees which we charge our subsidiaries  offset by the expenses incurred for debt service  salaries and other expenses 
we intend to rely primarily on dividends and interest income from our insurance subsidiaries in order to make dividend payments to our shareholders 
the payment of dividends by our insurance subsidiaries is regulated under various state laws 
generally  under the various state statutes  our insurance subsidiaries dividends may be paid only from the earned surplus arising from their respective businesses and must receive the prior approval of the respective state regulator to pay any dividend that would exceed certain statutory limitations 
the current statutes generally limit any dividend  together with dividends paid out within the preceding months  to the greater of i of the respective company s policyowners statutory surplus as of the preceding year end or ii the statutory net gain from operations for the previous calendar year 

table of contents generally  the various state laws give the state regulators discretion to approve or disapprove requests for dividends in excess of these limits 
based on these limitations and results  our life insurance subsidiaries could have paid us approximately million in dividends in without obtaining regulatory approval 
our subsidiaries paid us approximately million in that included dividends for which we obtained regulatory approval 
based on results  our subsidiaries can pay an estimated million in dividends without obtaining regulatory approval during we also consider risk based capital levels  capital and liquidity operating needs  and other factors prior to paying dividends from the insurance subsidiaries 
we generated cash flows from operating activities of million  million and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
operating cash flows were primarily used to increase our investment portfolio 
we have a million revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders which we refer to as the revolving credit agreement 
as of december   there was a million outstanding loan balance under the facility 
the revolving credit agreement provides for typical events of default and covenants with respect to the conduct of business and requires the maintenance of various financial levels and ratios 
among other covenants  we a cannot have a leverage ratio greater than  b cannot have an interest coverage ratio less than  c are prohibited from paying cash dividends on common stock in excess of an amount equal to of consolidated net worth as of the last day of the preceding fiscal year  d must cause our insurance subsidiaries to maintain certain levels of risk based capital  and e are prohibited from incurring additional indebtedness for borrowed money in excess of certain limits typical for such lines of credit 
we closely monitor all of these covenants to ensure continued compliance 
on may   we issued million of prides securities 
on june   the underwriters exercised their over allotment option in full and the company issued an additional million of prides 
on march   we issued and sold in a private placement million aggregate original principal amount of oceans 
the issuance of prides and oceans were previously discussed in item market for registrant s common equity and related stockholder matters  which portions are incorporated herein by reference 
the company has several options for deploying excess capital  including supporting higher sales growth  reducing debt levels  pursuing acquisitions and buying back common stock 
we may resume purchasing shares of our common stock pursuant to the repurchase program previously approved by the company s board of directors 
our board of directors approved a stock purchase program effective august   under which we may purchase up to three million shares of our common stock at such times and under such conditions  as we deem advisable 
the purchases may be made in the open market or by such other means as we determine to be appropriate  including privately negotiated purchases 
the purchase program supercedes all prior purchase programs 
we plan to fund the purchase program from a combination of our internal sources  dividends from insurance subsidiaries and the revolving credit agreement 
approximately million shares remain available for repurchase under this program 
there were no significant shares purchased in we manage liquidity on a continuing basis 
one way is to minimize our need for capital 
we accomplish this by attempting to use our capital as efficiently as possible and by developing capital efficient products in our insurance subsidiaries 
we manage our mix of sales by focusing on the more capital efficient products 
in addition  we use reinsurance agreements  where cost effective  to reduce capital strain in the insurance subsidiaries 
we also focus on optimizing the consolidated capital structure to properly balance the levels and sources of borrowing and the issuance of equity securities 
insurance subsidiaries the cash flows of our insurance subsidiaries consist primarily of premium income  deposits to policyowner account balances  income from investments  sales  maturities and calls of investments and repayments of investment principal 
cash outflows are primarily related to withdrawals of policyowner account balances  investment purchases  payment of policy acquisition costs  payment of policyowner benefits  payment of debt  income taxes and current operating expenses 
insurance companies generally produce a positive cash flow from operations  as measured by the amount by which cash flows are adequate to meet 
table of contents benefit obligations to policyowners and normal operating expenses as they are incurred 
the remaining cash flow is generally used to increase the asset base to provide funds to meet the need for future policy benefit payments and for writing new business 
management believes that the current level of cash and available for sale  held for trading and short term securities  combined with expected net cash inflows from operations  maturities of fixed maturity investments  principal payments on mortgage backed securities and sales of its insurance products  will be adequate to meet the anticipated short term cash obligations of the insurance subsidiaries 
matching the investment portfolio maturities to the cash flow demands of the type of insurance being provided is an important consideration for each type of protection product and accumulation product 
we continuously monitor benefits and surrenders to provide projections of future cash requirements 
as part of this monitoring process  we perform cash flow testing of assets and liabilities under various scenarios to evaluate the adequacy of reserves 
in developing our investment strategy  we establish a level of cash and securities which  combined with expected net cash inflows from operations and maturities and principal payments on fixed maturity investment securities  are believed adequate to meet anticipated short term and long term benefit and expense payment obligations 
there can be no assurance that future experience regarding benefits and surrenders will be similar to historic experience since withdrawal and surrender levels are influenced by such factors as the interest rate environment and general economic conditions and the claims paying and financial strength ratings of the insurance subsidiaries 
we take into account asset liability management considerations in the product development and design process 
contract terms for the interest sensitive products include surrender and withdrawal provisions which mitigate the risk of losses due to early withdrawals 
these provisions generally do one or more of the following limit the amount of penalty free withdrawals  limit the circumstances under which withdrawals are permitted  or assess a surrender charge or market value adjustment relating to the underlying assets 
in addition to the interest sensitive products  our insurance subsidiaries placed additional funding agreements totaling million primarily in six to ten year fixed rate insurance contracts during the assets backing the funding agreements are legally segregated and are not subject to claims that arise out of any other business of the insurance subsidiaries 
the funding agreements are further backed by the general account assets of the insurance subsidiaries 
the segregated assets and liabilities are included with general account assets in the financial statements 
the funding agreements may not be cancelled unless there is a default under the agreement  but the insurance subsidiaries may terminate the agreement at any time 
during  a million funding agreement which was placed in was terminated 
total funding agreements of million were outstanding as of december  we also have variable separate account assets and liabilities representing funds that are separately administered  principally for variable annuity contracts  and for which the contractholder bears the investment risk 
separate account assets and liabilities are reported at fair value and amounted to million at december  separate account contractholders have no claim against the assets of the general account 
the operations of the separate accounts are not included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
through their respective memberships in the federal home loan banks fhlb of des moines and topeka  alic and american are eligible to borrow under variable rate short term fed funds arrangements to provide additional liquidity 
these borrowings are secured and interest is payable at the current rate at the time of each advance 
there were borrowings totaling million outstanding under these arrangements at december  in addition  alic has long term fixed rate advances from the fhlb outstanding of million at december  the insurance subsidiaries may also obtain liquidity through sales of investments 
the investment portfolio as of december   had a carrying value of billion  including closed block investments 
the level of capital in the insurance companies is regulated by risk based capital formulas and is monitored by rating agencies 
in order to maintain appropriate capital levels  it may be necessary from time to time for amerus group co 
to provide additional capital to the insurance companies 

table of contents at december   the statutory capital and surplus of the insurance subsidiaries was approximately million 
management believes that each insurance company has statutory capital which provides adequate risk based capital that exceeds required levels 
in the future  in addition to cash flows from operations and borrowing capacity  the insurance subsidiaries may obtain their required capital from amerus group co 
off balance sheet arrangements guarantee obligations we have an agreement with bank one  na whereby we guarantee the payment of loans made to certain managers and executives for the purpose of purchasing common stock and aces pursuant to the stock purchase program 
our liability in respect of the principal amount of loans is limited to million which was repaid in march by the participants 
we have also guaranteed interest and all other fees and obligations owing on the loans 
each participant in the program has agreed to repay any amounts paid by us under the guarantee in accordance with a reimbursement agreement with the participant 
this agreement was entered into in  prior to the restrictions imposed by the sarbanes oxley act regarding loans with executive officers 
certain partnership investments provide for commitments of future capital  loans or guarantees 
we have obligations to make future capital contributions to various partnerships of up to million at december  in addition  at december   we had loan guarantees which totaled million 
alic and its joint venture partner are contingently liable in the event avlic cannot meet its obligations 
at december   avlic had statutory assets of  million  liabilities of  million and surplus of million 
we are contingently liable for the portion of the policies reinsured under existing reinsurance agreements in the event the reinsurance companies are unable to pay their portion of any reinsured claim 
management believes that any liability from this contingency is unlikely 
however  to limit the possibility of such losses  we evaluate the financial condition of reinsurers and monitor concentration of credit risk 
summary of contractual obligations and commitments our contractual obligations primarily consist of amounts owed for notes payable and operating lease commitments 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion about the notes payable and note for additional information regarding leases 
maturities of notes payable and lease obligations are as follows for each of the five years ending december  payments due by period obligation total thereafter in thousands notes payable operating leases capital leases purchase obligations other liabilities total critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the valuation of financial instruments  accounting for derivatives and amortization of dac and voba are considered our critical accounting policies due to their subjective nature and significance to the financial statements 

table of contents valuation of financial instruments a significant portion of our assets are carried at fair value  primarily securities available for sale  securities held for trading purposes and derivative financial instruments 
market values are based on quoted market prices where available 
securities in our portfolio with a carrying value of approximately  million and  million at december  and  respectively  do not have readily determinable market prices 
valuation techniques vary by security type and availability of market data 
fair values for securities which do not have a readily available market price are determined by a matrix process that uses a current market spread added to an applicable treasury rate to discount expected future cash flows applicable to the coupon rate  credit quality  industry sector and term of the investment  independent third party sources or recent transactions in similar securities  or internally prepared valuations incorporating standard valuation techniques 
certain market conditions that could impact the valuation of securities include credit ratings  business climate  economic environment  industry trends  and regulatory and legal risks events  among others 
all such investments are classified as available for sale 
our ability to liquidate our positions in these securities will be impacted to a significant degree by the lack of an actively traded market  and we may not be able to dispose of these investments in a timely manner 
although we believe our estimates reasonably reflect the fair value of those securities  our key assumptions about the risk free interest rates  risk premiums  performance of underlying collateral if any  and other factors may not be realized in the event of an actual sale 
securities are also reviewed to identify potential impairments 
in determining if and when a decline in market value below amortized cost is other than temporary  we evaluate the market conditions  offering prices  trends of earnings  price multiples and other key measures for our investments in marketable equity securities and debt instruments 
for fixed maturity securities  our intent and ability to hold securities is also considered 
when such a decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary  we recognize an impairment loss in the current period net income to the extent of the decline 
for additional information regarding our evaluation of otti  see the section titled investments impairment 
investments in mortgage loans  real estate  policy loans and other investments are monitored for possible impairment 
if it is determined that collection of all amounts due under the contractual terms is doubtful or carrying values exceed the fair value of underlying collateral  such investments are considered impaired and the asset carrying value is adjusted or a valuation allowance is established 
accounting for derivatives we hold derivative financial instruments to hedge growth in policyowner liabilities for certain protection and accumulation products and to hedge market risk for fixed income investments 
these derivatives qualify for hedge accounting or are considered economic hedges as discussed in detail in note to our consolidated financial statements 
hedge accounting results when we designate and document the hedging relationships involving derivative instruments 
economic hedging instruments are those instruments whose change in fair value acts as a natural hedge against the change in fair value of hedged assets or liabilities with both changes wholly or partially being offset in earnings 
to hedge equity market risk  we primarily use s p index call options to hedge the growth in interest credited to the customer as provided by our equity indexed products 
we may also use interest rate swaps or options to manage our fixed products risk profile 
generally  credit default swaps are coupled with a bond to synthetically create an instrument cheaper than an equivalent investment traded in the cash market 
we have not changed our methods of calculating the fair values of derivatives or the underlying assumptions 
the fair values of these derivatives will change over time as cash receipts and payments are made and as market conditions change 
our derivative instruments are not subject to a multiple or use of leverage on the underlying price index 
we do not believe we are exposed to more than a nominal amount of credit risk in our interest rate or equity 
table of contents hedges as the counterparties are established  well capitalized financial institutions 
information about the fair values  notional amounts  and contractual terms of these instruments can be found in note to our consolidated financial statements and the section titled quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
amortization of dac and voba we generally amortize dac based on a percentage of our expected gross margins egms over the life of the policies 
our estimated egms are computed based on assumptions related to the underlying policies written  including the lives of the underlying policies  growth rate of the assets supporting the liabilities  and level of expenses necessary to maintain the policies over their entire life 
we amortize dac by estimating the present value of the egms over the lives of the insurance policies and then calculate a percentage of the policy acquisition cost deferred as compared to the present value of the egms 
that percentage is used to amortize the dac such that the amount amortized over the life of the policies results in a constant percentage of amortization when related to the actual and future gross margins 
because the egms are only an estimate of the profits we expect to recognize from these policies  the egms are adjusted annually to take into consideration the actual gross profits to date and any changes in the remaining expected future gross margins 
when egms are adjusted  we also adjust the amortization of the deferred policy acquisition costs amount to maintain a constant percentage over the entire life of the policies 
we amortize the voba based on the incidence of the egms from insurance contracts using the interest rate credited to the underlying policies 
the egms are based on actuarially determined projections of future premium receipts  mortality  surrenders  operating expenses  changes in insurance liabilities  investment yields on the assets retained to support the policy liabilities and other factors 
these projections take into account all factors known or expected by management 
the actual gross margins may vary from expected levels due to differences in renewal premium  investment spread  investment gains or losses  mortality and morbidity costs and other factors 
investment portfolio general we maintain a diversified portfolio of investments which is supervised by an experienced in house staff of investment professionals 
sophisticated asset liability management techniques are employed in order to achieve competitive yields  while maintaining risk at acceptable levels 
the asset portfolio is segmented by liability type  with tailored investment strategies for specific product lines 
investment policies and significant individual investments are subject to approval by the board of directors and are overseen by the investment and risk management committee of our board of directors 
management regularly monitors individual assets and asset groups  in addition to monitoring the overall asset mix 
in addition  the investment and risk management committee review investment guidelines and monitor internal controls 
investment strategy our investment philosophy is to employ an integrated asset liability management approach with separate investment portfolios for specific product lines  such as traditional life  universal life  equity indexed life  traditional annuities  equity indexed annuities  variable annuities and funding agreements to generate attractive risk adjusted returns on capital 
essential to this philosophy is coordinating investments in the investment portfolio with product strategies  focusing on risk adjusted returns and identifying and evaluating associated business risks 
investment strategies have been established based on the specific characteristics of each product line 
the portfolio investment strategies establish asset duration  quality and other guidelines 
analytical systems are utilized to establish an optimal asset mix for each line of business 
we seek to manage the asset liability mismatch and the associated interest rate risk through active management of the investment portfolio 
financial  actuarial  investment  product development and product marketing professionals work together 
table of contents throughout the product development  introduction and management phases to jointly develop and implement product features  initial and renewal crediting strategies  and investment strategies based on extensive modeling of a variety of factors under a number of interest rate scenarios

table of contents derivatives interest rate swaps and options are primarily used to reduce exposure to changes in interest rates and to manage duration mismatches 
call options are primarily used to hedge equity indexed products 
credit default swaps are coupled with a bond to synthetically create an investment cheaper than the equivalent instrument traded in the cash market 
although we are subject to the risk that counterparties will fail to perform  credit standings of counterparties are monitored regularly 
we only enter into transactions with highly rated counterparties 
we are also subject to the risk associated with changes in the value of contracts 
however  such adverse changes in value generally are offset by changes in the value of the items being hedged 
the notional principal amounts of the swaps and options  which represent the extent of our involvement in such contracts but not the risk of loss  at december   amounted to  million

effective october   we adopted dig issue b and effective january   we adopted sfas see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the impact of adopting both accounting pronouncements 
mortgage loans as of december   mortgage loans in the investment portfolio were million  or of the aggregate carrying value of invested assets 
as of december   commercial mortgage loans and residential mortgage loans comprised and  respectively  of total mortgage loans 
commercial mortgage loans consist primarily of fixed rate mortgage loans 
as of december   we held individual commercial mortgage loans with an average balance of million 
as of december   four loans in the loan portfolio with a carrying value of million were classified as delinquent and no loans were in foreclosure 
as of the same date  only two loans with a carrying value aggregating million were classified as restructured 
during  we had one foreclosure 
other we participate in a securities lending program whereby certain fixed maturity securities from the investment portfolio are loaned to other institutions for a short period of time 
we receive a fee in exchange for the loan of securities and require initial collateral equal to percent of the market value of the loaned securities to be separately maintained 
securities with a market value of million were on loan under the program and the company has cash collateral under its control of million at december  there were no securities on loan at december  we also may enter into securities borrowing arrangements from time to time 
at december  and  there were no securities borrowed 
we held million of policy loans on individual insurance products as of december  policy loans are permitted to the extent of a policy s contractual limits and are fully collateralized by policy cash values 
as of december   we held equity securities of million of which the largest holding was federal home loan bank common stock totaling million 
we held million of other invested assets including short term investments and real estate on december  other invested assets consist primarily of our ameritas joint venture investment  various other joint ventures and limited partnership investments and derivatives 
structured securities arrangements we have utilized a limited number of structured finance arrangements 
the structures primarily consisted of interests in collateralized bond obligations and special purpose entities with principal protected limited partnership interests 
neither amerus nor any management members had operating control or management 
table of contents oversight of the entities and accordingly the entities were not consolidated but rather accounted for as available for sale debt securities or equity method investments 
in addition  we did not have any continued obligation or commitment to provide additional financing to the entities 
at december   approximately million of such structured finance investments were included in invested assets 
these structured securities were liquidated during we hold investments in indexed debt instruments idis in which the principal is initially partially defeased by an obligation of a third party financial institution institution collateralized by us treasuries which will accrete to of the original principal amount of the idis at maturity 
the balance of the principal amount due at maturity is subject to a dynamic defeasance mechanism  which should provide a return of the initial investment 
the instruments issued by the institutions are linked to the performance of a hedge fund or fund of funds 
the annual income on these investments will be equal to the quarterly distribution of the hedge fund or fund of funds plus the change in the present value of anticipated distributions to be received at maturity and will be included in net investment income 
over the life of the idis  the income will be a function of the cumulative performance of the linked hedge fund or fund of funds and the return on any defeased portion of the investment 
the quarterly distribution paid  if any  reduces the amount of future participation in the performance of the linked hedge fund or fund of funds 
at maturity  the company will take delivery of the referenced hedge fund interests and cash or us treasuries equal to the portion of the instruments that have been defeased  the total of which should equal or exceed the instruments principal amount 
the investment purpose of these instruments is to enable the company to obtain the return as if they had invested in hedge funds or fund of funds with dynamic principal protection 
the instruments as of december  carried an a rating or better by fitch 
the carrying value of idis was million at december  impairments our evaluation of other than temporary impairment otti for fixed income securities follows a three step process of screen and identify  assess and document  recommend and approve 
in identifying potential otti s  we screen for all securities that have a fair value less than of amortized cost 
in addition  we monitor securities for general credit issues that have been identified and included on a watch list which may result in the potential impairment list including other securities that have a fair value at or greater than of amortized cost 
for asset backed securities  the guidance of eitf is followed which requires an impairment loss if the fair value of the security is less than amortized costs and there is an adverse change in estimated cash flows from the cash flows previously projected 
the list of securities identified is subject to a formal assessment to determine if an impairment is other than temporary 
management makes certain assumptions or judgments in its assessment of potentially impaired securities including but not limited to industry characteristics and trends  company to industry profile  quality of management financial conditions and trends including strength of balance sheet and financial liquidity significant events affecting the company and or industry viability of the business model incorporating an evaluation of default probability and associated recoverable value length of time the fair value was below of amortized cost ability and intent to retain the investment to maturity or for a sufficient period of time for it to recover if the determination is that the security is otti  it is written down to fair value 
this is reviewed and approved by senior management 
the difference between amortized cost and fair value is charged to net income 
when actively traded market prices are not available  fair values are determined using present value or other standard valuation techniques such as earnings multiples and asset valuations 
the fair value 
table of contents determinations are made at a specific point in time based on then available market information and judgments about the financial instruments 
factors considered in determining fair value include coupon rate  term  collateral if any  industry sector outlook  credit rating  expectations regarding going concern status  timing and amounts of expected future cash flows among other factors 
there are risks and uncertainties inherent in the process of monitoring impairments and determining if an impairment is otti 
risks may include the credit characteristics change affecting the creditor s ability to meet all of its contractual obligations  the economic outlook may be worse than expected or impact the credit more than anticipated  accuracy of information provided by issuers could affect valuations  and new information may change our intent to hold the security to maturity 
any of these items could result in a charge to net income in the future

these securities included underlying holdings that provided for a return of principal through maturity of zero coupon bonds from a highly rated issuer or a principal guarantee from a highly rated company 
these securities along with the securities in the above listing of unrealized losses did not meet the criteria as described in our other than temporary process for impairment determination 
as a result  there was no realized loss for these securities 
unrealized gains or losses may not represent future gains or losses that will be realized 
these unrealized gains or losses are subject to fluctuation  reflective of such things as volatile financial markets  interest rate movements  credit spread changes and sale decisions

this may include required exposure reductions due to internal credit limits  total rate of return strategies  capital reserve objectives  asset allocation decisions and hedging activities 
effects of inflation and interest rate changes management does not believe that inflation has had a material effect on the consolidated results of operations 
interest rate changes may have temporary effects on the sale and profitability of the protection products and accumulation products offered 
for example  if interest rates rise  competing investments such as 
table of contents annuities or life insurance products offered by competitors  certificates of deposit  mutual funds  and similar instruments may become more attractive to potential purchasers of our products until we increase the interest rate credited to owners of our protection products and accumulation products 
in contrast  as interest rates fall  we attempt to adjust credited rates to compensate for the corresponding decline in reinvestment rates 
we monitor interest rates and sell annuities and life insurance policies that permit flexibility to make interest rate changes as part of management of interest spreads 
however  the profitability of our products is based upon persistency  mortality and expenses  as well as interest rate spreads 
we manage our investment portfolio in part to reduce exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
in general  the market value of our fixed maturity portfolio increases or decreases in an inverse relationship with fluctuations in interest rates  and net investment income increases or decreases in a direct relationship with interest rate changes 
we have developed an asset liability management approach with separate investment portfolios for major product lines such as traditional life  universal life  equity indexed life  traditional annuities  equity indexed annuities  variable annuities and funding agreements 
investment strategies have been established based on the specific characteristics of each product line 
the portfolio investment strategies establish asset duration  quality and other guidelines 
analytical systems are utilized to establish an optimal asset mix for each line of business 
we seek to manage the asset liability mismatch and the associated interest rate risk through active management of the investment portfolio 
financial  actuarial  investment  product development and product marketing professionals work together throughout the product development  introduction and management phases to jointly develop and implement product features  initial and renewal crediting strategies  and investment strategies based on extensive modeling of a variety of factors under a number of interest rate scenarios 
in force reserves and the assets allocated to each segment are modeled on a regular basis to analyze projected cash flows under a variety of economic scenarios 
the result of this modeling is used to modify asset allocation  investment portfolio duration and renewal crediting strategies 
we invest in derivatives to hedge against the effects of interest rate fluctuations or to hedge growth in policyowner liabilities for certain life and annuity products and funding agreements 
for a further discussion and disclosure of the nature and extent of the use of derivatives  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
federal income tax matters generally  amerus group and our non life subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return 
the life insurance subsidiaries file separate federal income tax returns  except for ilic and bankers life which together file a consolidated tax return beginning in the separate return method is used to compute the provision for allocating federal income taxes 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences among the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws 
emerging accounting matters sfas in july  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas provides for costs to exit an activity or dispose of long lived assets to be recorded when they are incurred and are to be measured at fair value 
under previous accounting guidance  a liability for an exit cost was recognized at the date of the commitment to an exit plan 
sfas is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  and its adoption had no impact on net income or stockholders equity as of or for the years ended december  and sfas in december  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
sfas amends sfas  accounting for stock 
table of contents based compensation  and provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas requires more prominent and more frequent disclosures in financial statements about the effects of stock based compensation 
as of december   we continue to account for employee stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method provided under sfas and sfas the disclosure requirements of both standards have been provided in note to the consolidated financial statements 
sfas in april  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas  amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas is intended to provide more consistent reporting of contracts as either freestanding derivative instruments subject to sfas in its entirety  or as hybrid instruments with debt host contracts and embedded derivative features 
sfas incorporates decisions previously made by the derivatives implementation group  changes in financial instruments resulting from other projects  and deliberations in connection with issues raised in the application of the definition of a derivative and it does not amend the definition of a derivative 
the provisions of sfas are effective for contracts entered into or modified after june   except for the codification of previous derivative decisions which were already effective and continue to be applied in accordance with their respective effective dates 
sfas had no impact on net income or stockholders equity as of or for the year ended december  sfas in may  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas  accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures freestanding financial instruments as liabilities or equity and was generally effective at the beginning of the first interim period after june  a financial accounting standards board staff position has deferred the application of various provisions of sfas for specified mandatorily redeemable non controlling interests in consolidated limited life entities 
the amerus capital i capital securities were issued through a wholly owned subsidiary trust and are mandatorily redeemable securities which are carried as notes payable on the consolidated balance sheet with interest expense recorded in the consolidated statement of income 
the adoption of sfas did not have any effect on the consolidated financial statements 
fin in november  the financial accounting standards board issued fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  or fin fin clarifies disclosure and recognition and measurement requirements related to certain guarantees 
the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements issued after december  and the recognition and measurement requirements are effective on a prospective basis for guarantees issued or modified after december  adoption of fin in did not have an effect on net income or stockholders equity 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for disclosures related to our guarantees 
fin in january  the financial accounting standards board issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb  or fin fin provides guidance to identify variable interest entities  or vies  and their consolidation by a primary beneficiary 
a vie is defined as an entity in which either the equity investors  if any  do not have a controlling financial interest  or the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity s activities without receiving additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
an enterprise whose investment in a vie absorbs the majority of the vie s expected losses or receives a majority of its expected residual returns is considered a primary beneficiary  although not all vies will have a primary beneficiary 
fin requires primary 
table of contents beneficiaries to consolidate vies in their financial statements and also requires additional disclosures for enterprises which are not primary beneficiaries but which have a significant variable interest in a vie 
the provisions of fin are effective immediately for vies created after january  and is to be applied in the first interim period beginning after june  for interests in vies acquired before february  the additional disclosure is required for financial statements issued after january  at december   we held interests in structured securities arrangements which met the definition of vies  however  most of the interests were sold prior to june  we would have been considered the primary beneficiary for several of those structured securities  which if consolidated at december   would have resulted in an increase in total assets of million  an increase in total liabilities of million and an increase in total stockholders equity of million 
at december   an investment in a limited partnership  for which we provide indirect management functions  has been consolidated rather than carried as an equity method investment  as provided by fin  resulting in an increase in total assets and total liabilities of million and no change in stockholders equity or net income 
in addition  amerus capital i  a previously consolidated subsidiary which has issued trust preferred securities  was deconsolidated in as amerus group co 
is not considered the primary beneficiary under fin deconsolidation of amerus capital i resulted in an increase of other assets and notes payable of million and no change in stockholders equity or net income 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for disclosures and additional information related to our vie interests 
sfas implementation embedded derivatives the financial accounting standards board s derivatives implementation group issued sfas implementation issue no 
b  embedded derivatives bifurcation of a debt instrument that incorporates both interest rate risk and credit risk exposures that are unrelated or only partially related to the creditworthiness of the issuer of that instrument  or dig issue b dig issue applies to modified coinsurance and coinsurance with funds withheld arrangements where interest is determined by reference to a pool of fixed maturity assets or a total return debt index 
such arrangements in which funds are withheld by the ceding insurer cause the reinsurer to recognize a receivable from the ceding insurer as well as a liability representing reserves for the insurance coverage assumed under the reinsurance arrangements 
the terms of the reinsurer s receivable provide for the future payment of principal plus a rate of return on either its general account assets or a specified block of those assets which is typically composed of fixed rate debt securities 
dig issue b considers the reinsurer s receivable from the ceding company to contain an embedded derivative that must be bifurcated and accounted for separately under sfas we adopted dig issue b on october   which included the reclassification of certain securities supporting the products being reinsured from available for sale to trading 
the net cumulative effect of the change in accounting for dig issue b was a charge to net income of million after income taxes and a reduction in accumulated other comprehensive income for the reclassification of securities from available for sale to held for trading amounting to million after income taxes 
sop in july  the accounting standards executive committee of the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position  accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises for certain non traditional long duration insurance contracts and for separate accounts 
sop provides interpretive guidance on separate account presentation and valuation  accounting recognition for sales inducements  and classification and valuation of long duration contract liabilities 
the provisions of sop are effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of sop will not have a material effect on net income or stockholders equity in item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the main objectives in managing our investment portfolios and our insurance subsidiaries are to maximize investment income and total investment returns while minimizing credit risks in order to provide maximum support to the insurance underwriting operations 
investment strategies are developed based on 
table of contents many factors including asset liability management  regulatory requirements  fluctuations in interest rates and consideration of other market risks 
investment decisions are centrally managed by investment professionals based on guidelines established by management and approved by the boards of directors 
market risk represents the potential for loss due to adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments 
the market risks related to our financial instruments primarily relate to the investment portfolio  which exposes us to risks related to interest rates  credit quality and prepayment variation 
analytical tools and monitoring systems are in place to assess each of these elements of market risk 
interest rate risk is the price sensitivity of a fixed income security to changes in interest rates 
management views these potential changes in price within the overall context of asset and liability management 
actuarial professionals estimate the payout pattern of our liabilities  primarily lapses  to determine duration  which is the present value of the fixed income investment portfolios after consideration of the duration of these liabilities and other factors  which management believes mitigates the overall effect of interest rate risk 
for variable and equity indexed products  profitability on the portion of the policyowner s account balance invested in the fixed general account option  if any  is also affected by the spreads between interest yields on investments and rates credited to the policies 
for the variable products  the policyholder assumes essentially all the investment earnings risk for the portion of the account balance invested in the separate accounts 
for the equity indexed products  we purchase primarily call options that are designed to match the return owed to contract holders who elect to participate in one or more market indices 
profitability on the portion of the equity indexed products tied to market indices is significantly impacted by the spread on interest earned on investments and the sum of the cost of underlying call options purchased to match the returns owed to contract holders and the minimum interest guarantees owed to the contract holder  if any 
profitability on the equity indexed products is also impacted by changes in the fair value of the embedded option which provides the contract holder the right to participate in market index returns after the next anniversary date of the contract 
this impacts profitability as we primarily purchase one year call options to fund the returns owed to the contract holders at the inception of each contract year 
this practice matches with the contract holders rights to switch to different indices on each anniversary date 
the value of the forward starting options embedded in the equity indexed products can fluctuate with changes in assumptions as to future volatility of the market indices  risk free interest rates  market returns and the lives of the contracts 

table of contents the following table provides information about our fixed maturity investments and mortgage loans for both our trading and other than trading portfolios at december  the table presents amortized cost and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
the amortized cost approximates the cash flows of principal amounts in each of the periods 
the cash flows are based on the earlier of the call date or the maturity date or  for mortgage backed securities  expected payment patterns 
actual cash flows could differ from the expected amounts 
expected cash flows expected cash fair thereafter flows value in millions fixed maturity securities available for sale average interest rate fixed maturity securities held for trading purposes average interest rate mortgage loans average interest rate total in accordance with our strategy of minimizing credit quality risk  we consistently invest in high quality marketable securities 
fixed maturity securities are comprised of us treasury  government agency  mortgage backed and corporate securities 
approximately of fixed maturity securities are issued by the us treasury or us government agencies or are rated a or better by moody s  standard and poor s  or the naic 
less than of the bond portfolio is below investment grade 
fixed maturity securities have an average maturity of approximately years 
prepayment risk refers to the changes in prepayment patterns that can either shorten or lengthen the expected timing of the principal repayments and thus the average life and the effective yield of a security 
such risk exists primarily within the portfolio of mortgage backed securities 
management monitors such risk regularly 
we invest primarily in those classes of mortgage backed securities that have average or lower prepayment risk 
our use of derivatives is generally limited to hedging purposes and has principally consisted of using swaps and options 
these instruments  viewed separately  subject us to varying degrees of market and credit risk 
however when used for hedging  the expectation is that these instruments would reduce overall market risk 
credit risk arises from the possibility that counterparties may fail to perform under the terms of the contracts 
see note of the consolidated financial statements for additional information about our derivative positions 
equity price risk is the potential loss arising from changes in the value of equity securities 
in general  equities have more year to year price variability than intermediate term grade bonds 
however  returns over longer time frames have been consistently higher 
all of the above risks are monitored on an ongoing basis 
a combination of in house systems and proprietary models and externally licensed software are used to analyze individual securities as well as each portfolio 
these tools provide the portfolio managers with information to assist them in the evaluation of the market risks of the portfolio
