general we are a leading provider of health information solutions that add value to our pharmacy  hospital  physician  pharmaceutical manufacturer and payer customer groups 

table of contents healthcare market the us government estimates that healthcare spending in the united states will reach trillion in  up from trillion in  and that approximately of total healthcare expenditures in was spent on administrative overhead 
we believe that we play an important role in providing automation  transaction processing and information solutions to improve the efficiency and efficacy of healthcare 
we believe the integrated services we offer to the healthcare industry place us strategically in the center of a very dynamic marketplace 
because of our position  we manage healthcare related information from the point of patient contact through the point of payment  and maintain the high standards required for patient confidentiality 
there is a growing need in healthcare for technology based services and comprehensive information solutions 
we believe that our integrated solutions provide information and services useful in reducing administrative and other related healthcare costs and expenses and enhancing the quality of care 
additionally  we believe an aging population is driving demand for improved information technology services relating to the healthcare industry 
because a high percentage of healthcare transactions are still handled using manual  paper based methods  or are not being consistently processed  we believe that the healthcare industry is one of the largest opportunities for growth in providing integrated information solutions 
our solutions provide the tools to help providers and payers reduce administrative expense  while at the same time providing a robust source for statistical and analytical information required by our customers 
in recent years  the healthcare industry  including the healthcare financing and reimbursement system  has changed significantly in an effort to reduce costs 
these changes include increased use of managed care  cuts in medicare and medicaid payment and reimbursement levels  consolidation of pharmaceutical and medical surgical supply distributors  and the development of large  sophisticated purchasing groups 
we expect the healthcare industry to continue to change significantly in the future 
some of these changes could have a material  negative impact on our revenue and or expenses 
ndchealth market position we are a leading provider of healthcare claims transaction processing in terms of the number of electronic transactions processed and of related value added services for pharmacies  hospitals and physicians 
we are also a leading provider of market research information for pharmaceutical manufacturers based on the number of customers and the number of pharmaceutical detail sales representatives compensated based on our data products 
we processed over billion electronic healthcare transactions in fiscal we provide information services to more than pharmaceutical manufacturers in the united states 
we have leading market positions in all of our network services and systems solutions markets and believe that we are the only comprehensive provider of both transaction processing services and market research information in the healthcare industry 
our involvement in both of these markets positions us to provide integrated information solutions to our customers 
we believe that we will benefit from increasing penetration of electronic claims processing in the healthcare industry  from increasing utilization of prescription pharmaceuticals by a growing elderly population  and from the pharmaceutical industry s growing demand for access to more granular information and solutions to support their sales  marketing and operational strategies 
business position and strategy our strategy starts with the fundamental transaction in healthcare s revenue cycle the submission of claims from providers to third party payers 
we estimate that we process approximately of the electronic healthcare claims in the united states 
our revenue increases as we gain market share and provide advanced edit processing and other value added products and services to the claims in real time to 
table of contents add significant customer value 
we are generally able to price incrementally for these additional products and services in addition to the pricing for the base claim 
further  due to an aging population and increasing automation in healthcare  claims volume should grow  also generally increasing revenue 
from our network  where authorized by our customers  we capture the claim and related transaction information  combine that information with data we purchase  and create information solutions for pharmaceutical manufacturers and providers 
our information strategy is to continue aggregating and integrating data from our network and purchased from other sources to create unique new products that build additional streams of revenue and expand margins 
we provide products and services to five major areas of the healthcare industry pharmacies retail  mail order  internet based and specialty  hospitals  physicians  pharmaceutical manufacturers  and third party payers 
by aggregating and integrating data from the three provider markets  we increasingly create unique business insights for pharmaceutical manufacturers 
as healthcare evolves  our goal is to also expand our customer base to include payers  employers and consumers while reducing the effective cost per unit of data 
we have a number of new initiatives underway to allow us opportunities to realize the still very large untapped potential for our solutions in our existing markets 
while not our primary focus  situations may come to our attention in which an acquisition would complement both objectives of strengthening the balance sheet and executing our strategy 
in such events  we would expect to pursue such an opportunity 
the key elements to our strategy include growing claims volume as healthcare grows and through gains in market share  increasing revenue per claim through greater penetration of value added transaction services with customers  taking full advantage of our extensive claims processing resources in our information management business and to be well positioned for a rebound in the pharmaceutical manufacturing industry  and continuing to invest in new products and services  focusing on key development initiatives such as completing development of our techrx integrated retail solutions for national chain pharmacies  and mail order and managed care systems platforms  and building and selling our unique ndc intelligent health repository  a diagnosis to drug linked database containing longitudinal data from all of healthcare 
in combination with our ability to control operational and administrative costs  we believe this strategy  properly executed  will allow us to accelerate future revenue growth  improve profitability and generate significant cash flow during fiscal  allowing us to continue to reduce our debt and interest expense 
network services and systems segment our network services and systems segment enables an electronic exchange of complex healthcare claims data between providers and payers  increasing efficiency and quality of care while decreasing costs 
we provide our customers with connectivity to over  payers 
in conjunction with claims transmissions  we provide over value added transaction services and claims edits that help providers minimize unpaid claims  enhance the accuracy of revenue from submitted claims  decrease receivable days 
table of contents outstanding and improve labor efficiency 
these transaction services include eligibility verification  remittance advice  referral authorization  and prescription ordering and refill authorization  among others 
we also license point of service software systems to pharmacies and physicians that integrate our electronic transactions services with standard business management tools 
these systems drive transaction volume on our network while streamlining provider workflow  improving our customers cash flow and providing real time information to facilitate efficient business management 
we believe that we have a leading position in all of our network services and systems markets 
an increasing concentration of pharmacy prescriptions are occurring within large pharmacy and grocery chains  such as albertsons  cvs  walgreen and wal mart 
while we have been very successful in growing our pharmacy transaction processing market share  we are generally paid a lower per transaction fee from large pharmacy chains  versus smaller regional and independent pharmacies  due to transaction volume based rate structures 
as a result  changes in volume mix can impact average revenue per claim and the rate of increase 
in addition  a greater portion of total prescriptions are being filled by mail order pharmacies  with which we generally have less opportunity to provide services and generate revenue than with retail pharmacy operators  limiting the prescription volume growth at retail pharmacies 
if this trend continues  it may have a negative impact on our pharmacy services revenue and profit 
we generate network services revenue from providers increasingly on a per transaction basis 
historically  we have generated hospital  pharmacy and physician systems revenue through the sale of software licenses  upgrades and recurring maintenance and support fees 
we are increasingly generating hospital and pharmacy systems revenue on a recurring basis through transaction based and monthly fee per location pricing 
our ndchealth intelligent network is the cornerstone of our network services and systems segment  and consists of three communications networks that transmit claims and other transaction data  as well as three data support facilities 
the data support facilities perform a variety of functions  such as aggregating incoming data from the communications networks  processing the data to conform each claim submission to the particular payer s format  and performing pre and post submission claim edits 
claim edits are based on predetermined criteria and return informational messages to providers that are designed to help them avoid rejected claims and resubmissions  enhance the accuracy of the reimbursement they receive from payers and minimize costs 
in instances in which we are not prohibited from utilizing the data  de identified transaction data derived from our intelligent network enhances the pharmaceutical market research products that we provide to pharmaceutical manufacturers through our information management segment 
our pharmacy  hospital  and physician systems are the entry and exit points for information to and from our ndchealth intelligent network 
through our network  we are partnering with our customers to improve efficiency and effectiveness in healthcare 
some examples include real time eligibility verification  drug formulary and inventory management  and facilitation of prompt payment for products and services 
the acquisition of techrx in fiscal strengthened our position in the point of service prescription fulfillment area  and our new t rex one line of products is being sold to customers as a transaction based solution to create a recurring revenue stream 
t rex one is designed to automate the prescription fulfillment process and provide connectivity 
included in the solutions package are third party claims transmissions via the ndchealth intelligent network  pre and post edit transaction services  software and upgrades  centralized prescriber and product pricing data  automated data backup and storage  electronic prescription capability  digital signature capture  pos interface and a variety of reports 
the enterprise version of t rex one  designed for national and larger regional chains  will address the challenges facing the pharmacy industry today dramatic growth in prescription volume  a pronounced pharmacist shortage  lower profit margins on prescriptions  increased patient demand for service  and increased competition for customers 
our software is designed to allow a pharmacy to fill more prescriptions with the same number of pharmacists  integrate all pharmacy applications into one central system with a single source of customer files  and provide real time inventory management to increase turns 

table of contents while we are confident in the functionality and market demand of our new pharmacy systems  we cannot predict the exact time and cost to complete development of our t rex enterprise and mail order offerings  or the rate of market acceptance  customer installation  and revenue growth which will result 
we also offer claims processing for hospitals  as well as providing claims editing to increase the acceptance rate by payers of hospital claims and assist hospital management in improving cash flow and reducing outstanding accounts receivable 
ndc epremis  our platform for revenue cycle management launched in fiscal  incorporates new technology  expands functional attributes and creates the base upon which new applications can be built 
using new application internet technology  this offering allows us to upgrade our existing base of over  hospital customers and add new large hospitals and provides the opportunity to penetrate the smaller hospital market 
similar to our pharmacy offerings  the new workflow features of ndc epremis permit multiple people to work with claims simultaneously  yielding greater efficiency and better workload balancing 
ndc epremis can also be integrated into hospital information systems provided by various major companies to further extend our market reach 
while we anticipate accelerating market acceptance for ndc epremis  we need to continue to successfully execute on our timing of delivery and quality of our customer implementations to maintain our sales momentum and achieve planned revenue growth 
given the competitiveness and price sensitivity within the hospital marketplace  any consolidation or pricing pressure could impact our revenue growth and profitability related to our hospital customer group 
we provide practice management software for physicians and have created a niche in the one to three physician practice group market 
we have sold our solutions to more than  medical practices 
physician s offices utilize our software and systems to handle patient scheduling and billing  and to manage accounts receivables 
because of the relative lack of automation in small physician offices  we believe these customers represent a unique opportunity for expanded electronic claims processing services 
this electronic connection also assists our customers in improving their cash flow and provides an important communication channel between the payer and the physician 
we have connected systems for approximately  physicians to a third party on line network to process claims using an electronic data interchange edi network 
we sell our physician software  systems and services primarily to value added resellers vars who then sell into physician practices 
the vars success in selling their inventory of our products and the strength of our relationships with our vars following a period in which we have stopped offering credit terms on sales to our vars  could be a primary driver to the number of new and upgraded products they purchase from us in the future 
in addition  the physician market has been slow to adopt technology solutions because of the cost  the multitude of small suppliers  and the perceived lack of measurable financial benefits 
these factors could negatively impact our revenue from our physician customer group 
the key growth drivers in the network services and systems segment are further penetration of our provider customer base with additional value added transaction services to grow our revenue per claim  continued growth in claims  introduction of new product and service offerings  roll out and market acceptance of new system technology platforms in pharmacy and hospital with a recurring revenue pricing model  and continued gains in market share 

table of contents information management segment pharmaceutical companies require data on drug sales volumes  physician prescribing patterns and payer drug cost management activity to better analyze their markets  effectively deploy marketing resources and compensate their sales forces 
we purchase prescription drug data from pharmacies  wholesalers  specialty drug companies and others  and also generate data from our intelligent network 
we use this data to provide our pharmaceutical company customers with proprietary market analysis tools 
we also provide related consulting services to customers 
we believe that we have the number two market position in this market in the united states 
our information management revenue has remained relatively weak  due to factors including a cyclically low demand for information in the us pharmaceutical industry as new product introductions have declined  numerous branded drugs have lost patent protection  some large pharmaceutical manufacturers have been acquired  and pharmaceutical manufacturers continue to tightly constrain discretionary spending 
we will continue to invest in and manage the quality and cost effectiveness of our current applications 
for example  our emerging suite of insight and impact solutions provide new ways for our customers to market their products  target physicians and evaluate the results of their business decisions  and clearly differentiate ndchealth and broaden our market opportunity 
we believe the pharmaceutical industry is looking for innovative ways to utilize new solutions to increase sales efficiency and revenue growth 
to address this need  we are building next generation information products by combining our network connectivity and the arclight data we acquire through our exclusive agreement to offer a broader database and more accurate data at a granular level for compensation and targeting purposes 
we expect to be positioned to offer the largest hipaa compliant  privacy protected diagnosis to drug linked database of information and connectivity to help change the way pharmaceutical manufacturers do business 
the number of new drugs approved by the food and drug administration fda is expected to accelerate to approximately per year in each of  and  according to some industry estimates 
as a result  we believe our customers should begin to increase their spending as they roll out new drugs that are currently in the fda review process 
as pharmaceutical manufacturers begin to accelerate the introduction of new drugs  we believe that discretionary spending will increase  supporting our revenue growth 
our top five information management customers  in aggregate  comprise more than of our information management segment revenue and any consolidation of customers or significantly lower spending from our largest customers could have an adverse impact on our business and financial results 
in addition  the majority of our contracts with pharmaceutical manufacturers extend for two to three years 
while we signed contract renewals or extensions with our largest customers during fiscal  competitive pricing pressure  a weak discretionary spending environment or any change in our contract terms and pricing could cause us to lose significant revenue 
our costs to purchase data also continue to increase  and our ability to accelerate revenue growth faster than expenses is an important driver of profit expansion in this segment 
pharmacy benefit services segment our pharmacy benefit services segment provides our customers with tools  resources and data that allow them to manage their pharmacy benefit plans more efficiently 
among the services provided are claims processing and adjudication  consulting on clinical guidelines  formulary and rebate management  pharmacy network development and administration  and various reporting services 
this segment s revenue and cost of service includes the underlying cost of the prescription drug benefit being administered  thereby providing a very low contribution margin 
while we expect to experience significant pharmacy benefit services revenue growth in fiscal due to our expansion into administrative services and a high percentage of already contracted revenue  there are certain factors that could impact our long term growth in this segment 
pharmacy 
table of contents benefit administration providers offer services similar to pharmacy benefit managers but with a different pricing model to their customers that is not yet widely accepted 
further  the evolution of the medicare drug benefit plan as well as the potential for major health plans to move their outsourced pharmacy benefit services to be handled by in house staff present both challenges and potential opportunities in growing revenue in this segment 
business focus in order to narrow our focus on the best near term opportunities for growth and profit in our network services and systems and information management segments and eliminate net losses in europe  our board of directors authorized the disposition of our european businesses in germany and the united kingdom  which are now classified as discontinued operations 
revenue from discontinued operations was million in fiscal and million in fiscal losses from discontinued operations were million in fiscal and million in fiscal in recording these businesses as discontinued operations  we incurred an after tax charge of million or per diluted share to write down the carrying value of our equity investment in our european joint venture 
in addition  we are also de emphasizing our efforts in new physician electronic prescribing activities 
we will continue to leverage our market leadership to help connect pharmacies to physician interface providers  a profitable component of e prescribing for us today 
we believe this is the portion of e prescribing where currently we bring the greatest strength  and we will concentrate our physician market efforts on our high margin systems and edi businesses 
due to this strategic decision  we incurred a non cash charge of million  or per diluted share  to write down our investment in an e prescribing company 
government regulation the healthcare industry is highly regulated and is subject to changing political  regulatory and other influences 
forced changes through legislation can be disruptive to business processes and strategies  but at the same time can provide opportunities for us  given our scale  market presence  knowledge base and information solutions scope 
for example  we expect the drug benefit program under the medicare reform act of to provide us with more transaction processing and editing opportunities  as well as create a need for new insights from our analytical offerings for both pharmaceutical manufacturers and pharmacies 
under the health insurance portability and accountability act of  or hipaa  congress required the adoption of rules to establish standards and requirements for the electronic transmission of certain health information 
rules include standards for electronic transactions  published august   standards for privacy of individually identifiable health information  published december   standards for unique employer identifiers  published may   and standards for the security of electronic health information  published february  these rules generally restrict the use and disclosure  and mandate security  of personally identifiable health information 
the hipaa rules apply to healthcare providers  health plans  and healthcare clearinghouses as well as  in certain instances  those who provide services on behalf of these entities which involve the receipt or disclosure of health information 
certain of our operations are subject to the hipaa rules 
continued compliance with these final rules could be costly and require complex changes in our systems as well as the systems of our customers 
all of our products are designed to be compliant with hipaa regulations 
however  additional federal or state legislation relative to patient privacy or utilization of physician prescribing information could adversely affect the scope of our informatics offerings 
as we become aware of changes  we intend to incorporate possibilities into strategy alternatives and be prepared to capitalize on opportunities 

table of contents these factors affect the purchasing practices and operation of healthcare organizations 
federal and state legislatures and agencies periodically consider programs to reform or revise the us healthcare system 
these programs may contain proposals to increase governmental involvement in healthcare  lower reimbursement rates  restrict availability or use of data  or otherwise change the environment in which healthcare industry participants operate 
we are unable to predict future proposals with any certainty or to predict the effect they would have on our business 
other state and federal statutes and regulations governing transmission of healthcare information may affect our operations 
for example  medicaid rules require some processing services and eligibility verification to be maintained as separate and distinct operations 
we carefully review our practices in an effort to ensure that we are in compliance with all applicable state and federal laws 
these laws  however  are complex and changing  and the courts and other governmental authorities may take positions that are inconsistent with our practices thereby increasing our costs of complying or otherwise adversely affecting our operations 
federal and state laws govern patient referrals  physician financial relationships and inducements to beneficiaries of federal healthcare programs 
the federal anti kickback law prohibits any person or entity from offering  paying  soliciting or receiving anything of value  directly or indirectly  for the referral of patients covered by medicare  medicaid and other federal healthcare programs or the leasing  purchasing  ordering or arranging for  or recommending the lease  purchase  order or arrangement of  any item  good  facility or service covered by these programs 
the anti kickback law is broad and may apply to some of our activities or our relationships with our customers or business partners 
penalties for violating the anti kickback law include imprisonment  fines and exclusion from participating  directly or indirectly  in medicare  medicaid and other federal healthcare programs 
many states have similar anti kickback laws that are not necessarily limited to items or services for which payment is made by a federal healthcare program 
we carefully review our practices in an effort to ensure that we comply with all applicable laws 
however  the laws in this area are both broad and vague and it is often difficult or impossible to determine precisely how the laws will be applied 
any determination by a state or federal regulatory agency that any of our practices violate any of these laws could subject us to civil or criminal penalties and require us to change or terminate some portions of our business 
in order to remain competitive and satisfy the requirements and needs of our customers  we must remain informed of and adapt to new regulations governing the transmission  use and processing of personal information in electronic commerce and over the internet 
although many of these regulations may not apply directly to our business  we expect that these regulations and any new laws regulating the solicitation  collection or processing of personal or consumer information could indirectly affect our business 
our efforts to remain competitive and profitable and ensure compliance  and our customers compliance  with these regulations may require the expenditure of significant sums in research and development and investments in new technology and processes and will require significant attention from senior management 
acquisitions and alliances from time to time  we have made acquisitions and investments and entered into strategic alliances in an effort to obtain a competitive advantage or an expanded presence in targeted markets 
we believe that selective acquisitions  investments and strategic alliances are important to our ability to compete effectively 
mckesson omnilink in april  we acquired mckesson corporation s omnilink sm ppe assets and customer base for pharmacy claims processing and editing for approximately million in cash 
in connection with the transaction  we signed an agreement to form a strategic alliance with mckesson s pharmacy systems company that will enhance our offering of value added transactions services to pharmacies 
we will 
table of contents jointly market our ndc pre post editing service solutions to the base of  mckesson pharmacy systems customers 
this asset purchase will allow us to add more than  omnilink store locations to our existing base of more than  pharmacies currently using our ppe services 
cardinal health in may  we entered into a strategic alliance with the pharmaceutical distribution and provider services segment of cardinal health  inc  to market and develop products and services for the healthcare industry jointly 
as part of the alliance  ndchealth editing services under the scriptline brand will continue to be offered to pharmacies exclusively by cardinal health 
the alliance also provides for joint development between us and cardinal health of additional marketing programs  products and services 
we continue to grow scriptline together and are pursuing several new strategic initiatives 
proxymed during july  in exchange for the contribution of the assets of our physician services network  we became an investor in medunite  inc  which offered a nationwide edi based transaction system to connect providers and payers 
on august   the financial advisors to medunite s board of directors advised us that they had evaluated several preliminary proposals related to a recapitalization plan and selected parties with which they intended to proceed with a potential recapitalization or sale transaction 
at that time  the net carrying value of our investment was approximately million  consisting of million in equity  million in convertible debt  and million in promissory notes and accrued interest 
based upon the information received from medunite s financial advisors  as well as an updated evaluation of medunite s results and of capital market conditions  we determined that the fair value of our investment was approximately million  the amount of proceeds that we expected to receive from the recapitalization or sale of medunite 
therefore  in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  we incurred a million non cash charge in fiscal to reduce the carrying value of our equity investment in medunite 
on december   proxymed purchased medunite and in exchange for our equity investment in medunite carried at million  we received two convertible debt issues totaling million from proxymed 
our remaining investment in medunite consisting of million in convertible debt and million in promissory notes and accrued interest  and trade receivables from medunite of million not included in the carrying value of our investment  were restructured into a million year note from proxymed 
in order to determine the appropriate carrying value of the consideration received from proxymed in exchange for our interest in medunite  several factors were considered 
our valuation considered the interest rates of the convertible debt and the new note  the long term nature of the note  our current borrowing rate  and the financial condition of proxymed and their ability to satisfy the terms of the debt and note 
accordingly  during fiscal we recorded charges totaling million related to the loss on the value of this investment and associated costs 
in conjunction with the sale of our interest in medunite to proxymed  we also evaluated other aspects of our medunite relationship 
as part of this evaluation  we identified million of trade receivables that we believe became uncollectible as a result of the change in relationship with medunite 
accordingly  a charge of million is included in restructuring and other charges in fiscal to reserve for these receivables 
in addition  we reserved million of the note receivable from proxymed during fiscal  which was subsequently reversed during the fourth quarter of because of proxymed s positive payment history 
techrx in may  we completed the acquisition of techrx incorporated 
techrx is a leading provider of pharmacy software that automates the prescription fulfillment process  with systems in 
table of contents over of pharmacies in the united states 
techrx systems provide pharmacy customers with an integrated solution for in store operations  centralized processing and connectivity to payers and physicians 
we were formerly a minority shareholder in techrx and  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  entered into an agreement and plan of merger under which we agreed to acquire the remaining stock in a two step transaction 
under the first step in may  we acquired a controlling interest through the purchase of additional common stock and the conversion of non voting convertible preferred stock for an additional investment in techrx common stock of approximately million 
under the second step  which closed in may  we acquired the remaining shares in techrx from minority shareholders for approximately million cash  net 
arclight on december   through an agreement whereby we acquired fixed assets and employees and obtained a seven year exclusive license to certain of its assets  we acquired the continuing operations of arclight  an information management company 
the purchase price included  shares of unregistered ndchealth common stock with a market value as of the date of issuance of million and a five year warrant to purchase an additional  shares of ndchealth common stock at an exercise price of per share with an estimated value as of the date of issuance using the black scholes option pricing model of million 
the assumptions used in estimating the warrant s value were a risk free interest rate of  an expected dividend yield of  an expected life of five years  and expected volatility of 
additionally  the acquisition required the recording of transaction and lease termination costs totaling million and a million receivable for future cash payments from the remaining arclight business to ndchealth relating to a previous agreement between the two parties 
arclight made a transition payment of million to ndchealth at closing 
the transition payment resulted in a reduction in the consideration we paid for arclight s business 
future cash payments from arclight to ndchealth relating to the previous agreement will reduce the net purchase price in subsequent periods 
as a part of the agreement  we will pay arclight royalties on our future sales of products utilizing arclight data and the agreement to use certain data may be extended for three additional years if certain financial and business objectives are met 
if the agreement is extended for an additional three years  arclight will have the option to receive an additional million in either cash or ndchealth common stock 
arclight is an information management company owned by a major wholesale drug distribution company  cardinal health  inc  and a number of major retail pharmacy chains  including albertson s inc  cvs corporation  kmart corporation and wal mart stores  inc for additional information regarding our acquisitions  please see note business acquisitions and investments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
global payments on january   we completed the spin off of global payments  inc  our former payment services business 
because of the nature of certain systems we shared with global payments  prior to the spin off  we jointly determined that it was in the best interest of both companies for us to continue to provide services to global payments utilizing these systems 
therefore  we entered into a network services agreement whereby we provide transaction processing services for global payments 
global payments reimburses us for these services at a rate that approximates our costs 
the initial term of the agreement ended january  and was extended through september  we are scheduled to receive million annually through september  as a result of this revised agreement 
as part of our spin off of global payments  we received a tax ruling relating to the qualification of the distribution as a tax free distribution within the meaning of section of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
the continuing validity of this tax ruling is subject to certain factual representations and assumptions 
if the distribution were to lose its status as a tax free distribution  we would recognize 
table of contents taxable gain equal to the excess of the fair market value of the global payments common stock distributed to our stockholders over our tax basis in such stock 
in addition  each of our stockholders who received global payments common stock in the distribution would generally be treated as receiving a taxable distribution in an amount equal to the fair market value of such stock 
if the distribution is disqualified as tax free to us because of certain post distribution circumstances  we would recognize taxable gain but the distribution would generally remain tax free to each of our stockholders 
under the tax sharing and indemnification agreement between us and global payments  if the distribution fails to qualify as a tax free distribution because of an acquisition of its stock or assets  or certain acts or failure to act on its part  then global payments would be solely liable for any resulting corporate taxes 
however  if global payments fails to indemnify us  we would be jointly and severally liable for federal income taxes resulting from the distribution being taxable 

table of contents results of operations we operate our business as three fundamental segments network services and systems  information management  and pharmacy benefit services 
network services and systems provides electronic connectivity to our ndchealth intelligent network and system solutions throughout the healthcare industry

table of contents revenue total revenue increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal total revenue increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal an analysis of revenue by segment is discussed below 
network services and systems network services and systems revenue grew million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal network services and systems revenue grew million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal million of the increase from fiscal to fiscal was due to the acquisition of techrx and scriptline with the remaining growth resulting from increased transaction volumes and sales of new products 
revenue growth from fiscal to fiscal was lower than the growth from fiscal to fiscal due to lack of major acquisitions as well as declines in revenue from sale of software and services to our hospital and physician customers 
revenue by customer group in millions vs 
change vs 
change dollars percent dollars percent pharmacy hospital physician other total revenue from pharmacy customers grew million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal due primarily to increased information and analytic product sales to pharmacy and related customers 
while network transactions grew  transaction revenue growth lagged volume growth due to an increasing share of transactions from larger pharmacy chains where pricing is lower than average due to volume rate structures 
pharmacy customer revenue grew million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal due to the acquisition of techrx and scriptline with the remaining growth resulting from increased transaction volumes and sales of new products 
prospectively  we expect to capture more pharmacy prescription claims processing and ppe transaction services volume from independent and small regional chains  where pricing is higher 
while pharmacy system sales have been slower than previously anticipated  we expect the demonstrated performance and financial benefits of our new pharmacy systems will lead to new sales over the next year 
revenue from hospital customers declined million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal due to a transition to our newest revenue cycle management offering  ndc epremis  that resulted in delayed revenue as part of a fee per transaction model and lower non recurring training and support services revenue related to our legacy system product 
ndc epremis continues to experience sales and installation momentum  which should provide a solid platform for revenue growth as the hospital product line transitions to a greater percentage of recurring revenue 
hospital customer group revenue increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal due to increased claims volume 
revenue from the physician customer group decreased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal due to a tightening of credit terms and a change in business practice in selling software to vars generally on a cash basis instead of on credit terms  which led to significantly fewer system sales in the second half of fiscal physician system sales should improve to more normal levels beginning in the second quarter of fiscal as vars begin to purchase new upgrades that will be released beginning in october  which will contain a number of new features including the recent hipaa security requirements 
physician customer group revenue grew million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal due to the inclusion of certain allowances granted to our vars as revenue  increased software product sales  and increased claim revenue 

table of contents revenue from other customer group includes transaction services provided to global payments  inc and a recently outsourced statement printing operation 
revenue for the other customer group decreased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal due to the global payments contract being renewed at a lower rate and a decrease in statement printing revenue 
revenue from other customer group increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal due to growth in the statement printing operation 
information management information management revenue was nearly flat in fiscal compared to fiscal  growing million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this was due to lower revenue from consulting and legacy services in a weak environment for discretionary spending by pharmaceutical manufacturers 
these declines were offset by growth in newer product offerings  which provide increased insight into drug utilization and effectiveness 
renewed growth in this segment should be driven by our emerging information solutions as well as higher anticipated levels of customer strategic sales and marketing spending related to an expanding number of new drug launches expected in calendar and subsequent years 
information management revenue grew million  or to million in fiscal from million in fiscal due to sales of new products and increased sales of existing products

the increase of sg a expense of million in fiscal compared to fiscal was caused by the acquisition and inclusion of techrx and by general growth in the company s business

the severance charges reflect specifically identified executives and employees who were informed of their employment termination during fiscal the exit related costs relate to the closure of two offices and the reduction in size of two offices 
also in the second fiscal quarter of  we wrote off a million note receivable related to a business that was exited in in conjunction with the sale of our interest in medunite to proxymed  we also evaluated other aspects of our medunite relationship

accordingly  a charge of million is included in restructuring and other charges in fiscal to reserve for these receivables 
in addition  we reserved million of the note receivable from proxymed during fiscal  which was subsequently reversed during the fourth quarter of because of the positive payment history of proxymed

in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we borrowed million under a line of credit in order to complete step of the techrx acquisition and in order to purchase scriptline assets 
this amount was outstanding until the time of the refinancing in fiscal referenced above and in note minority interest in earnings losses results from our interest in our consolidated subsidiary engaged in providing pharmacy benefit services and is driven by their profitability 
when this subsidiary is profitable  we are required to share the profits and record a charge 
when this subsidiary is not profitable  we share in the loss and record a benefit 
in fiscal we recorded a benefit of million related to minority interest add back for acquisition related costs at techrx 
early extinguishment of debt was million in fiscal and was for the early payment of a mortgage we held on a building on our corporate campus 
early extinguishment of debt was million in fiscal and was related to the retirement of a credit facility and convertible notes with our refinancing in fiscal during the fourth quarter of  we made the decision to de emphasize our efforts in new physician electronic prescribing activities 
we will continue to leverage our market leadership to help connect pharmacies to physician interface providers  a profitable component of e prescribing for us today 
this is the portion of e prescribing where we currently bring the greatest strength  and intend to concentrate our physician market efforts on our high margin systems and edi businesses 
due to this strategic decision  we incurred a non cash charge of million  or per diluted share  to write down our investment in an e prescribing company 
loss related to investments was in fiscal and million in fiscal on august   the financial advisors to medunite s board of directors shared with us that they had evaluated several preliminary proposals related to a recapitalization plan and selected parties with which they intended to proceed with further evaluation  discussions  and negotiation of a potential recapitalization transaction 
at that time  the net carrying value of our investment was approximately million consisting of million in equity  million in convertible debt  and million in promissory notes and accrued interest 
based upon the information received from medunite s financial advisors  as well as an updated evaluation of medunite s results and of capital market conditions  we determined that the fair value of our investment was approximately million  the amount of proceeds that we expected to receive from the sale of medunite 
therefore  in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 we reduced the carrying value of our equity investment by way of a million non cash charge in fiscal 
table of contents on december   proxymed purchased medunite and in exchange for our equity investment in medunite of million  we received two convertible debt issues totaling million from proxymed 
our remaining investment in medunite consisting of million in convertible debt and million in promissory notes and accrued interest  and trade receivables from medunite of million not included in the carrying value of our investment  were restructured into a million  year note from proxymed 
in order to determine the appropriate carrying value of the consideration received from proxymed in exchange for our interest in medunite  several factors were considered 
our valuation considered the interest rates of the convertible debt and the new note  the long term nature of the note  our current borrowing rate  and the financial condition of proxymed and their ability to satisfy the terms of the debt and note 
accordingly  during fiscal we recorded charges totaling million related to the loss on the value of this investment 
provision for income taxes our estimated continuing effective tax rate in fiscal   and was   and respectively 
the tax rate for fiscal was higher than fiscal due to certain capital losses that were not deductible in fiscal more information on income taxes can be found in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
we expect our effective tax rate to remain in the fiscal level for the next fiscal year 
discontinued operations during fiscal we initiated a review of our european operations to determine alternatives to mitigate losses associated with those operations 
as a result of this review  our board of directors authorized the disposition of our european businesses 
accordingly  our financial statements have been prepared with the net assets and liabilities  results of operations  and cash flows of these operations displayed separately as discontinued operations with all historical financial statements restated to conform to this presentation 
in conjunction with this discontinuance  we recorded an after tax asset write down of million or per diluted share related to our equity investment in a joint venture in europe 
our european businesses consist of our interest in ndchealth gmbh  a german based company  and two businesses in the united kingdom  ndchealth limited and ndchealth holding uk ltd 
our german company was previously reported in our information management segment  while our united kingdom operations were reported as a part of our network services and systems segment

the tax expense for fiscal includes an adjustment to our valuation allowance to fully reserve the deferred tax assets related to the net operating losses nol s from these european businesses 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources payments from our customers are our greatest source of liquidity 
additional sources of liquidity include our credit facility  financing under capital lease arrangements  vendor financing  and issuances of common stock and other instruments 
the cash provided by these sources has a variety of uses 
most importantly  we must pay our employees and vendors for the services and materials they supply 
additional uses include capital equipment  development of additional products  investments in alliances  acquisitions  payment of taxes  payment of dividends  extension of credit to our customers  repayment of debt  and other general funding of our day to day operations 
our operating cash requirements are generally satisfied with customer receipts as we receive a higher level of cash from our customers than we expend for payments of salaries and other recurring operating costs 
excess cash that we generate after satisfying all of our continuing operating requirements is shown on our statement of cash flows as net cash provided by operating activities 
this measure takes into account items such as non cash expenses included in our operating income  cash used to extend credit to our customers  and cash provided by our vendors extending credit to us 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for fiscal  an increase from million in fiscal net income adjusted for non cash items including loss on discontinued operations  restructuring and other charges  early extinguishment of debt charges  loss related to investments  and depreciation and amortization was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal favorable tax treatment of certain items arising from our continuing operations primarily the deductibility of research and development costs and amortization  along with the utilization of nols  had the effect of reducing our net deferred tax asset and our cash tax payments by approximately million 
we expect fiscal tax payments to be about the same due to the continued generation of favorable temporary differences and the utilization of nols 
our net deferred tax asset was further reduced by million for various other items primarily the recording of the valuation allowance on the foreign nols from discontinued operations 
while cash provided by operating activities was negatively impacted by lower net income adjusted for non cash items as discussed above  improvements in working capital provided a benefit of million in fiscal compared to a use of million in fiscal the most significant difference between fiscal and was accrued interest on long term debt 
because interest payments on the million of senior subordinated notes are made on june and december of each year  no interest payment was made in fiscal which provided a benefit of million 
cash payment of this interest was made in the first quarter of fiscal followed by the december payment in the third quarter 
because cash payments in fiscal exceeded interest expense for the same period  accrued interest used million of cash in fiscal other significant differences between fiscal and fiscal are prepaid expenses and other assets  accounts payable and accrued liabilities  and deferred revenue 
collectively  these changes in working capital provided million of cash in fiscal and used million of cash in fiscal changes in working capital are the result of the timing of payments to our vendors and the timing difference between billing customers for services as required by their contracts and our recognition of related revenue 
as a result of improvements in our management of working capital  prepaid expenses and other assets provided million of cash in fiscal compared to a use of million in fiscal while accounts payable and accrued liabilities provided million in fiscal compared to a use of million in fiscal in our network services and systems segment  our strategy is to market a complete set of solutions rather than individual products that we emphasized in the past 
as a result  more of our network contracts are subject to eitf issue  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
the impact is an increase in cash and deferred revenue as the customer may remit payment in advance even though revenue is recognized in future periods 

table of contents the nature of an information services business is such that it requires a substantial continuing investment in data  technology equipment and product development in order to expand the business 
creation of new and enhanced products is the engine of growth for ndchealth and we continue to invest in our future growth through focus on product development 
we are generally able to fund these investments internally from excess cash generated from operations 
historically we have also expanded our business through acquisitions and strategic investments in other businesses 
the cash we use to expand our business is shown as net cash used in investing activities 
capital expenditures  which reflect our investment in equipment and product development such as capitalized software costs discussed above  were million in fiscal  including million in capitalized software costs and million in capitalized interest  and million in fiscal  including million in capitalized software costs and million in capitalized interest 
capital expenditures were funded from cash from operations in both years 
as we continue the launch of new products in fiscal  we expect a similar level or slight increase of capital expenditures as in while improving our revenue growth  gross profit and ultimately  cash flow 
we used million of cash to complete acquisitions in fiscal  including million for the acquisition of mckesson s omnilink pre and post editing customers 
the remaining use of cash represents the payment of transactions costs related to the completion of the techrx acquisition and additional investment in a provider of technology that allows physicians to write electronic prescriptions using mobile phones  desktop computers  and other web enabled devices 
in fiscal  we incurred a million non cash charge as a result of the write down of our investment in this e prescribing business  which is recorded in loss related to investments see discussion in results of operations 
in fiscal  we used million of cash to complete acquisitions  primarily the completion of our acquisition of techrx 
we acquired a controlling interest in techrx in fiscal as the first step of an agreement to acquire all of their outstanding shares in a two step transaction 
under the second step  which closed on may   we acquired all remaining shares in techrx from minority stockholders for in cash for each techrx common share  or an aggregate of million  net 
the remaining use of cash represents the payment of merger related costs associated with the acquisition 
we currently have in place a million senior credit facility  consisting of a million five year revolving credit facility and a million six year term loan  and have million in senior subordinated notes outstanding 
details of our indebtedness are discussed below 
we believe that our current level of cash on hand  future cash flows from operations  and our credit facility are sufficient to meet our operating needs in fiscal in november  we completed a refinancing that included a new million senior secured credit facility and the issuance of million of senior subordinated notes due in an unregistered offering pursuant to rule a and regulation s under the securities act of on september  we completed an exchange offer whereby we exchanged all of the unregistered notes for substantially identical registered senior subordinated notes 
as of may   the fair market value of the notes was approximately million 
on december   the credit facility was amended to reduce the interest rate and relax certain covenants to provide us added flexibility 
as of may   million was outstanding under the term loan  which bore interest at a weighted average annual interest rate equal to during fiscal the million revolving credit facility is available for working capital and general corporate purposes and has a variable interest rate based on market rates 
during fiscal  we borrowed and repaid a total of million under the revolving credit facility 
as of may  there were no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
during the first quarter of fiscal we borrowed million and have repaid million  as of august   under the revolving credit facility 
the credit facility contains certain financial and non financial covenants customary for financings of this nature 
as of may   we were in compliance with all restrictive covenants 
however  due to our expectations for financial performance during the first quarter of fiscal  we will not meet certain of our current covenant requirements and will need to request a waiver or obtain an amendment to said covenants from our credit group 
while we expect to 
table of contents successfully negotiate any required waivers or amendments and to regain the level of financial performance required to be in compliance with all current restrictive covenants by the end of fiscal  there can be no assurance of this 
borrowings under the amended credit facility bear interest  at our option  at a rate based on either the applicable margin plus the base rate  which is the higher of the per annum rate  which the administrative agent publicly announces from time to time to be its prime lending rate  and the federal funds rate  as published by the federal reserve bank of new york  plus  or the applicable margin plus a   or month london interbank offered rate libor rate 
the amended credit facility eliminated the libor minimum of for term loan borrowings contained in the original facility 
the applicable margin with respect to term loan borrowings is a percentage per annum equal to for base rate borrowings and for libor borrowings 
the applicable margin with respect to borrowings under the revolving credit facility is a percentage per annum equal to for base rate borrowings and for libor borrowings 
the applicable margin is subject to adjustments based on our financial performance 
under the credit agreement there is no cap on the interest rate applicable to the term loan or the revolving credit facility 
mandatory prepayments are required after days following the end of each fiscal year beginning fiscal year ndchealth is obligated to prepay an aggregate principal amount of the loans  and cash collateralize any letter of credit obligations in an amount equal to i of excess cash flow for such fiscal year if the consolidated total leverage ratio is greater than at the end of such fiscal year  and ii of such excess cash flow for such fiscal year if the consolidated total leverage ratio is less than or equal to at the end of the fiscal year 
each such payment shall be applied ratably first to the term facility pro rata to the scheduled amortization payments until all are paid in full and second to the revolving credit facility 
under the mandatory prepayment agreement million is due by august  based on fiscal earnings 
we believe that free cash flow  defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures and dividends paid  is a meaningful measure of our ability to generate cash for reducing our level of senior debt 
free cash flow is not a generally accepted accounting principle gaap measurement and may not be comparable to free cash flow reported by other companies 
free cash flow increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal due to increased net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal in thousands fiscal year ended may  fiscal year ended may  net cash provided by operating activities capital expenditures dividends paid free cash flow upon completion of the refinancing in fiscal discussed above  we received million in proceeds from the million term loan  net of million in costs related to the entire million credit facility  and million in proceeds from the issuance of the notes  net of million in debt issuance costs 
the issuance costs associated with the refinancing are being amortized over the life of the credit facility and notes 
we used million of the net proceeds from the refinancing to repay all indebtedness outstanding under our previous revolving credit facility 
million of the net proceeds from the refinancing were used for redemption of our convertible subordinated notes due november in fiscal  we borrowed million under our previous million unsecured revolving line of credit to partially fund the techrx and scriptline acquisitions described above 

table of contents stock activities provide us an additional source of liquidity 
stock activities are primarily related to the exercises of employee stock options and issues under the employee stock purchase plan 
in fiscal  issuance of shares of our common stock generated million versus million in fiscal although the issuance of additional shares provides us with liquidity  it results in a dilution of each individual stockholder s equity

critical accounting policies are those policies that can have a significant impact on our financial position and results of operations and require complex judgments and the most significant use of these subjective estimates and assumptions 
because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates  actual results may differ from these estimates 
specific risks inherent in our application of these critical policies are described below 
for all of these policies  we caution that future events rarely develop exactly as forecasted  and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
these policies also often require difficult judgments on complex matters that may be subject to multiple sources of authoritative guidance 
additional information concerning our accounting policies can be found in note of notes to our consolidated financial statements 
revenue although we have several sources of revenue  in all cases  in accordance with criteria set forth in staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  sop no 
 software revenue recognition  and other authoritative literature  we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the sales price is fixed or determinable  delivery and performance has occurred  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the most variable of these factors among our various businesses is determining when delivery and performance has occurred 
additionally  we have adopted the provisions of emerging issues task force eitf issue  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  which requires companies to determine whether an arrangement involving multiple deliverables contains more than one unit of accounting 
in our network services and systems segment  the primary source of revenue is fees charged for network services 
we provide these services to our pharmacy  hospital  physician  and payer customers 
these fees are generally based on the volume of services we provide to each individual customer 
in most instances  this fee is charged per transaction and type of transaction while in some instances  these services are provided to large customers for a fixed monthly fee  regardless of each month s actual transaction volume for a portion of the contract term 
we have begun the rollout of hosted web browser based applications for our hospital and pharmacy customers 
the per transaction or per store charges for these services includes charges for the use of the application software  network  and other value added services 
revenue for these services is recognized each month as the services are rendered 

table of contents in our systems businesses  we also receive revenue from software licenses and related maintenance and support agreements 
sop no 
 as amended by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions provide guidance on applying accounting principles generally accepted in the united states for software revenue recognition transactions 
based on these authoritative statements  we recognize revenue as follows revenue from the sale of bundled software licenses and implementation services are recognized on the date that the software is in operation at the customer site where vendor specific objective evidence vsoe has been established for the undelivered elements of the customer contract  which typically is maintenance 
in these cases  the maintenance revenue is recognized over the term of the maintenance contract 
where vsoe cannot be established for undelivered elements within the contract  the revenue related to license fees and implementation services are deferred and recognized upon acceptance over the remaining term of the contract  typically two or three years 
the software we license to our customers is generally one of two types 
the most common software type performs functions such as scheduling and billing and is used by our customers to manage their businesses and connect to our network 
because this type of software has stand alone functionality meaning that connection to our network is not required for the software to be functional  we recognize revenue for sales of products of this type that are customer installed when the product is shipped 
for products of this type that are installed by us or one of our affiliates  we recognize revenue when the software is installed 
the other type of software is used by our customers to process transactions through our network 
because this software provides value to our customers only to the extent that they are utilizing our network services  revenue is recognized over the estimated life of the network services contract rather than when the software is installed 
in instances where revenue is recognized over the term of a contract  or we have contractual minimums  and we incur discrete incremental costs in providing the initial deliverable  we defer these costs and recognize them ratably over the contract term 
we provide software maintenance and customer support to our customers on both an as needed and a contracted long term basis 
services provided outside a maintenance contract are on an as requested basis and revenue is recognized as the services are provided 
revenue for services provided on a contracted long term basis is recognized ratably over the terms of the contract 
in many cases  our physician systems are sold indirectly through vars 
we record revenue when the product is shipped to the vars 
because the vars provide many of the services that we would otherwise provide such as contract support  advertising  etc  we provide them allowances to cover their cost of providing these services 
we record revenue in accordance with eitf issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer or reseller of the vendor s products  which requires that certain allowances be treated as reductions in revenue and allows other allowances  for which we receive separable  identifiable and quantifiable benefits  to be recorded as revenue and operating expense 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we changed our agreements with our vars eliminating the requirement to maintain evidence of contract support and advertising support 
therefore  we have ceased recording these items in revenue and expenses 
in our information management segment  we have two primary sources of revenue database information reporting and consulting services 
database information reporting typically involves the delivery of products providing pharmaceutical information 
these include products with a single delivery and products where multiple deliveries are made over a period of time 
revenue for products involving a single delivery is recognized when obligations to the customer have been fulfilled  which is typically upon delivery 
products with multiple deliveries over a period of time  usually to years  are generally unique in nature and therefore require more complex judgment to determine appropriate revenue recognition 
in most cases  information of a similar type is delivered at equal intervals over a fixed period of time in which case revenue is recognized over the term of the contract using a straight line model 
our consulting services are typically provided for a fixed fee over a specific period of time 
because the terms of these contracts generally include multiple performance milestones  revenue for these services is recognized over the contract term as performance milestones specified in the contract are achieved 
if we determine that we will incur a loss on a contract  we recognize the loss at the time the determination is made 
these contracts typically average to months 
the pharmacy benefit services segment s primary source of revenue is providing pharmacy benefit administration services for prescription drug benefits to clients through the company s network 
table of contents of contractually affiliated retail pharmacies 
revenue is recognized as each drug prescription is fulfilled through its network and the associated drug claim is processed 
through review of all our client contracts  we have determined that the company acts as the principal in all of its network transactions under the indicators of eitf no 
 reporting gross revenue as a principal vs 
net as an agent 
ndchealth acts as a principal because we i have separate contractual relationships with clients and with pharmacies  ii are responsible to validate and economically manage a claim through its claims adjudication process  iii commits to set prescription prices for the pharmacy  iv have discretion in supplier selection and v have credit risk for the price due from the client 
revenue is recorded at the amount our clients have contracted to pay us for the dispensing of such drugs together with any associated administrative fees 
under our pharmacy contracts  the pharmacy is obligated to collect co payments from the member based on the amount we advise them to collect 
as such  we do not include member co payments to retail pharmacies  which totaled approximately million in fiscal  in our revenue or in our cost of service 
capitalized software we have two types of capitalized software software that we develop for sale to our customers shown as capitalized external use software  net and software that we develop for internal use in providing services to our customers included in property and equipment  net 
the costs associated with developing software are capitalized differently depending on whether the software is for sale or for internal use 
in each instance  in accordance with sfas or sop  respectively  costs are capitalized only when the project has reached the point of technological feasibility or the application development stage 
costs incurred prior to this point are charged to earnings as research and development expense 
for software sold to our customers  in accordance with sfas we capitalize both direct and indirect development costs such as programmers salaries and benefits  outside contractor costs  computer time  and allocated facility costs 
completed projects capitalized under sfas are amortized after reaching the point of general availability using the greater of the amount computed using the straight line method or the ratio that current revenues bear to the total of current and anticipated revenues  based on the estimated useful life of the project  normally five years 
the life used for amortization is based on the projected period of time that we will sell the product  typically five years 
for software used internally  in accordance with sop only direct development costs such as programmers salaries and benefits  and fees paid to others for development are capitalized 
completed projects capitalized under sop are amortized using the straight line method 
the life used for amortization is based on the projected period of time that we will use the software to provide services  typically five years 
the actual useful life of the product or software may be longer or shorter than the estimated useful life 
if the actual life is longer  we would continue to realize value from the asset while no longer recognizing a corresponding expense 
if the actual life is shorter or we determine that the investment will not be recovered through the future sales of products or services  the remaining carrying amount may need to be amortized over a shorter period or a non cash charge to earnings could be required 
the net realizable value of capitalized software is monitored on a periodic basis to confirm that the investment will be recovered through the future sale of products or in the case of internal software  through use 
investments we consider and selectively enter into a variety of alliances  joint ventures and investments 
our investments in privately held entities are accounted for under either the cost  equity  or consolidation method  whichever is appropriate for the particular investment 
the appropriate method is determined by our ability to exercise significant influence over the investee  through either quantity of 
table of contents voting stock or other means 
we regularly review our investments for impairment issues and propriety of current accounting treatment 
the primary method we use to determine whether or not an impairment issue exists is to compare the valuation of our investment with the underlying value of the entity in which we have an investment 
we determine the underlying value of the entity based on a number of factors  including the execution of business strategy and the steps that it has and is taking in the execution of that strategy  and the entity s subsequent financing activity 
if we determine that an impairment issue exists  we would realize the loss in other income expense in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
if we determine that our accounting treatment should change from the cost to equity method  in accordance with the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 equity method of accounting for investments in common stock  we would retroactively restate our previously issued financial statements as if we had always accounted for the investment under the equity method 
if our level of investment increased to a level such that we directly or indirectly controlled the entity  we would consolidate the entity s results into our consolidated financial statements 
our investments in publicly traded entities are classified as available for sale securities and are reported at fair value and unrealized gains and losses are reported  net of taxes  as a component of stockholders equity 
for example  if the market price of our investment has declined but we believe that the decline is only temporary because the underlying value of the business is higher than the market indicates  we will report the value of our investment at the price indicated by the market and report any change in the investment s value as an unrealized holding loss 
when a decline is determined to be other than temporary  we realize the gain or loss in other income expense 
finally  we also evaluate each investment for proper treatment under fin consolidation of variable interest entities 
intangible assets intangible assets are created when the purchase price of an acquired business exceeds the value of its tangible assets 
for any significant business we acquire  we obtain a valuation from an independent specialist that assists in the identification of any specific intangibles and provides assistance in our determination of an estimated value and life for each 
goodwill exists where our purchase price exceeds the value of tangible assets plus these specifically identified intangible assets 
specifically identified intangible assets primarily represent proprietary technology  customer relationships  and data access rights 
identified intangibles are assigned a value  generally as estimated in the valuation  and amortized over the estimated life 
because of the complexity of assumptions and judgment used in estimating the value and life of these assets  there is significant risk that their actual value and life may vary from the original estimate 
we periodically evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the carrying amount of intangibles may warrant revision or may not be recoverable 
when factors indicate that an intangible should be evaluated for possible impairment  we estimate the present value of future cash flows associated with the asset over its remaining life 
we may determine that an intangible asset has diminished or has no remaining value prior to it being fully amortized 
in this instance  we would be required to record a charge to earnings to account for impairment of the asset 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  requires that goodwill no longer be amortized but be reviewed for impairment on a regular basis 
the goodwill impairment test has two steps 
the first step is to compare the fair value of each reporting unit with its book value 
our reporting units are defined as our pharmacy  hospital  and physician customer groups in our network services and systems segment plus our total information management segment  and our pharmacy benefit services 
if the estimated current value of future cash flows of any reporting unit is calculated as being lower than its book value  the second step would be to calculate the possible impairment by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount 
any impairment would require a non cash charge to earnings in the period in which the impairment was identified 

table of contents we completed our annual impairment testing during the second quarter of fiscal for each of our reporting units  we found that the estimated fair value exceeded the net book value of the unit and therefore the second step was not necessary 
we updated the study in the fourth quarter of fiscal due to the discontinuance of our european businesses and found that no impairment was necessary as a result of this event 
we will conduct these same tests going forward at least annually during our second fiscal quarter  and more frequently if circumstances suggest potential impairment  to determine that goodwill carried on our balance sheet is properly valued 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  that superseded statement no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
sfas requires that long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  including those of discontinued operations  be measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
discontinued operations are no longer measured at net realizable value or include amounts for operating losses that have not yet been incurred 
sfas also broadens the reporting of discontinued operations to include all components of an entity with operations that can be distinguished from the rest of the entity and that will be eliminated from the ongoing operations in a disposal transaction 
we adopted sfas no 
in the first quarter of fiscal the adoption of sfas has allowed us to treat the pending sale of our european operations as a discontinued operation 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
and technical corrections  which clarifies the criteria under which extinguishments of debt can be considered as extraordinary and rescinds the related statement nos

under eitf issue no 
 a liability for exit costs was recognized at the date of a commitment to an exit plan 
sfas no 
also requires that the liability be measured and recorded at fair value 
accordingly  this standard may affect the timing of recognizing future restructuring costs as well as the amounts recognized 
liabilities recognized prior to the initial application of sfas no 
continue to be accounted for in accordance with preexisting guidance

 accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor 
eitf issue no 
provides that cash consideration received from a vendor is presumed to be a reduction of the prices of the vendor s products or services and should  therefore  be characterized as a reduction in cost of sales unless it is a payment for assets or services delivered to the vendor  in which case the cash consideration should be characterized as revenue  or it is a reimbursement of costs incurred to sell the vendor s products  in which case the cash consideration should be characterized as a reduction of that cost

 revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab no 
s primary purpose is to rescind the accounting guidance contained in sab no 
related to multiple element revenue arrangements that was superseded as a result of the issuance of eitf issue no

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have performed sensitivity analyses over the near term regarding the risks listed below 
based on these sensitivity analyses  we are not exposed to material market risk from changes in interest rates  foreign currency rates and or ndchealth equity prices 
we also do not anticipate any material risk from changes in interest rates  foreign currency rates and or ndchealth equity prices 
interest rate we have a credit facility that has variable interest rates for eurodollar and other floating rate advances based on the libor  prime rate  or federal funds  in each case plus applicable margin 
accordingly  we are exposed to the impact of interest rate movement 
we have performed an interest rate sensitivity analysis over the near term with a change in interest rates 
based on this analysis  our net income would be impacted by approximately million 
there is speculation that floating interest rates could rise to in the next one to two years 
this level of increase would cost us million to million annually if it were to happen 
foreign currency risk we generate a percentage of our net income from our foreign operations 
we have performed a foreign exchange sensitivity analysis over the near term with a change in foreign exchange rates 
based on this analysis  our net income would be impacted by approximately million 
we do not anticipate any material foreign exchange rate risk from changes in foreign currency rates 
additionally  once our european operations  now categorized as discontinued operations  are divested  this risk lessens 
pension plan we have a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan which covers substantially all of our united states employees who had met the plan s eligibility provisions as of may  the annual pension expense that we recognize in accordance with sfas no 
 employer s accounting for pensions  is based on assumptions of key variables including discount rate and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
the selection of assumptions involves significant judgment 
in selecting the long term return on asset and discount rate we consider both current market conditions and expected future market trends  including equity market performance and changes in interest rates 
due to changes in the extended outlook of the investment markets  we reduced the long term return on asset assumption to from effective march  in addition  due to changes in the interest rate environment  we reduced the discount rate to from effective march  effective july   pension benefits were frozen based on current compensation levels 
we have a significant portion of our pension related investment portfolio in long term stock holdings 
we also hold a portion of the investment balance in bonds and other instruments  which are directly influenced by changes in interest rates 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the fair value of the investments to fluctuate 
we have performed a sensitivity analysis for changes in the assumed discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
based on this analysis  a change in the assumed discount rate or return on plan assets would impact our annual net income by approximately million
