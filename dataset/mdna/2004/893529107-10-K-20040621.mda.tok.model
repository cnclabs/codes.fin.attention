item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations reclassification of amounts certain reclassifications of prior fiscal year quarter and prior fiscal year financial information have been made to conform with current fiscal year quarter and current fiscal year presentation 
overview operational overview 
we are a leading distributor of professional grade test  measurement  and calibration equipment and provider of nationally recognized and accredited calibration services across a wide array of measurement disciplines 
we operate our business through two reportable business segments that offer different products and services to the same customer base 
those two segments are distribution products and calibration services 
in our distribution segment  our master catalog is widely recognized by both original equipment manufacturers and customers as the ultimate source for test and measurement equipment 
additionally  because we specialize in test and measurement equipment  as opposed to a wide array of industrial products  our sales and customer service personnel can provide value added technical assistance to our customers to assist them in determining what product best meets their particular application requirements 
our strength in our calibration services segment is based upon our wide range of disciplines and our investment in the quality systems that are required in our targeted market segments 
our services range from the calibration of a single unit to managing a customer s entire calibration program 
our revenue in our distribution products segment has been heavily impacted by the economic environment 
as industrial customers curtailed capital and discretionary spending over much of the last eighteen months  our product sales were adversely impacted 
absent significant economic volatility  we do not see this segment of our business as high growth 
the majority of our products are not consumables but our purchased as replacements  upgrades  or for expansion of manufacturing and research and development facilities 
year over year sales growth in any one month can be impacted by a number of factors 
we believe our calibration services segment offers considerable growth opportunity and the potential for continuing revenue from established customers from what is typically an annual calibration cycle 
we evaluate sales growth in both of our business segments against a four quarter trend analysis  not by analyzing any single quarter 
financial overview 
in fiscal year  we were challenged early in the year with a difficult economic environment 
we focused on controlling our costs  improving the productivity of our calibration laboratories and finding new ways to increase revenue 
our efforts were rewarded with improved performance throughout the year 
our gross margin overall improved by two points 
our products segment gross margin declined as we decided mid year to enter new low margin market segments and to increase our promotional and pricing activity to increase revenue 
the product revenue increase in the fiscal fourth quarter was directly impacted by those decisions 
although that revenue increase was achieved at a lower gross margin  we have increased our customer base and provided additional leads for our calibration services 

table of contents we are very pleased with our eleven point increase in our calibration services gross profit margin resulting from our focus on expense control and productivity improvements 
calibration sales growth offers significant leverage on gross profit due to the relatively fixed nature of a calibration laboratory cost structure 
critical accounting policies and estimates financial reporting release no 
requires all companies to include a discussion of critical accounting principles or methods used in the preparation of financial statements 
note of our consolidated financial statements includes a complete discussion of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
a summary of our most critical accounting policies follows revenue recognition 
sales are recorded when products are shipped or services are rendered to customers  as we generally have no significant post delivery obligations  the product price is fixed and determinable  collection of the resulting receivable is probable and product returns are reasonably estimated 
provisions for customer returns are provided for in the period the related sales are recorded based upon historical data 
our shipments are generally free on board fob shipping point and our customers are generally invoiced for freight  shipping  and handling charges 
goodwill 
on april   we adopted sfas no 
upon adopting sfas  we were required to calculate the fair value of recorded goodwill 
if the fair value of the goodwill does not exceed the carrying value of the goodwill  a write down of the remaining goodwill is necessitated 
we evaluated the fair value of our goodwill and determined that a non cash goodwill impairment of million existed at april  accordingly  in the first quarter of fiscal year  we reported a million charge as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
we re evaluated the fair value of our remaining goodwill  consistent with the provisions of sfas no 
 as of march  and march   and determined no further impairment existed 
at march  and march  goodwill amounted to million 
a change in business could cause additional write off or impairment 
deferred catalog costs 
we amortize the cost of each master catalog mailed over such catalog s estimated productive life 
we review response results from catalog mailings on a continuous basis  and if warranted  we may modify the period over which costs are recognized 
in fiscal year  we reduced our estimate of the productive life of our master catalog from to months  and recognized an additional million in catalog related amortization expense 
we amortize the cost of catalog supplements over a three month period 
total deferred catalog costs were million at march  there were no deferred catalog costs at march  deferred gain on tpg 
as a result of certain post divestiture commitments  according to gaap  we are unable to recognize the gain of million on the divestiture of tpg  which took place in fiscal year  until those commitments expire in fiscal year valuation allowance on deferred tax assets 
a valuation allowance is provided for items for which it is more likely than not that the benefit of such items will not be realized  in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
sfas no 
requires an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when measuring the need for a deferred tax valuation allowance 
a valuation allowance for the full amount of the net deferred tax asset was recorded at march  and march  such valuation allowance increased by approximately million  million  and million for the fiscal years   and  respectively 
stock options 
we follow the disclosure provisions of the accounting principle board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  which does not require compensation costs related to stock options to be recorded in net income  as all options granted under the stock option plan had exercise prices equal to the market value of the underlying common stock at grant date 
sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
requires pro forma disclosure of net income and earnings per share determined as of the fair value method of accounting for stock options had been applied in measuring compensation cost 
if we had chosen to expense stock options  our stock 
table of contents based employee compensation expense for the fiscal years   and would be million  respectively  under the black scholes option pricing model 
see notes and of our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding stock options 
use of estimates 
we make significant estimates and assumptions for  but not limited to allowance for doubtful accounts and returns  inventory valuation  depreciable lives of assets  economic lives of leased assets  useful life and impairment of goodwill  estimated lives of our catalogs  and tax valuation allowances 
future events and their effects cannot be predicted with certainty  accordingly  our accounting estimates require the exercise of judgment 
our estimates will change as new events occur  as more experience is acquired  as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the following table summarizes the more significant charges that require management estimates for the years ended march  march  march  provision for doubtful accounts receivables and returns provision for slow moving or obsolete inventory depreciation of property  plant  and equipment amortization and impairment of goodwill amortization of master catalog costs deferred tax valuation allowance provisions restructuring provisions changes in estimates 
in the ordinary course of accounting for items discussed above  we make changes in estimates as appropriate  and as we become aware of circumstances surrounding those estimates 
such changes and refinements in estimation methodologies are reflected in reported results of operations in the period in which the changes are made and  if material  their effects are disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements 
we do not maintain any off balance sheet arrangements

table of contents fiscal year ended march  compared to fiscal year ended march  dollars in millions sales for the years ended march  march  net sales product service total net sales decreased million  or  from fiscal year to our product sales results  which accounted for of our sales in fiscal year and of our sales in fiscal year  have positively reflected the impact of what we believe is an improved economic outlook  targeted sales efforts in new distribution channels  and customer response to our marketing programs 
our product sales have improved in relation to prior fiscal year quarter comparisons  as follows calculated on dollars in millions fy q q q q product growth customer product orders include orders for products that we routinely stock in our inventory  as well as  customized products and other products ordered less frequently  which we do not stock 
unshippable product orders are primarily backorders  but also include products that are requested to be calibrated in our calibration laboratories prior to shipment  orders required to be shipped complete  orders required to be shipped at a future date  and orders on credit hold and or awaiting letters of credit 
our total unshippable orders increased by approximately million  or from fiscal year to we believe that the increase is primarily attributed to the increase in sales order volume in the fiscal fourth quarter and product order mix 
the following table reflects our historical trend of product orders that are unshippable at the end of each fiscal quarter and the percentage of these orders that are backorders calculated on dollars in millions fy fy q q q q q q q q total unshippable orders of unshippable orders that are backorders calibration services sales declined million  or  from fiscal year to the decline in calibration service sales is primarily attributable to calibrations previously conducted at three customer on site on sites locations that were not renewed by these customers 
we believe that such non renewals resulted from  among other things  factors  such as the adverse economic circumstances in one such customers respective industry telecommunications and corporate sourcing decisions 
as reported  our calibration service sales have declined in relation to the prior fiscal year quarter as follows calculated on dollars in millions fy q q q q calibration service growth

product gross profit decreased million from the prior fiscal year to the current fiscal year  or points 
contributing factors to this point decrease included our aggressive targeting of new channels of distribution that typically do not support the margins of our core customer base and an increased level of allowances to stimulate product sales 
our product gross profit ratio to sales can be impacted by a number of factors that can impact quarterly and annual comparisons 
among those factors are sales to certain channels that do not support the margins of our core customer base  periodic rebates on purchases and cooperative advertising received from suppliers and reported as a reduction of cost of sales in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf see note to our consolidated financial statements 
the following table reflects the quarterly historical trend of our product gross profit as a percent of net sales calculated on dollars in millions fy fy q q q q q q q q product gross profit calibration service gross profit increased million  or points

we have not recognized any tax expense on income  net of certain small state payments 
when calculating income tax expense or benefit  we recognize valuation allowances for deferred tax assets  which may not be realized using a more likely than not approach  which is more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements

we had previously reported in these quarterly reconciliations adjustments of million of severance charges in the fourth quarter of fiscal year and million from the elimination of the cost of restructured personnel in all quarters of fiscal year under recent sec guidance  because we incurred million of severance charges in fiscal year  the items should not be included in reconciliations of this nature and therefore are now excluded from adjustments

this impact is especially evident in the process industry  which has historically been and strategically is a major market for our products 
our product sales excluding divestitures declined by million  or  from fiscal year to of the decline  occurred in the fourth quarter  as industrial spending again was further constrained 
calibration services sales declined million  or  from fiscal year to this decline was also impacted  although not as severely as product sales  by the economic conditions existing over the last twelve months 
more significant  was the impact of certain decisions we made and actions that were taken in the last six months of fiscal year during that period  we consolidated the operations of four calibration laboratories into existing calibration laboratories  and the contract for one unprofitable customer on site was terminated by the customer

this deterioration was largely attributed to product mix and an increased level of discounting necessary under the economic conditions 
the following table presents the quarterly trend of product gross profit on an as reported basis and on a pro forma basis giving effect to the divestitures  which were substantially completed by the end of the third quarter of fiscal year calculated on dollars in millions

as further explained  we have fully reserved our net deferred tax assets 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows 
the following table is a summary of our consolidated statements of cash flows fy fy fy cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities operating activities 
cash provided by operating activities of million for the fiscal year decreased million when compared to the million of cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year the change is comprised of a million increase in cash provided by net income after consideration of the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle and the gain on extinguishment of debt  both of which occurred in fiscal year  a million decrease in depreciation and amortization  and  a million decrease in cash utilized for working capital 
significant working capital fluctuations were as follows our inventories increased million from fiscal year end to compared to a decrease of million from fiscal year end to this net decrease in working capital of million was offset by a net working capital increase in accounts payable of million 
although we increased our inventory in what we believe is an improving economic climate  we have improved our ratio of accounts payable as a percent of inventory  as the following table illustrates dollars in millions fy fy fy inventory  net accounts payable payables inventory ratio our accounts receivables and other receivables increased million from fiscal year end to compared to a decrease of million from fiscal year end to  resulting in a million net decrease in working capital 
we have continued to improve our collections  reflected in our days sales outstanding  as the following table illustrates dollars in millions fy fy fy net sales  for the last two fiscal months accounts receivable  net days sales outstanding based on days the receipt of outstanding tax refunds 
investing activities 
the reduction in cash provided by investing activities resulted from an increase in capital expenditures 
million of cash was also realized in fiscal year resulted primarily from the 
table of contents proceeds of the divestitures 
inclusive of the investment in two new calibration laboratories  capital expenditures in fiscal year totaled million 
financing activities 
in fiscal year  we increased our bank debt by million primarily in support of increased inventory 
debt reduction in fiscal year was million  of which million was the gain on extinguishment of debt  before expenses and warrants and million in cash used for debt reduction 
this follows a reduction in debt in fiscal year  primarily funded by the proceeds of the divestitures  of million 
we believe that we have the financial resources needed to meet our business requirements for the next twelve months  however  the risk factors identified later in item a of this report should additionally be evaluated 
refinancing of debt 
on november   we entered into a revolving credit and loan agreement the credit agreement with gmac business credit  lcc gmac 
the credit agreement expires on november  and replaced our revolving credit and loan agreement with key bank  na and citizens bank dated august  and amended on july  the credit agreement consists of a term loan and a revolving line of credit the loan  certain material terms of which are as set forth below 
the credit agreement was amended on april  to address certain non material post closing conditions 
under the credit agreement  we made a term note in the amount of million in favor of gmac 
this term note requires annual payments totaling million  payable in equal monthly installments  commencing on december  interest on the term note is payable at our option  at prime plus or up to of the loan at the day libor london interbank offered rate plus 
the prime rate and libor as of march  were and  respectively 
in addition  under the credit agreement  we are required to further reduce the term loan  on an annual basis  by excess cash flow  as defined in the credit agreement  not to exceed million per fiscal year 
excess cash flow for the fiscal year ended march  was million 
as a result  we have classified an additional million as a current liability as of march  the maximum amount available under the revolving line of credit portion of the credit agreement is million 
as of march   we had borrowed million under the revolving line of credit 
availability under the line of credit is determined by a formula based on eligible accounts receivable and inventory 
as of march   availability amounted to million 
the credit agreement also has certain covenants with which we must comply  including a minimum ebitda earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization covenant  as well as  restrictions on capital expenditures and master catalog spending 
we were in compliance with such loan covenants as of march  in measuring our compliance with our ebitda covenant  the following table indicates our excess ebitda for the periods indicated fy fy q q q q q q excess ebitda interest on borrowings under the revolving line of credit is payable monthly  at our option  at prime rate  as of march   or up to of the loan at the day libor  as of march   plus 
additional terms of the credit agreement require an increase in our borrowing rate of two percentage points should an event of default occur and a termination premium of of the maximum available borrowing under the revolving line of credit plus the then outstanding balance owed under the term note if the credit agreement is terminated after november  and prior to november  our credit facility with gmac contains a common subjective acceleration clause which allows gmac to call the loan in the event we suffer a material adverse effect or we become unable to repay the loan 
our credit facility also contains a requirement to maintain a lock box that directly applies receipts from customers to reduce the revolving line of credit 
the eitf reached a consensus in november on issue no 
 balance sheet classification of borrowings outstanding under revolving credit agreements that include both a subjective acceleration clause and a lock box arrangement 
this issue requires that in situations where both a subjective acceleration clause and a mandatory lock box arrangement exist  revolving line of credit debt must be classified as short term 
for future cash flow purposes  we consider the revolving line of credit to be a long term source of funds since it is continually re financed on a daily basis 
we further believe that  while gaap 
table of contents requires the revolving line of credit with gmac to be characterized as short term  transcat views the gmac commitment as a long term source of funds 
more importantly  we believe that transcat does not face any current liquidity crisis 
we intend to explore new credit relationships  the nature of which would not require us to report the majority of our indebtedness as short term debt  and we expect to enter into a new credit arrangement during fiscal year additionally  we have pledged certain property and fixtures in favor of gmac  including inventory  equipment  and accounts receivable as collateral security for the loans made under the credit agreement 
the credit agreement also requires us to make the following principal payments on the term note  excluding any reductions attributable to excess cash flow  as discussed above in thousands fiscal year fiscal year total after giving effect to the excess cash flow payments made and the payment to be made attributable to excess cash flow for fiscal year as required under the credit agreement  the following are the future term loan payments as of march  in thousands fiscal year fiscal year total contractual obligations and commercial commitments 
the schedule below contains aggregated information about contractual obligations and commercial commitments that we must make future payments under for contracts such as debt and lease agreements  purchase arrangements  and various operating requirements in millions payments due by period less than more than year years years years total term loan revolving line of credit operating leases capital leases unconditional purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations relates to minimum inventory purchase commitment 
we have received approval from the sec granting confidential treatment to this information under the securities exchange act of  as amended

new accounting pronouncements in november  the eitf reached a consensus on eitf issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
eitf no 
provides guidance on how to determine when an arrangement that involves multiple revenue generating activities or deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes  and if this division is required  how the arrangement consideration should be allocated among the separate units of accounting 
the guidance in the consensus is effective for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  we did not have any such revenue arrangements or deliverables as of march  
table of contents in april  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
amends and clarifies the accounting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities

 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
requires that certain financial instruments  which under previous guidance were accounted for as equity  must now be accounted for as liabilities 
the financial instruments affected include mandatory redeemable stock  certain financial instruments that require or may require the issuer to buy back some of its shares in exchange for cash or other assets and certain obligations that can be settled with shares of stock 
sfas no 
is effective for all financial instruments entered into or modified after may  and must be applied to existing financial instruments the beginning of the first fiscal period after june  we did not have any such financial instruments as of march  the eitf issue no 
 accounting by a reseller for cash consideration received from a vendor provides that cash consideration received from a vendor by a reseller should be considered as a reduction of cost of sales when recognized in the reseller s income statement  as the related inventory is sold 
effective in fiscal year  we applied the provisions of eitf no 
 which resulted in a reduction of cost of products sold on our consolidated statements of operations of million for fiscal year prior to our adoption of eitf no 
and consistent with our historical accounting practices  million and less than million  for fiscal year and  respectively  would have been reported as a reduction of advertising expense and now classified as a reduction of cost of sales 
our adoption of eitf no 
had no material effect on our consolidated balance sheet as of march  employee stock options we have a stock option program that is a broad based  long term retention program intended to attract  incent  and retain key employees  thereby aligning stockholder and employee interests

employee stock purchase plan the transcat  inc employees stock purchase plan plan has up to  shares of our common stock for issuance 
under the plan  eligible employees may purchase stock at of the fair market value of our common stock on the investment date  which is the second to last business day of each calendar month 
purchases are limited under certain circumstances to maintain plan conformance to various regulations 
plan participation was approximately of total employees  including those ineligible  during fiscal year and during fiscal year and shares purchased under the plan were fy fy fy shares purchased outlook as we look ahead to fiscal year  we believe that the economic outlook is positive 
we believe that our distribution products segment will benefit from a stronger economy 
as a result  we expect that our year over year sales growth should be stronger in the first half of the year  mainly due to weaker prior year comparisons 
we also expect that the second half of the year will show more modest single digit growth  typical of our longer term view of the business 
we are planning for sales growth in our calibration segment driven by our sales force efforts to identify and close calibration business leads 
we believe that our growth in any individual quarter will be based solely on the size of new business in that period 
we expect our gross margin to improve overall in the range of points 
any significant increase in our manpower would only result from a need to fulfill new calibration business beyond any laboratory s current capacity 
we intend to add second shift operations as volume dictates 
we are planning on increased catalog supplement mailings in fiscal year to both increase revenue and identify new customers for both business segments 
we expense catalog supplements over a three month period and evaluate the return on the net cost of the supplement against business generated in the following twelve months 
we therefore expect that our marketing expenses will be higher in fiscal year due to the additional mailings 
we are planning on increased capital expenditures in fiscal year  the majority of which will support new assets in our calibration laboratories to both replace older equipment and improve productivity 
we expect to reduce our debt in fiscal year and will evaluate the cost and benefit of moving from our existing asset based lending relationship to a more conventional banking arrangement 
as previously disclosed  we have had a valuation allowance on our deferred assets providing for items for which it is more likely than not that the benefit of such items will not be realized  in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
sfas no 
requires an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when measuring the need for a deferred tax valuation allowance 
the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent three year fiscal period ending march  is sufficient negative evidence to maintain the valuation allowance under the provisions of sfas no 
our results over the most recent three year period were heavily affected by such charges as divestitures  goodwill  severance  restructuring  and litigation 
although we believe that the company today is much stronger  more profitable  and focused on operating a sound  profitable business model  we must maintain a valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to support its reduction or reversal 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rates our exposure to changes in interest rates results from borrowing activities 
in the event interest rates were to move by  our yearly interest expense would increase or decrease by approximately million assuming our average borrowing levels remained constant 
on march  and march   we had no hedging arrangements in place to limit our exposure to upward movements in interest rates 
under the credit agreement described in note of our consolidated financial statements  interest on the term note is payable at our option  at prime plus or up to of the loan at the day libor london interbank offered rate plus 
interest on the revolving line of credit is payable monthly  at our option  at prime rate  as of march   or up to of the loan at the day libor  as of march   plus 
foreign currency approximately and of our sales were denominated in united states dollars with the remainder denominated in canadian dollars for the three months and twelve months ended march   respectively 
a change in the value of the canadian dollar to the united states dollar would impact our revenues by approximately 
we monitor the relationship between the united states and canadian currencies on a continuous basis and adjust sales prices for products and services sold in canadian dollars as we believe to be appropriate 
on march  and march   we had no hedging arrangements in place to limit our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations 
risk factors you should consider carefully the following risks and all other information included in this form k 
the risks and uncertainties described below and elsewhere in this form k are not the only ones facing our business 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition or results of operations would likely suffer 
in that case  the trading price of our common stock could fall and you could lose all or part of your investment 
general economic conditions 
the electronic instrumentation distribution industry is affected by changes in economic conditions  which are outside our control 
we cannot assure you that economic slowdowns  adverse economic conditions or cyclical trends in certain customer markets will not have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition  or our ability to meet our commitments 
dependence on manufacturers 
a significant amount of our inventory purchases are made from one vendor group 
our reliance on this vendor group leaves us vulnerable to having an inadequate supply of required products  price increases  late deliveries  and poor product quality 
like other distributors in our industry  we occasionally experience supply shortages and are unable to purchase our desired volume of products 
if we are unable to enter into and maintain satisfactory distribution arrangements with leading manufacturers  if we are unable to maintain an adequate supply of products  or if manufacturers do not regularly invest in  introduce to us  and or make available to us for distribution new products  our sales could suffer considerably 
finally  we cannot provide any assurance that particular products  or product lines  will be available to us  or available in quantities sufficient to meet customer demand 
this is of particular significance to our business because the products we sell are often only available from one source 
any limits to product access could materially and adversely affect our business 
indebtedness 
although we have paid down a significant portion of the outstanding indebtedness under our secured credit facility  as of march   we owed million to our secured creditor 
we are required to meet financial tests on a quarterly basis and comply with other covenants customary in secured financings 
although we believe that we will continue to be in compliance with such covenants  if we do not remain in compliance with such covenants  our lenders may demand immediate repayment of amounts outstanding 
changes in interest rates may have a significant effect on our monthly payment obligations and operating results 
furthermore  we are dependent on credit from manufacturers of our products to fund our inventory purchases 
if 
table of contents our debt burden increases to high levels  such manufacturers may restrict our credit 
our cash requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the rate of growth of our sales  the timing and levels of products purchased  payment terms  and credit limits from manufacturers  the timing and level of our accounts receivable collections and our ability to manage our business profitably 
our ability to satisfy our existing obligations  whether or not under our secured credit facility  will depend upon our future operating performance  which may be impacted by prevailing economic conditions and financial  business  and other factors described in this form k  many of which are beyond our control 
if existing shareholders sell large numbers of shares of our common stock  our stock price could decline 
the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales by our existing shareholders or holders of stock options of a large number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that these sales could occur 
our stock price has been  and may continue to be  volatile 
the stock market from time to time  has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are both related and unrelated to the operating performance of companies 
as our stock may be affected by market volatility  as well as by our own performance  the following factors  among others  may have a significant effect on the market price of our common stock developments in our relationships with current or future manufacturers of products we distribute  announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments  litigation or governmental proceedings or announcements involving us or our industry  economic and other external factors  such as disasters or other crises  sales of our common stock or other securities in the open market  period to period fluctuations in our operating results  and our ability to satisfy our debt obligations 
we expect that our quarterly results of operations will fluctuate 
such fluctuation could cause our stock price to decline 
a large portion of our expenses for calibration services  including expenses for facilities  equipment and personnel  are relatively fixed  as is our commitment to purchase a predetermined amount of inventory 
accordingly  if revenues decline or do not grow as we anticipate  we may not be able to correspondingly reduce our operating expenses in any particular quarter 
our quarterly revenue and operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to do so in the future 
if our operating results in some quarters fail to meet the expectations of stock market analysts and investors  our stock price would likely decline 
some of the factors that could cause our revenue and operating results to fluctuate include fluctuations in industrial demand for products we sell and or services we provide  and fluctuations in geographic conditions  including currency and other economic conditions 
if we fail to attract and retain qualified personnel  we may not be able to achieve our stated corporate objectives 
our ability to manage our anticipated growth  if realized  effectively depends on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified executive officers and technical personnel 
if we fail to attract and retain qualified individuals  we will not be able to achieve our stated corporate objectives
