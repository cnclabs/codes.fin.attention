item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contractual obligations 
as of december   we had contingent obligations outstanding consisting of indemnity obligations under surety bonds and letters of credit being used for financial assurance purposes  totaling approximately  additionally  domestic and foreign environmental requirements may impose liability for costs of investigation and clean up  regardless of fault or the legality of the original disposal 
clean up costs could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our business may not generate sufficient operating cash flow and our external financing sources may not be available in an amount sufficient to enable us to make anticipated capital expenditures  service or refinance our indebtedness or fund other liquidity needs 
if we are unable to make upgrades or purchase new plant and equipment  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
we may have to take further charges to earnings if our goodwill or asset values are impaired 
we are required to test our goodwill for impairment at least annually 
the difference between the book value of an asset and its market value may indicate that an impairment exists 
in addition  our landfill assets are subject to charges for asset retirement obligations  which are adjusted over time to recognize the current fair market value of the obligations 
we are also subject to charges for impairment or disposal of certain of our long lived assets and facilities 
for instance  over the past three years  we have closed two aluminum recycling facilities and one zinc recycling facility  
table of contents 
index to financial statements provisionally suspended operations at another aluminum recycling facility and reduced the number of furnaces we operate at other domestic facilities 
continued under utilization at our domestic aluminum facilities could result in write downs and impairment charges 
in addition  the carrying value of certain of our properties and assets held for sale could be reduced in the future to their estimated fair values less costs to sell  resulting in additional asset impairment charges at that time 
we do not have long term contractual arrangements with a substantial number of our customers and we may be adversely affected if our customers switch suppliers 
a substantial number of our customers do not have a long term contractual arrangement with us 
these customers purchase products and services from us on a purchase order basis and can cease doing business with us at any time and for any reason 
we cannot assure you that these customers will continue to purchase our products and services 
the loss of these customers or a significant reduction in their purchase orders could reduce our market share and have a material adverse effect on our sales volume and our business 
we could experience labor disputes that could disrupt our business 
approximately of our domestic employees and of our foreign employees are represented by unions or equivalent bodies and are covered by collective bargaining or similar agreements which are subject to periodic renegotiation 
although we believe that we will successfully negotiate new collective bargaining agreements when our other agreements expire  these negotiations may not prove successful  may result in a significant increase in the cost of labor  or may break down and result in the disruption of our operations 
we can give no assurance that such labor negotiations will conclude successfully or that any work stoppage or labor disturbances will not occur 
any such work stoppages or labor disturbances may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk  which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly 
borrowings under our new senior credit facility will be at variable rates of interest and will expose us to interest rate risk 
if interest rates increase  our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase and our net income would decrease 
in addition  we may consider entering into fixed to floating interest rate swaps with respect to a portion of the debt represented by the notes offered hereby 
such a transaction would increase our variable rate debt

index to financial statements the loss of certain members of our senior management could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our success depends  in part  on the efforts of our senior management and other key employees 
these individuals possess sales  marketing  engineering  manufacturing  financial and administrative skills that are critical to the operation of our business 
if we lose or suffer an extended interruption in the services of one or more of our senior officers  our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 
moreover  the market for qualified individuals may be highly competitive and we may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel to replace or succeed members of our senior management or other key employees  should the need arise 
our significant debt obligations could limit our flexibility in managing our business and expose us to certain risks 
we are highly leveraged 
as of december   we would have been able to incur an additional  under our new senior credit facility 
whenever during specified periods including currently  our availability under this facility is less than  we are subject to a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a minimum tangible net worth covenant 
in addition  we may be permitted under our new senior credit facility and the indenture governing the senior secured notes to incur additional debt  subject to certain limitations 
our high degree of leverage may have important consequences including the following we may have difficulty satisfying our obligations under the notes or other indebtedness and  if we fail to comply with these requirements  an event of default could result  we may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to required payments on indebtedness  thereby reducing the availability of cash flow for working capital  capital expenditures and other general corporate activities  covenants relating to our debt may limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures and other general corporate activities  covenants relating to our debt may limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  we may be more vulnerable to the impact of economic downturns and adverse developments in our business  and we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage against any less leveraged competitors 
the occurrence of any one of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations  prospects and ability to satisfy our debt obligations 

table of contents 
index to financial statements we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows to meet our debt service obligations 
our ability to make scheduled payments on  or to refinance our obligations with respect to our indebtedness  including the notes  will depend on our financial and operating performance  which in turn will be affected by general economic conditions and by financial  competitive  regulatory and other factors beyond our control 
we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future sources of capital will be available to us whether under our new senior credit facility or otherwise in an amount sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness and fund our other liquidity needs 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations  we may have to undertake alternative financing plans  such as refinancing or restructuring our debt  selling assets  reducing or delaying capital investments or seeking to raise additional capital 
we cannot assure you that any refinancing would be possible  that any assets could be sold  or  if sold  of the timing of the sales and the amount of proceeds that may be realized from those sales  or that additional financing could be obtained on acceptable terms  if at all 
our inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations  or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms  would materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the ordinary course of its business  we are exposed to potential losses arising from changes in the price of aluminum  zinc and natural gas 
changes in currency values and the level of interest rates also expose our company to potential losses 
we use derivative instruments  such as futures  options  swaps and interest rate caps to manage the effect of such changes 
see note a summary of significant accounting policies of notes to consolidated financial statements 
risk management 
all derivative contracts are held for purposes other than trading  and are used primarily to mitigate uncertainty and volatility and cover underlying exposures 
our commodity and derivative activities are subject to the management  direction and control of our company s risk management committee  which is composed of our chief executive officer  chief financial officer  and other officers and employees that the chief executive officer designates 
the risk management committee reports to our company s board of directors  which has supervisory authority over all of its activities 
counter parties 
our company is exposed to losses in the event of non performance by the counter parties to the derivative contracts discussed below 
although non performance by counter parties is possible  we do not currently anticipate any non performance by any of these parties 
counter parties are evaluated for creditworthiness and risk assessment prior to our initiating contract activities 
the counter parties creditworthiness is then monitored on an ongoing basis  and credit levels are reviewed to ensure that there is not an inappropriate concentration of credit outstanding to any particular counter party 
metal commodity price risk 
aluminum and zinc ingots are internationally produced  priced  and traded commodities  with their principal trading market being the london metal exchange 
as part of our efforts to preserve margins  we enter into futures and options contracts 
in our domestic aluminum and zinc segments  unrealized future gains and losses on these futures and options contracts qualify for deferred treatment sfas accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and sfas accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities 
overview of domestic aluminum and zinc deferred metal hedging activities 
as of december   we had a net deferred gain of approximately   net of tax on our domestic aluminum and zinc metal hedging activities 
as of december   we had a net deferred loss of approximately   net of tax on our domestic aluminum and zinc metal hedging activities 
the majority of the change from year end to year end is due to our zinc forward purchases  which have moved from a deferred loss position to a deferred gain position  mostly resulting from the rise in the price of zinc towards the end of domestic aluminum 
we enter into futures sale contracts with metal brokers to fix the margin on a portion of the aluminum generated by our salt cake processing facility in morgantown  kentucky and some of the aluminum generated for sale from the processing of other scrap metal 
these futures sale

in the normal course of business  we enter into fixed price forward sales and purchase contracts with a number of our zinc customers 
in order to hedge the risk of higher metal prices  we enter into long positions  principally using future purchase contracts 
these contracts are settled in the month of the corresponding production or shipment

the impact of a hypothetical change in the december  lme price of zinc ingot would be material to our estimated gross profit for the year ending december  at this time  we estimate a hypothetical increase in the price of zinc would increase our gross profits for by about  aluminum vaw imco 
for most of  vaw imco had its own hedging program in operation that was functionally independent from ours 
the majority of vaw imco s operations are product sales  requiring it to take ownership of the materials processed and exposing it to more risk to changes in metal prices 
to mitigate this risk  vaw imco enters into lme high grade and alloy aluminum forward sales and purchase contracts 
vaw imco does not hold or issue any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
the functional currency of vaw imco is the euro  however  the derivatives utilized in hedging the market risk of changing prices of aluminum purchases and sales at vaw imco s facilities are based in us dollars 
this results in foreign currency risk in addition to the risk of changing aluminum prices 

table of contents 
index to financial statements unlike the derivative contracts utilized throughout the rest of our hedging operations  the unrealized gains and losses on vaw imco s derivative contracts do not qualify for deferred treatment under sfas  accounting for derivatives and hedging activities 
vaw imco s derivative contracts are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recognized currently in the financial statements

as of december  we estimate that a increase in the lme price of aluminum  holding currency rates constant  would increase our gross profits by  separately  for the same period  we also estimate that a increase in the value of the us dollar against the euro  holding metal prices constant  would increase our gross profits by  natural gas 
natural gas is the principal fuel used in our processing of aluminum and zinc 
natural gas prices are volatile  and we attempt to manage this volatility through the use of derivative commodity instruments 
our natural gas financial derivatives are traded in months forward  and settlement dates are scheduled to coincide with gas purchases during those future periods 
these contracts reference physical natural gas prices or appropriate nymex futures contract prices 
we have entered into forward pricing positions for a portion of our domestic natural gas requirements for we currently have contracts in place to cover about of our natural gas requirements for the succeeding twelve months 
under the terms of our natural gas swap contracts  we make or receive payments based on the difference between the month end closing price on the nymex and the fixed price agreed to in the swap contracts 
the impact of a change in the december  nymex

we estimate that a increase in the price of natural gas  as of december   would decrease our estimated gross profits for the year by approximately  for the twelve month periods ended december   and natural gas hedging activities increased decreased cost of goods sold by the following amounts   and  respectively 
in addition  a portion of our natural gas cost is recovered through price escalation clauses in our long term contracts

we have historically funded our operations from our existing credit facilities 
our former senior credit facility bore interest at a variable rate  accordingly  approximately of our outstanding long term debt as of september  accrued interest at floating rates related to libor plus a margin 
as of december   after giving effect to the senior secured notes issuance and the establishment of the new senior credit facility  approximately of our debt was at floating rates 
our earnings are affected by changes in interest rates due to the impact those changes have on our interest expense from variable rate debt instruments 
if interest rates increased from the rates prevailing as of december   interest expense for the next twelve months would increase by approximately  these amounts are determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our variable rate long term debt outstanding as of december  in addition  we may enter into fixed to floating interest rate swaps with respect to a portion of the indebtedness represented by the new secured notes issued in october such a transaction would increase our variable rate debt 
we did not enter into any interest rate swaps or similar financial risk contracts during or have any outstanding as of december market risk for fixed rate long term debt is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical decrease in market interest rates 
with respect to our fixed rate long term debt outstanding at december   a decline in market interest rates would have resulted in an increase to the

index to financial statements fair value of our fixed rate long term debt of approximately  the fair values of our long term debt were estimated using discounted future cash flows based on our incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements 
foreign currency 
we are increasingly subject to exposure from fluctuations in foreign currencies 
when we consider it appropriate  we will utilize foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge the variability in cash flows from forecasted payment or receipts of currencies 
however  no significant contracts were entered into during  or were outstanding at december  generally  we have not typically sought to mitigate foreign currency translation effects through the use of derivative instruments
