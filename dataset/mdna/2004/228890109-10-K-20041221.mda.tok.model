certain amounts presented in this item have been rounded to the nearest thousand and hundred thousand  as applicable  but the percentages are based on actual amounts without rounding 
the company operates primarily in the beverage alcohol industry in the united states 
the company reports its operating results in four segments bulk alcohol products rum  citrus brandy  citrus spirits  cane spirits  fortified citrus wine  purchased distilled products and byproducts  premium branded spirits primarily cruzan estate rums and cruzan flavored rums  bottling operations contract bottling services and proprietary and private label products  and vinegar and cooking wine bulk vinegar  bulk cooking wine  vinegar stock and proprietary and private label case goods

the company s net sales and gross margins gross profit as a percentage of net sales vary depending on the mix of business among the company s products 
historically  gross margins have been highest in bulk alcohol products and premium branded spirits and lower in bottling operations and vinegar and cooking wine operations 
within its bottling operations  sales and gross margins have varied substantially based upon the mix of business from the company s type a and type b bottling customers 
type a bottling customers pay the company to purchase their raw materials and these costs are passed through to the customer 
type b bottling customers supply their own raw materials and are only charged for bottling charges 
although gross profit per case for the company s type a and type b bottling customers is approximately equal  given the same case volume  net sales and cost of goods sold with respect to products bottled for type a bottling customers are higher  and gross margins are lower  than for type b bottling customers 
as a result  significant fluctuations in volume of type a bottling customers can distort the company s gross margin 
the size and timing of purchase orders and product shipments can cause operating results to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter  particularly since some customers purchase bulk alcohol products in significant quantities or place significant orders for contract bottling services  distilled spirits  vinegar and cooking wine 
additionally  some company products generate higher profit margins than others  and changes in the company s product mix will therefore cause gross margins to fluctuate 
certain aspects of the company s business are also seasonal  with increased demand for the company s contract bottling services from april to october and increased production of the company s bulk alcohol products from november to june  corresponding to the florida citrus harvest 
as a result of these factors  the company s operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
net sales represent the company s gross sales less excise taxes 
excise taxes are generally payable on sales of certain of the company s bulk alcohol products and on all alcohol products bottled by the company 
however  there are no excise taxes paid on sales made to customers that have tax permits 
accordingly  excise taxes may vary significantly from period to period depending upon the company s product and customer mix 
results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal net sales 
net sales were million in  an increase of from net sales of million in net sales of bulk alcohol products were million in  an increase of from net sales of million in the increase resulted primarily from increased shipments of rum and fortified wine offset by decreased shipments of citrus brandy  citrus spirits and cane spirits 
the decrease in citrus brandy  citrus spirits and cane spirits was due in part to the timing of customer orders 
in addition  in  the company had sales of citrus and cane spirits to new customers that had difficulty sourcing bulk alcohol from their regular suppliers 
these sales did not reoccur in management believes that the company s sales of citrus brandy and spirits have declined due to a market surplus of grape spirits which some of the company s customers may be using as an alternative ingredient in their product formulations 
however  management believes that this decline in business is temporary and that the company s sales of citrus brandy and spirits will increase in the future as the market surplus of grape spirits declines 
in  unit sales of citrus brandy and spirits decreased and  respectively  compared to  and the average selling price of citrus brandy decreased 
also in  unit sales of the company s fortified wine products increased compared to  although the average selling price for the company s fortified wine decreased 
the average selling prices for these bulk alcohol products decreased due to management lowering prices as a result of increased competition from grape spirits distillers and foreign wine producers 
net sales of premium branded spirits were million in  an increase of from net sales of million in sales of the company s cruzan estate rums and cruzan flavored rums increased in compared to sales of cruzan estate rums and cruzan flavored rums increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal during this time  the cruzan brand has been recognized as one of the fastest growing brands in the spirits industry by certain beverage industry publications and the cruzan rums have won numerous tasting awards from several prestigious beverage industry organizations 
since january  several of the company s competitors have introduced their own lines of flavored rum products into the marketplace  which  in certain fiscal quarters  has negatively impacted the level of sales growth of cruzan flavored rums 
some of the company s competitors in the rum and flavored rum categories have significantly greater financial and other resources than the company  which could adversely affect the company s sales growth of cruzan estate rums and cruzan flavored rums 
as a response to such increased competition  and in order to provide further impetus to the growth of cruzan flavored rums  management significantly increased its marketing budget for fiscal in an effort to support the continued growth of the company s cruzan brand  causing a current increase in the operating loss for this business segment 
management intends to continue its increased expenditures in to improve brand growth 
in august and september  the eyes of three major hurricanes struck within approximately thirty miles of all of the company s facilities in central florida 
physical damage to the company s facilities of less than  occurred as a result of these hurricanes 
however  while difficult to quantify  disruptions to business caused by these hurricanes  including several days of plant shut downs  prolonged loss of power  product shipment interruptions and increased labor costs  contributed to lost sales in the premium branded spirits segment  as well as to the additional costs in the bottling and vinegar and cooking wine segments as discussed below 
the company and its insurance advisor determined that the losses incurred during these hurricanes  including physical damage and business interruption  did not meet the deductible levels of the company s casualty insurance policies due mainly to the fact that each hurricane had a separate deductible requirement and the company s disruptions were incurred over the course of all of the hurricanes  as well as the relatively minor physical damage incurred 
net sales of the company s bottling operations were million in  a decrease of from net sales of million in during the first quarter of fiscal  the company lost a large private label bottling customer 
net sales to this private label bottling customer were approximately million and  cases for the year ended september   or approximately of bottling operations net sales and of bottling operations volume 
also during  excise taxes decreased million compared to  primarily due to the decrease in sales to this private label bottling customer 
sales in the company s bottling operations also continued to decline as a result of a contraction in the ready to drink product category  for which the company is a major contract bottler 
responding to this decline  in july the company completed the partial consolidation of its bottling operations to reduce overhead 
however  bottling operations volume has not met even the company s reduced expectations for  which has caused a continuing loss in this segment 
the company has been placing a renewed emphasis on the sales effort in this segment  seeking other contract bottling opportunities 
the company has explored other alternatives in its two bottling facilities  including further consolidation  a partial sale and shedding less profitable product lines 
in december  management decided to discontinue production of all products in the lake alfred bottling plant with the exception of one profitable production line bottling vinegar  cooking wine and juices 
at the present time  the company has not taken an impairment charge relating to its bottling operations as the carrying value of its bottling assets is less than management s estimate of fair value 
net sales of vinegar and cooking wine were million in  an increase of from net sales of million in in  total unit sales of vinegar and cooking wine decreased compared to  although the average selling price per unit increased 
the average selling prices of vinegar and cooking wine increased due to a combination of decreased sales of lower priced white distilled vinegar and bulk cooking wine and a slight increase in sales of higher priced cooking wine case goods

financial liquidity and capital resources general the company s principal use of cash in its operating activities is for purchasing raw materials to be used in its manufacturing operations and purchasing imported products for its premium branded spirits business 
the company s source of liquidity has historically been cash flow from operations and its line of credit 
some of the company s manufacturing operations are seasonal and the company s borrowings on its line of credit vary during the year 
the florida citrus harvest is generally during the months from november through june 
the majority of the florida citrus harvest is processed as fresh fruit juice or juice concentrate 
a byproduct of citrus juice production is citrus molasses which the company uses as a raw material at its two florida distilleries to produce citrus brandy and spirits 
due to the seasonal availability and short shelf life of the citrus molasses raw material  the company produces its estimated annual customer requirements during a seven month period  and therefore  carries a higher than normal level of inventory in relation to sales during this seven month period 
generally  the company s inventory level increases during this seven month period and decreases after the citrus harvest ends when the company supplies its customers with citrus brandy and spirits from inventory from july through october 
there are no federal regulations that require minimum aging to be designated rum 
however  due to the company s high quality standards  the company ages its cruzan estate rums for two to five years and certain of the company s super premium rums are aged up to twelve years 
due to the company s own aging requirements  production of cruzan estate rums is scheduled to meet demand two to three years in the future 
accordingly  inventories are larger in relation to sales and total assets than would be normal for most other businesses 
management expects to continue to increase the company s inventory of barrel aged rums to meet projected increased sales in the future 
another seasonal business of the company is its contract bottling services 
demand for contract bottling services is highest from april through october 
during these months the company s requirements increase for ingredients  glass bottles  caps  labels  packaging materials and labor 
during  the company incurred losses from its bottling operations of million 
management has explored alternatives for its two bottling facilities  including further consolidation  a partial sale and shedding less profitable product lines 
in december  management decided to discontinue production of all products in the lake alfred bottling plant with the exception of one profitable production line bottling vinegar  cooking wine and juices 
during  management increased selling  general and administrative expenses in its premium branded spirits segment in an effort to support the continued growth of the company s cruzan brand 
management intends to continue its increased expenditures in to improve brand growth 
to the extent that the increased expenditures do not result in increased sales of the cruzan brand  the company s short term liquidity may be adversely affected 
however  management actively monitors sales and expenditures on an ongoing basis  and retains the ability to adjust its level of expenditures in response to market conditions and in order to maintain sufficient liquidity 
management believes that cash provided by its operating and financing activities will provide adequate resources to satisfy its working capital  liquidity and anticipated capital expenditure requirements for both its short term and long term capital needs 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities in was million  which resulted from million in net income adjusted for noncash items  and a million net change in operating assets and liabilities 
in  the company spent million on sprinkler systems and safety equipment in its distilling and bottling operations to satisfy insurance requirements  which reduced the company s insurance premiums 
investing and financing activities net cash used in investing activities in was million  including capital expenditures of million partially offset by a redemption of short term investments of million 
in  the company spent million on sprinkler systems and safety equipment in its distilling and bottling operations to satisfy insurance requirements which reduced the company s insurance premiums 
net cash used in financing activities in was million  which resulted primarily from a million net decrease in borrowings under the revolving credit facility  million of payments on long term debt off set by million from the issuance of common stock 
in october  the company entered into a million credit agreement  consisting of a million term loan and a million revolving loan facility 
during march  the credit agreement was amended to reduce the revolving loan facility to million 
in june  the credit agreement was modified to extend the maturity date of the revolving loans to be the same as the term loans  september see note to the company s consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the company s long term debt 
in december  the company received a waiver of its financial covenants compliance requirement for the quarter ended september  the financial covenant requirements were also amended prospectively in accordance with the company s business plan for the following fiscal year 
the company agreed to a 
increase from its current interest rates so long as the funded debt to ebitda ratio is between and 
in addition  if the company s funded debt to ebitda ratio is between and  the interest rate would be 
higher than the rate for the to level 
the maturity of the credit agreement was modified to january   and the company paid an amendment fee of  the company s bank debt was million as of september   and its ratio of total debt to equity was to the company s share of the undistributed earnings of its bahamian and virgin islands subsidiaries was approximately million as of september  no provision has been made for taxes which would result from the remittance of such undistributed earnings  as the company intends to reinvest these earnings indefinitely 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements for additional information on income taxes related to these subsidiaries 
based on current plans and business conditions  management expects that its cash and cash equivalents  together with any amounts generated from operations and available borrowings  will be sufficient to meet the company s cash requirements for at least the next months 
critical accounting policies the company s significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to the company s consolidated financial statements located in item of this annual report on form k 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses  and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes that the following critical accounting policy is subject to estimates and judgments used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements the company has goodwill and intangible assets associated with business acquisitions 
the company reviews these assets for impairment annually and whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of these assets below their carrying value 
if the fair value of these assets is less than their carrying value  then an impairment loss would be recognized equal to the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has no off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the company s financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors

the company recorded a charge for the retirement of mr 
edwards of  during the third quarter of fiscal the effect of this charge was included in other expense in the company s consolidated statement of operations 
the effect of these charges  net of income tax benefits  was approximately million or 
per common share in fiscal effects of inflation and changing prices the company s results of operations and financial condition have not been significantly affected by inflation and changing prices 
the company has been able  subject to normal competitive conditions  to pass along rising costs through increased selling prices 
risks that may affect future results in addition to the risks and uncertainties of ordinary business operations  important factors that could cause the company s actual results to differ materially from those contained in or implied by any forward looking statements contained in this annual report on form k include the company faces competition that may reduce its market share and margins 
the company is in a highly competitive industry and the dollar amount and unit volume of its sales could be negatively affected by the company s inability to maintain or increase prices  changes in geographic or product mix  a general decline in beverage alcohol consumption or the decision of wholesale customers  retailers or consumers to purchase competitors products instead of the company s products 
since march  no less than four of the company s largest competitors bacardi  diageo  allied domecq and pernot ricard have introduced competitive flavored rum product offerings 
each of these competitors has greater financial resources than the company 
wholesaler  retailer and consumer purchasing decisions are influenced by  among other things  the perceived absolute or relative overall value of the company s products  including their quality or pricing  compared to competitive products 
unit volume and dollar sales could also be affected by pricing  purchasing  financing  operational  advertising or promotional decisions made by wholesalers  state and provincial agencies  and retailers  which could affect their supply of  or consumer demand for  the company s products 
the company could also experience higher than expected selling  general and administrative expenses if management finds it necessary to increase the number of personnel or advertising or promotional expenditures to maintain the company s competitive position or for other reasons 
increased competition and unanticipated actions by competitors or customers could lead to downward pressure on prices and or a decline inthe company s market share  which would adversely affect the company s results and hinder its growth potential 
the company s bottling operations have declined  and may continue to decline in the short term 
net sales of the company s bottling operations for fiscal decreased by from fiscal during the first quarter of fiscal  the company lost a large private label bottling customer that accounted for approximately of its bottling operations net sales and of its bottling operations volume 
sales in the company s bottling operations also continued to decline as a result of a contraction in the ready to drink product category  for which the company is a major contract bottler 
responding to this decline  in july the company completed the partial consolidation of its bottling operations to reduce overhead 
however  bottling operations volume has not met even management s reduced expectations for fiscal  which has caused a continuing loss in this segment 
the company has been placing a renewed emphasis on the sales effort in this segment  seeking other contract bottling opportunities 
the company has explored other alternatives in its two bottling facilities  including further consolidation  a partial sale and shedding less profitable product lines 
in december  management decided to discontinue production of all products in the lake alfred bottling plant with the exception of one profitable production line bottling vinegar  cooking wine and juices 
management cannot assure that its efforts will be successful  or that this segment will experience operating profits in the future 
the company s premium branded spirits segment has experienced  and may continue to experience  operating losses as the company reinvests its gross profit from that and other segments in the company s selling  general and administrative expense for the premium branded spirits segment 
net sales of the company s premium branded spirits segment  which includes cruzan estate rums and cruzan flavored rums  for fiscal increased by compared to fiscal however  during fiscal  the company s premium branded spirits segment experienced operating losses of million  up from operating losses of million in fiscal these operating losses reflect management s continuing efforts to increase market share by reinvesting this and other segments gross profits in selling and marketing expenses for the premium branded spirits segment 
during  the company increased its selling  general and administrative expenses in its premium branded spirits segment in an effort to support the continued growth of the company s cruzan brand 
management intends to continue its increased expenditures in to improve brand growth 
the company cannot assure that its increased selling and marketing efforts will be successful  or that this segment will experience operating profits in the future 
the seasonality of the company s business and the timing of orders could cause operating results to fluctuate 
the size and timing of purchase orders and product shipments can cause the company s operating results to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter  particularly since some customers purchase bulk alcohol products in significant quantities or place significant orders for contract bottling services  vinegar and cooking wine 
additionally  some of the company s products generate higher profit margins than others  and changes in the company s product mix will therefore cause gross margins to fluctuate 
certain aspects of the company s business are also seasonal  with increased demand for the company s contract bottling services from april to october and increased production of some of the company s bulk alcohol products from november to june  corresponding to the florida citrus harvest 
as a result of these factors  the company s operating results may be erratic  varying significantly from quarter to quarter 
the company s dependence on distribution channels may limit its ability to sell its products 
the company sells its popular price and premium branded spirits principally to wholesalers for resale to retail outlets  including package liquor stores and restaurants 
the replacement or poor performance of the company s major wholesalers or the company s inability to collect accounts receivable from its major wholesalers could materially and adversely affect the company s results of operations and financial condition 
distribution channels for alcoholic beverages have been characterized in recent years by rapid change  including consolidations of certain wholesalers 
wholesalers and retailers of the company s products offer products which compete directly with the company s products for retail shelf space and consumer purchases 
accordingly  there is a risk that these wholesalers or retailers may give higher priority to competitors products 
the company cannot assure that its wholesalers and retailers will continue to purchase the company s products or provide the company s products with adequate levels of promotional support 
the company must maintain a relatively large inventory of its products to support customer delivery requirements  and if this inventory becomes obsolete and the company is required to write down its inventory  the company s operating results would be adversely affected 
the company must maintain a relatively large inventory to meet customer delivery requirements for the company s products  including those in its bulk alcohol  premium branded spirits  bottling operations  and vinegar and cooking wine segments 
inventory may become obsolete as the company and its customers introduce new products  cease to produce old products  or modify the design of a product s packaging 
the company maintains a provision for inventory obsolescence to cover potential write downs in inventory for obsolescence  but the company cannot assure that this provision is adequate  and inventory obsolescence could harm the company s operating results 
the company may be unable to comply with its lender s financial covenants  and therefore the company s debt repayment may be accelerated unexpectedly 
in october  the company entered into a million credit agreement  consisting of a million term loan and a million revolving loan facility 
during march  the credit agreement was amended to reduce the revolving loan facility to million 
in june  the credit agreement was modified to extend the maturity date of the revolving loans to be the same as the term loans  september in december  the company received a waiver of its financial covenants compliance requirement for the quarter ended september  the financial covenant requirements were also amended prospectively in accordance with the company s business plan for the following fiscal year 
the company agreed to a 
increase from its current interest rates so long as the funded debt to ebitda ratio is between and 
in addition  if the company s funded debt to ebitda ratio is between and  the interest rate would be 
higher than the rate for the to level
