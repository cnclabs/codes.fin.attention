item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
forward looking statements when used within this document  the words expects  believes  anticipates  should  estimates  and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements within the meaning of that term in section a of the securities exchange act of  as amended  and in section f of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
such forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties  and other factors  which may cause the actual results and performance of the company to be materially different from those expressed or implied in the forward looking statements 
such factors are described in item a  risk factors and include changes in general economic conditions and in the markets in which the company operates and the impact of competition from new and existing storage and commercial facilities and other storage alternatives  which could impact rents and occupancy levels at the company s facilities  difficulties in the company s ability to evaluate  finance and integrate acquired and developed properties into the company s existing operations and to fill up those properties  which could adversely affect the company s profitability  the impact of the regulatory environment as well as national  state  and local laws and regulations including  without limitation  those governing real estate investment trusts  which could increase the company s expense and reduce the company s cash available for distribution  consumers failure to accept the containerized storage concept which would reduce the company s profitability  difficulties in raising capital at reasonable rates  which would impede the company s ability to grow  delays in the development process  which could adversely affect the company s profitability  and economic uncertainty due to the impact of war or terrorism could adversely affect our business plan 
we disclaim any obligation to publicly release the results of any revisions to these forward looking statements reflecting new estimates  events or circumstances after the date of this report 
critical accounting policies qualification as a reit income tax expense we believe that we have been organized and operated  and we intend to continue to operate  as a qualifying real estate investment trust reit under the internal revenue code and applicable state laws 
a qualifying reit generally does not pay corporate level income taxes on its taxable income that is distributed to its shareholders  and accordingly  we do not pay or record as an expense income tax on the share of our taxable income that is distributed to shareholders 
given the complex nature of the reit qualification requirements  the ongoing importance of factual determinations and the possibility of future changes in our circumstances  we cannot provide any assurance that we actually have satisfied or will satisfy the requirements for taxation as a reit for any particular taxable year 
for any taxable year that we fail or have failed to qualify as a reit and applicable relief provisions did not apply  we would be taxed at the regular corporate rates on all of our taxable income  whether or not we made or make any distributions to our shareholders 
any resulting requirement to pay corporate income tax  including any applicable penalties or interest  could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
unless entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions  we also would be disqualified from taxation as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost 
there can be no assurance that we would be entitled to any statutory relief 
impairment of long lived assets substantially all of our assets consist of long lived assets  including real estate assets  associated with the containerized storage business  goodwill  and other intangible assets 
we evaluate our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis  and on a quarterly basis evaluate other long lived assets for impairment 
as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  the evaluation of goodwill for impairment entails valuation of the reporting unit to which goodwill is allocated  which involves significant judgment in the area of projecting earnings and determining appropriate price earnings multiples and discount rates 
in addition  the evaluation of other long lived assets for impairment requires determining whether indicators of impairment exist  which is a subjective process 
when any indicators of impairment are found  the evaluation of such long lived assets then entails projections of future operating cash flows  which also involves significant judgment 
we identified one such impairment to our real estate facilities during  and recorded impairment charges with respect to the containerized storage facilities see note 
no additional impairments were noted at december  future events  or facts and circumstances that currently exist that we have not yet identified  could cause us to conclude in the future that other long lived assets are impaired 
any resulting impairment charge could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
estimated useful lives of long lived assets substantially all of our assets consist of depreciable  long lived assets 
we record depreciation expense with respect to these assets based upon their estimated useful lives 
any change in the estimated useful lives of those assets  caused by functional or economic obsolescence or other factors  could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
estimated level of retained risk liabilities as described in notes and to the consolidated financial statements  we retain certain risks with respect to property perils  legal liability  and other such risks 
in connection with our retention of these risks  we accrue losses based upon our estimated level of losses incurred using certain actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry and based upon our experience 
while we believe that the amounts of the accrued losses are adequate  the ultimate liability may be in excess of or less than the amounts provided 
accruals for contingencies we are exposed to business and legal liability risks with respect to events that have occurred  but in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  we have not accrued for such potential liabilities because the loss is either not probable or not estimable or because we are not aware of the event 
future events and the result of pending litigation could result in such potential losses becoming probable and estimable  which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
some of these potential losses  which we are aware of  are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
accruals for operating expenses we accrue for property tax expense and other operating expenses based upon estimates and historical trends and current and anticipated local and state government rules and regulations 
if these estimates and assumptions are incorrect  our expenses could be misstated 
overview the self storage industry is highly fragmented and is composed predominantly of numerous local and regional operators 
competition in the markets in which we operate is significant and has increased over the past several years due to additional development of self storage facilities 
we believe that the increase in competition has had a negative impact to our occupancy levels and rental rates in many markets 
however  we believe that we possess several distinguishing characteristics that enable us to compete effectively with other owners and operators 
we are the largest owner and operator of self storage facilities in the united states with direct and indirect ownership interests as of december  in  self storage facilities containing approximately million net rentable square feet 
all of our facilities are operated under the public storage brand name  which we believe is the most recognized and established name in the self storage industry 
located in the major metropolitan markets of states  our self storage facilities are geographically diverse  giving us national recognition and prominence 
this concentration establishes us as one of the dominant providers of storage space in most markets in which we operate and enables us to use a variety of promotional activities  such as television advertising as well as targeted discounting and referrals  which are generally not economically viable to most of our competitors 
in addition  we believe that the geographic diversity of the portfolio reduces the impact from regional economic downturns and provides a greater degree of revenue stability 
we will continue to focus our growth strategies on i improving the operating performance of our existing self storage properties  ii increasing our ownership of self storage facilities through development and acquisitions  iii improving the operating performance of our containerized storage business  and iv participating in the growth of ps business parks  inc psb 
major elements of these strategies are as follows o we will focus on enhancing the operating performance of our self storage properties  primarily through increases in revenues achieved through the telephone reservation center and associated marketing efforts 
during  the consistent group of facilities exhibited reductions in rental income and net operating income before depreciation of and  respectively 
during  while revenues increased  net operating income before depreciation decreased due to a increase in operating expenses 
we believe that these trends in and were attributable to the impact of changes in our marketing strategy as well as to general economic conditions 
see self storage operations consistent group of facilities for further discussion 
we expect future increases in rental income to come from increases in occupancy and increases in realized rent  although there can be no assurance 
o we will continue to develop new self storage locations  though at a lower level than occurred in previous years 
during the five years ending december   the company and the consolidated development joint venture developed and opened a total of storage facilities at a cost of approximately million 
in  we opened facilities with an aggregate cost of  at december   we have a development pipeline which includes self storage facilities that are expected to cost an aggregate of million  which we expect will open over the next months 
o we will look to expand and further invest into our existing self storage locations 
during and  we closed containerized storage facilities of which were facilities that combine industrial space previously used by the containerized storage operations with traditional self storage space 
these facilities offer the opportunity to build out additional traditional self storage space at a low cost 
we have added  net rentable square feet of traditional self storage space in connection with converting of these facilities for an aggregate cost of  in  and at december  have additional conversions in process with  net rentable square feet of self storage space at a cost of  in addition to these conversions of space  we have expansions of existing self storage facilities in our pipeline  with an estimated cost of  o we will acquire facilities from third parties 
this activity has not contributed significantly to our growth over the past three years  as we have acquired only self storage facilities from third parties 
we believe that our national telephone reservation system and marketing organization present an opportunity for increased revenues through higher occupancies of the properties acquired from third parties  as well as cost efficiencies through greater critical mass 
o we will attempt to continue to acquire self storage facilities from affiliates or interests in affiliated entities that own self storage facilities which we manage  as they become available from time to time 
the pool of such available acquisitions has continued to decrease as we have acquired such remaining interests over the last several years 
o we will continue to focus on improving the containerized storage operations 
over the last three years  we have developed facilities that combine containerized storage and traditional self storage 
these facilities have replaced facilities previously leased from third parties  thereby reducing third party lease expense 
during and  we closed a total of facilities that were deemed to be non strategic to the company s business plan 
we continue to evaluate the optimum level of containerized facility operations in each market in which we operate and may close additional facilities during in addition  we continue to refine the operating model of the containerized storage business 
o through our investment in psb  we will continue to participate in the growth of this company s investment in approximately million net rentable square feet of commercial space at december  results of operations net income net income for was  compared to  for  representing an increase of  or 
this increase in net income is primarily a result of an increase in the operations of our newly developed and expansion self storage facilities  reduced losses from discontinued containerized storage operations  improved operations of our continuing containerized storage business  a net gain from the sale of real estate assets versus a net loss recorded in and lower interest expense resulting primarily from lower average debt balances 
the effect of these increases were partially offset by a reduction in our consistent group operating results as discussed below  increased depreciation expense resulting primarily from new property additions  and a decrease in equity in earnings of real estate entities 
the decrease in equity in earnings of real estate entities is primarily due to a reduction in our pro rata share of the earnings of ps business parks  inc psb caused by the impact of gains on sale of real estate and asset impairment charges during and net income was  for compared to  for  representing a decrease of  or 
the decrease in net income was caused primarily by a decrease in the operating results of our consistent group of self storage properties  increased depreciation expense resulting primarily from new property additions  and charges relating to the closure of several containerized storage facilities 
the impact of these items was partially offset by increased earnings generated by the acquisition of additional real estate investments during and  the earnings generated by the tenant reinsurance business that was acquired at the end of  reduced general and administrative expense  and a decrease in income allocated to minority interests 
allocations of income among shareholders in computing the net income allocable to common shareholders for each period  we have deducted from net income i distributions paid to the holders of the equity stock  series a totaling  in   in  and  in  ii distributions paid to our preferred shareholders totaling  in   in  and  in  and iii amounts allocated to preferred shareholders in connection with preferred stock redemption activities as described below  totaling  in   in and  in in july  the securities and exchange commission clarified an accounting standard eitf topic d  which we implemented in  with restatements for and to conform to the presentation 
eitf topic d requires that the original issuance costs of redeemed preferred stock in the case of the company  these costs represent approximately of the liquidation preference  representing the underwriting discount  plus other issuance costs as an additional allocation of income to the preferred shareholders  in determining the allocation of income to the common shareholders and earnings per share 
for the years ended december    and  such original issuance costs and resultant allocations of income to the preferred shareholders total   and  respectively 
in the first quarter of  we called for redemption our series l cumulative preferred stock and  accordingly  an additional allocation of income to the preferred shareholders will be recorded of approximately  in the first quarter of future allocations of income pursuant to eitf topic d will depend upon how much preferred stock we redeem and the original issuance costs 
net income per share net income was per common share  on a diluted basis  for compared to per common share for this increase was attributable to the factors denoted above with respect to net income and a reduction in income allocated to preferred shareholders described above  partially offset by an increase in diluted shares outstanding from  in to  in the increase in shares outstanding was due to the exercise of employee stock options and the issuance of common shares in connection with the acquisition of partnership interests 
net income was per common share  on a diluted basis  for compared to per common share for in addition to those factors denoted above with respect to the reduction in net income in  net income per share  on a diluted basis  decreased due to an increase in net income allocated to holders of the equity stock  series a  an increase in net income allocated to preferred shareholders with respect to distributions paid as described above  and an increase in weighted average diluted common shares outstanding 
these factors were offset partially by a decrease in income allocated to preferred shareholders  in accordance with the sec observer s clarification of eitf topic d described above  from  in to  in  which was due to a lower level of preferred stock redemptions in as compared to diluted weighted average common equivalent shares outstanding totaled  for compared to  for included in the distributions paid to our preferred shareholders during the year ended december   is approximately  paid to our series w and series x preferred shareholders 
these two series of preferred stock were issued during the fourth quarter of  raising aggregate gross proceeds of approximately million 
the net proceeds from these issuances funded the redemption of two series of preferred stock our series k and series l during the first quarter of in the interim  the net proceeds from these issuances earned nominal interest income relative to the corresponding dividend requirement 
this difference resulted in an estimated reduction to earnings per common share of approximately per share on a diluted basis during the year ended december  during the first quarter  we issued approximately million of additional preferred stock in two separate transactions 
the net proceeds from these issuances will be used primarily to redeem approximately million of higher rate preferred stock during the third quarter of in the interim  the net proceeds from these issuances are expected to earn nominal interest income relative to the corresponding divided requirement 
this difference will result in an estimated reduction to earnings per common share 
in addition  we may issue up to million of additional preferred stock during  raising the necessary funds to redeem additional high rate preferred stock during the first quarter of these issuances similarly will have a negative impact on earnings per share until the proceeds are utilized 
real estate operations self storage operations our self storage operations are by far the largest component of our operating activities  representing approximately of our revenues generated during rental income with respect to our self storage operations has grown from  in to  in  representing an increase of 
in  rental income grew to  representing an increase of over the year over year improvements in rental income include changes in the performance of those properties that we owned throughout the three year period and the increase in the number of properties in our portfolio either through our acquisition or development activities 
at the end of  we had a total of  self storage facilities included in our consolidated financial statements

these facilities were owned for the entire three year period ending december   however  year over year operating results are not comparable throughout the periods presented due primarily to expansions in their net rentable square footage or their conversion into facilities used by our containerized storage operations 
such construction activities can cause a decline in revenue levels  as existing capacity is made unavailable in order to accommodate construction activities 
during the four years ended december   we completed construction with respect to these facilities totaling million

these facilities were developed and opened since january  at a total cost of million 
self storage operations consistent group of facilities at december   we owned  self storage facilities that have operated at a stabilized level of operations throughout the three year period 
the consistent group of facilities contains approximately  net rentable square feet  representing approximately of the aggregate net rentable square feet of our self storage portfolio 
revenues and operating expenses with respect to this group of properties are set forth in the above self storage operations table under the caption  consistent group 
the following table sets forth additional operating data with respect to the consistent group of facilities consistent group year ended december  year ended december  percentage percentage change change dollar amounts in thousands  except rents per square foot base rental income     promotional discounts     adjusted base rental income     late charges and administrative fees collected

    a square foot occupancies represent weighted average occupancy levels over the entire fiscal year 
b realized annual rent per occupied square foot is computed by dividing adjusted base rental income by the weighted average occupied square footage for the year 
realized rents per square foot take into consideration promotional discounts  bad debt costs  credit card fees and other costs  which reduce rental income from the contractual amounts due 
c annualized revenue per available square foot revpar represents adjusted base rental income divided by total available net rentable square feet 
d in place annual rent per occupied square foot represents contractual rents per occupied square foot without reductions for promotional discounts 
e posted annual rent per square foot represents the rents charged to new tenants prior to any promotional discounts 
as indicated in the table above  rental income for our consistent group decreased in as compared to this decrease was primarily due to a reduction in the weighted average occupancy in compared to partially offset by an increase in realized annualized rent per square foot of 
we believe that the reduction in occupancy during was primarily due to a change in our marketing strategy during historically  our marketing strategy was to offer a variety of promotional discounts and to conservatively price our space to attract new tenants 
during  the consistent group s occupancy levels averaged 
this relatively high occupancy level was attained and sustained through a variety of promotional activities offering new tenants move in promotional discounts aggregating million in this annual level of discounts was consistent with those given in years prior to in  we changed our marketing strategy and began to aggressively increase rental rates and reduce the amount of promotional discounts offered to new tenants 
we believed that this strategy had the benefit of significantly increasing our rental income  with the potential risk of lowering occupancy levels 
during the first nine months of  this strategy significantly enhanced the growth in our rental income 
the downside to our more aggressive strategy was that our average occupancy levels during the first nine months of were approximately below the level experienced during the same period in we believed that the decrease in occupancy levels was a manageable reduction and was more than offset by the increase in rental income attained through higher rental rates and less promotional discounting 
during the fourth quarter of  there was a rapid decline in our occupancy levels 
this reduction coincided with a reduction in call volume into our national telephone reservation center that we believe was attributable to the absence of any significant promotional discounts offered to tenants as well as to general economic conditions 
in addition  during this time frame we also experienced unusually high levels of move out activity 

although we were very pleased with the rental growth experienced in fiscal  we were very concerned about the sudden and rapid decline in our occupancy levels experienced in the fourth quarter of and into fiscal during the first quarter of  we reversed this strategy  and significantly reduced rental rates charged to new incoming tenants and began a national television advertising campaign that offered a significant promotional discount to new move ins 
the campaign resulted in increased move in activity during april and may compared to the same period in the prior year and helped us improve occupancy levels 
may through july are seasonally high rental activity months  accordingly  in the middle of may we terminated the advertising campaign and discontinued promotional discounts 
unfortunately  we underestimated the weakness in demand and in the absence of significant promotional discounts  rental activity during june and july decreased as compared to the same periods in consequently  our average occupancy levels for the consistent group of facilities again began to decline relative to the occupancies experienced in beginning in mid august  we reinstated a promotional discount program and advertised on television in selected markets in an effort to enhance move in activity and improve occupancy levels 
as a result  occupancy levels began to improve over the remainder of at december   our average occupancy was as compared to at december   and although the reduction was only the occupancy level was still well below our expectations 
the programs that we implemented in to increase the occupancy level came with significant costs 
promotional discounts increased from approximately  in to  in  resulting in a negative impact to our rental income 
while occupancy was improving in the year  our average occupancy levels for were still lower than the average occupancy levels for and as a result our revenues decreased in as compared to during  we continued advertising on television and expanded promotional discounts to new incoming tenants 
in addition  during the first half of we reduced rental rates charged to new incoming tenants in many of our markets to stimulate move in activity 
these actions had a positive impact  as our average occupancy level for the consistent group was for as compared to for  representing an increase of 
the increase in the occupancy level during also came at a significant cost 
promotional discounts totaled  for as compared to  for  resulting in a significant negative impact to our rental income 
in addition  television advertising cost for was  as compared to  in as indicated in the table above  rental income for our consistent group increased in as compared to this increase was primarily due to a increase in the weighted average occupancy in compared to combined with increased late charge and administrative fees  partially offset by a decrease in realized annualized rent per square foot of 
by the end of  we had attained our goal of reestablishing our occupancy levels to historical levels 
in addition  the improvement in occupancy levels enabled us to begin to increase rent rates that we charge to new tenants  which as of december  were higher than at the same time in more importantly  throughout we experienced positive year over year trends in the growth of our quarterly revpar  resulting in improvements in the growth trends of our rental income 
for the consistent group  during rental income for the first quarter decreased  for the second quarter increased  for the third quarter increased and for the fourth quarter increased  all compared to the same periods in the growth in rental income during will depend on various factors  among which will be our ability to stabilize and maintain high occupancy levels  increase rental rates charged to new and existing tenants  and stabilize or reduce the level of promotional discounts given to attract new tenants 
despite our occupancy gains  our expectations are significantly moderated by our experience that on average approximately to of our new customers will move out within the first to days of their move in date 
our current occupancy levels have been achieved in large part by the elevated move in activity experienced over the past three quarters 
our elevated level of move outs has made it more important to continue to generate a high level of move ins in order to maintain occupancy levels 
we have not been able to demonstrate that we can generate the high level of move ins necessary to sustain high occupancy levels without the use of media and or promotional discounts 
accordingly  we expect to remain aggressive with promotional and media programs at least through the first half of and  as a result  the up front costs of these marketing activities  and the increases in promotional discounts  are expected to continue to adversely impact our rental income 
we are working towards a goal of a high level of sustainable occupancy  characterized by a less volatile tenant base that is not as heavily weighted towards recent move ins  thereby mitigating the level of move outs 
if we can achieve this goal  it will allow for fewer promotional discounts and a reduction in advertising and other customer acquisition costs 
in furtherance of these goals  we are continuously evaluating our call volume  reservation activity  and move in move out rates for each of our markets relative to our marketing activities and rental rates 
in addition  we are evaluating market supply and demand factors and based upon these analyses we are continuing to adjust our marketing activities 
there can be no assurance that we will achieve our goals 
total operating expenses for the consistent group increased for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in this increase was primarily due to increases in payroll  advertising and promotion  property tax  repairs and maintenance costs and property insurance 
direct property payroll increased due primarily to increased incentives paid to and hours worked by property operating personnel 
advertising and promotion increased primarily due to an increase in television advertising from million during to million in repairs and maintenance have increased during as compared to due to costs to remedy mold issues in several facilities in southern states  increased snow removal expenses  as well as a general increase in costs to address deferred maintenance at our facilities 
property insurance increased due to an increase in the company s self insured portion of its risk 
with respect to our consistent group  we expect that the increase in repairs and maintenance expense experienced in will continue in  as we continue to address maintenance at our facilities and improve their rent ready condition and curb appeal 
payroll and property management costs will also continue to increase in  though not at the same growth rate experienced in due to higher staffing levels and higher compensation 
we also expect that property taxes will increase approximately in as compared to the following table sets forth our rental income  cost of television advertising  promotional discounts given  and average occupancies for each of the quarters in  and for the quarter ended march june september december entire year amounts in thousands total rental income promotional discounts given total cost of operations television advertising revpar weighted average realized annual rent per occupied square foot weighted average occupancy levels for the period the following table sets forth regional trends in our consistent group of facilities with respect to rental income  cost of operations  net operating income  weighted average occupancy levels  and realized rent per net rentable square foot

self storage operations expansion facilities throughout the three year period ended december   we expanded self storage facilities or converted them to facilities that combine both traditional self storage and containerized storage at the same location 
these activities caused a drop in revenue levels  as existing capacity was made unavailable in order to accommodate construction activities

we believe that the newly developed self storage facilities have been affected by the operating trends in occupancy and realized rents noted above with respect to the consistent group of facilities 
in addition  move in discounts  which increased significantly in and  have had a more pronounced effect upon realized rates for the newly developed facilities  because such facilities tend to have a higher ratio of newer tenants 
during  the developed self storage facilities had a weighted average occupancy level of approximately  as compared to in and in property operating expenses are substantially fixed  consisting primarily of payroll  property taxes  utilities  and marketing costs 
the rental revenue of a newly developed facility will generally not cover its property operating expenses excluding depreciation until the facility has reach an occupancy level of approximately to 
however  at that occupancy level  the rental revenues from the facility are still not sufficient to cover related depreciation expense and cost of capital with respect to the facility s development cost 
during construction of the self storage facility  we capitalize interest costs and include such cost as part of the overall development cost of the facility 
once the facility is opened for operations interest is no longer capitalized 
due to the relationship between the generation of rental income and immediate recognition of expenses upon opening of a facility  our development activities have had a negative impact on our net income 
the yield on development cost for these facilities for the year ended december   based on net operating income before depreciation  was approximately  which is lower than our ultimate yield expectations 
we expect these yields to improve significantly as these facilities continue to increase their occupancy levels and rental income 
this improvement in yield will be a source of earnings growth in future years 
we continue to develop facilities  despite the short term earnings dilution experienced during the fill up period  because we believe that the ultimate returns on developed facilities are favorable 
in addition  we believe that it is advantageous for us to continue to expand our asset base and benefit from the resulting increased critical mass  with facilities that will improve our portfolio s overall average construction and location quality 
we expect that over at least the next months  the developed self storage facilities will continue to have a negative impact to our earnings 
furthermore  the expansion and newly developed facilities in our development pipeline described in liquidity and capital resources acquisition and development of facilities that will be opened for operation over the next months will also negatively impact our earnings until they reach a stabilized occupancy level 
commercial property operations commercial property operations included in our consolidated financial statements include commercial space owned by the company and entities consolidated by the company 
we have a much larger interest in commercial properties through our ownership interest in psb 
our investment in psb is accounted for on the equity method of accounting  and accordingly our share of psb s earnings is reflected as equity in earnings of real estate entities  see below 
our commercial operations are comprised of  net rentable commercial space operated at certain of the self storage facilities and three stand alone commercial facilities having a total of  net rentable square feet

containerized storage operations in august  public storage pickup delivery pspud  a subsidiary of the company  made its initial entry into the containerized storage business through its acquisition of a single facility operator located in irvine  california 
at december   pspud had facilities that had been opened between and either through development or leasing of facilities

during  an asset impairment charge was recorded in the amount of  with respect to machinery and equipment of the containerized storage facilities because such equipment was no longer required 
facility lease expense decreased from  in to  in  principally due to moving operations from leased facilities to wholly owned facilities  and thus eliminating the lease expense paid to third parties as well as discontinuing operations at leased facilities 
this process was completed in at december   six of the containerized storage facilities are leased from third parties 
the remaining facilities were operated in facilities owned by the company  comprised of combination facilities with an aggregate of  square feet of industrial space this square footage is a component of the total net rentable square footage of the expansion facilities and the developed facilities in the table above and five industrial facilities having an aggregate of  net rentable square feet 
the containerized storage operations may continue to adversely impact our future earnings and cash flows

equity in earnings of real estate entities in addition to our ownership of equity interests in psb  we had general and limited partnership interests in seven limited partnerships at december  psb and the limited partnerships are collectively referred to as the unconsolidated entities 
due to our limited ownership interest and limited control of these entities  we do not consolidate the accounts of these entities for financial reporting purposes  and account for such investments using the equity method

on january   we acquired the remaining ownership interest in the development joint venture for cash totaling approximately  as a result  we began consolidating the operating results of the development joint venture and no further equity in earnings will be recorded with respect to this entity for periods after january  effective january  see note to the financial statements  we began consolidating the operating results of two other partnerships and no longer record equity in these entity s earnings with respect to our investments in these partnerships 
our earnings with respect our interests in these entities are included in the table above in the line disposed investments 
no further equity in earnings will be recorded with respect to these entities for periods after their respective dates of consolidation or disposal 
the other investments includes our equity in earnings with respect to our pro rata share of earnings with respect to seven limited partnerships  for which we held an approximately consistent level of equity interest during the three years ended december  the company formed these limited partnerships during the s 
the company is the general partner in each limited partnership  and manages each of these facilities for a management fee that is included in interest and other income 
the limited partners consist of numerous individual investors  including the company  which throughout the s acquired units of limited partnership interests in these limited partnerships in various transactions 
our future earnings with respect to the other investments will be dependent upon the operating results of the self storage facilities that these entities own 
the operating characteristics of these facilities are similar to those of the company s self storage facilities  and are subject to the same operational issues as the consistent group of self storage facilities as discussed above with respect to self storage operations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for the operating results of these entities for the years ended december  and other income and expense items interest and other income interest in other income includes i the net operating results from our third party property management operations  ii the net operating results from our merchandise sales and consumer truck rentals and iii interest income 
interest and other income remained constant in as compared to  reflecting the impact of improved operating results from our merchandise sales and consumer truck rentals  offset by lower interest income attributable to lower average interest rates on short term cash investments and principal payments received on notes receivable 
interest and other income has decreased in as compared to principally as a result of lower cash balances invested in interest bearing accounts  lower interest rates  and the reduction in income generated from affiliated entities that were acquired by the company 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense was  in   in  and  in included in depreciation expense with respect to our real estate facilities was  in   in  and  in  the increases are due to the acquisition and development of additional real estate facilities in through depreciation expense with respect to other assets  primarily depreciation of equipment and containers associated with the containerized storage operations  was  in   in  and  in amortization expense with respect to intangible assets totaled  for the years ended december  and  respectively  and  for the year ended december  depreciation and amortization during with respect to real estate facilities acquired or developed during amounted to  which was for a partial period for the time they were acquired until december   and we expect the annual depreciation expense with respect to these facilities for and forward will approximate  general and administrative expense general and administrative expense was  in   in  and  in general and administrative costs for each year principally consist of state income taxes  investor relation expenses  and corporate and executive salaries 
in addition  general and administrative expense includes expenses that vary depending upon the company s activity levels in certain areas  such as overhead associated with the acquisition and development of real estate facilities  employee severance  and product research and development expenditures 
the increase in general and administrative expense from to is primarily due to higher stock based compensation expense 
included in general and administrative expense for is  with respect to stock based compensation expense  including  in stock option expense   in restricted stock expense  and  in payroll taxes and other costs associated with employees exercise of  stock options in stock based compensation expense totaled  for  which is comprised of  in stock option expense and  in payroll taxes and other costs associated with employees exercise of  stock options during restricted stock expense  based upon restricted stock units outstanding and the market price of our common stock at december   should approximate  in  while stock option expense should approximate  in  exclusive of payroll taxes on exercises of options 
future grants of restricted stock units and stock options could further increase our future stock based compensation expense 
the future level of payroll taxes and other costs associated with employees exercise of stock options will depend upon the timing of employees exercise of approximately  stock options outstanding at december   the company s stock price at the time of exercise  and the level of future grants of stock options 
general and administrative expense decreased in as compared to  due primarily to a reduction in expenditures for product research  development overhead  consulting fees  lease termination costs relating to our pspud business  and employee severance costs  all of which totaled  in interest expense interest expense was  in   in  and  in debt and related interest expense remain relatively low compared to our overall asset base 
the decrease in interest expense in compared to and is principally the result of lower average debt balances  offset partially by decreased capitalized interest due to lower average in process development balances 
capitalized interest expense totaled  in   in  and  in in connection with our development activities 
interest paid  including capitalized interest  was  in   in  and  in we expect that our aggregate interest cost interest expensed and capitalized interest combined during fiscal will continue to decline as a result of principal amortization 
during fiscal  scheduled principal amortization approximates million  of which approximately million should be paid in the first half of in  we expect that our average in process development balances will exceed our average debt balances  and therefore we believe that virtually all of our interest will be capitalized in accordingly  we expect that interest expense  net of capitalization  will be nominal

in november  we formed a development joint venture the consolidated development joint venture with a joint venture partner whose partners include an institutional investor and the company s chairman and former ceo  b 
wayne hughes mr

the consolidated development joint venture is funded solely with equity capital consisting of from the company and from the joint venture partner 
included in minority interest in income for the years ended december    and is   and  respectively  representing our joint venture partner s pro rata interest in the operations of the consolidated development joint venture 
the facilities in the entity are newly developed facilities that are all in the fill up phase 
the increase in minority interest in income in and as compared to the preceding years with respect to the consolidated development joint venture is due to the opening and fill up of the facilities owned by this entity 
we expect that such minority interest in income will continue to increase during as the facilities continue to fill up and increase the earnings of this entity 
newly consolidated partnerships reflect the minority interests in two partnerships that we began consolidating effective january   as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  as described in note  during we recorded the pending sale of a partnership interest in the newly consolidated partnerships  and for all periods following the sale of this interest  income will be allocated to these interests 
the acquired minority interests reflect interests in the consolidated entities that the company acquired as of december  and are therefore no longer outstanding 
there will be no further income allocated to these interests in and beyond 
other minority interests reflect income allocated to minority interests that have maintained a consistent level of interest throughout the three years ended december   comprised of investments in the consolidated entities and the operating partnership units described in note to the company s financial statements 
the level of income allocated to these interests in the future is dependent upon the operating results of the storage facilities that these entities own  as well as any acquisitions of minority interests that the company does in the future 
discontinued operations as described more fully in the note to the consolidated financial statements  during and we implemented a business plan that included the closure of of the containerized storage facilities that were open at december  these facilities are referred to hereinafter as the closed facilities 
also  in  we sold five self storage facilities the sold self storage facilities  and in we sold one of our commercial facilities the sold commercial property to a third party 
during  in connection primarily with the closure or planned closure of of the closed facilities  we recorded asset impairment losses with respect to the containers and equipment utilized by these facilities totaling  in  we recorded impairment charges on assets for nine closed facilities of  and a  impairment charge on a real estate facility previously used by the containerized storage business  as well as an additional  loss upon sale of this real estate facility 
during  lease termination costs  representing the expected remaining lease liability following closure of the facilities  were accrued in the amount of  for in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no

such lease termination accruals would have been approximately  in the year ended december  the historical operations of the aforementioned facilities including the asset impairment losses and lease termination costs are classified as discontinued operations  with the rental income  cost of operations  and depreciation expense with respect to these facilities for current and prior periods included in the line item discontinued operations on the consolidated income statement

d the net discontinued operations have resulted in an increase in our earnings per share of per diluted common share for and reductions to our earnings per share of and per diluted common share for each of the two years ended december  and  respectively 
six of the closed facilities are in the process of closing which may take up to several months to complete 
we expect that these facilities will continue to generate operating losses until final closure 
gain loss in disposition of real estate in the year ended december   we recorded a net gain on disposition of real estate assets of  as compared to a loss of  in and a gain of  in the gain in is composed of a gain on sale of investments of  and a gain on sale of seven parcels of land and two self storage facilities aggregating  the net loss in is composed of a loss on disposition of land and a commercial facility totaling  as described in note  combined with a loss on disposition of partnership interests in the amount of  as described in note the gain in is related to the disposition of two real estate facilities and a parcel of land 
liquidity and capital resources we believe that our internally generated net cash provided by operating activities will continue to be sufficient to enable us to meet our operating expenses  capital improvements  debt service requirements and distributions to shareholders for the foreseeable future 
operating as a real estate investment trust reit  our ability to retain cash flow for reinvestment is restricted 
in order for us to maintain our reit status  a substantial portion of our operating cash flow must be used to make distributions to our shareholders see requirement to pay distributions below 
however  despite the significant distribution requirements  we have been able to retain a significant amount of our operating cash flow 
the following table summarizes our ability to fund distributions to the minority interest  capital improvements to maintain our facilities  and distributions to our shareholders through the use of cash provided by operating activities 
the remaining cash flow generated is available to make both scheduled and optional principal payments on debt and for reinvestment

our financial profile is characterized by a low level of debt to total capitalization  increasing net income  increasing cash flow from operations  and a conservative dividend payout ratio with respect to the common stock 
we expect to fund our growth strategies with cash on hand at december   internally generated retained cash flows  and proceeds from issuing equity securities 
in general  our current strategy is to continue to finance our growth with permanent capital  either common or preferred equity 
we have in the past used our million line of credit as temporary bridge financing  and repaid those amounts with internally generated cash flows and proceeds from the placement of permanent capital 
as of december   we had no outstanding borrowings under our million bank line of credit  which matures on october  we are currently in the process of amending this credit facility to provide for  among other items  an extension of the maturity date and enhancement to certain covenants 
over the past three years we have funded substantially all of our acquisitions with permanent capital both common and preferred securities 
we have elected to use preferred securities as a form of leverage despite the fact that the dividend rates of our preferred securities exceed the prevailing market interest rates on conventional debt 
we have chosen this method of financing for the following reasons i under the reit structure  a significant amount of operating cash flow needs to be distributed to our shareholders making it difficult to repay debt with operating cash flow alone  ii our perpetual preferred stock has no sinking fund requirement  or maturity date and does not require redemption  all of which eliminate any future refinancing risks  iii after the end of a non call period  we have the option to redeem the preferred stock at any time  which in   and enabled us to effectively refinance higher coupon preferred stock with new preferred stock at lower rates  iv preferred stock does not contain onerous covenants  thus allowing us to maintain significant financial flexibility  and v dividends on the preferred stock can be applied to our reit distribution requirements 
our credit ratings on each of our series of cumulative preferred stock by each of the three major credit agencies are baa by moody s and bbb by both standard poor s and fitch ibca 
our portfolio of real estate facilities remains substantially unencumbered 
at december   we had mortgage debt outstanding of million which encumbers facilities with a book value of million and unsecured debt in the amount of million 
we believe that our size and financial flexibility enables us to access capital when appropriate

during  approximately million of preferred securities become redeemable  at our option  having a weighted average rate of 
it is our intent to redeem these securities with lower rate preferred securities 
as indicated above  we recently issued preferred securities with a rate of 
there is no assurance that rates will continue at these historical low levels 
we may  during the course of  issued preferred stock in anticipation of the aforementioned redemptions 
requirement to pay distributions we have operated  and intend to continue to operate  in such a manner as to qualify as a reit under the internal revenue code of  but no assurance can be given that we will at all times so qualify 
to the extent that the company continues to qualify as a reit  we will not be taxed  with certain limited exceptions  on the taxable income that is distributed to our shareholders  provided that at least of our taxable income is so distributed to our shareholders prior to filing of the company s tax return 
we have satisfied the reit distribution requirement since aggregate dividends paid during totaled million to the holders of our cumulative preferred stock  million to the holders of our common stock and million to the holders of our equity stock  series a 
although we have not finalized the calculation of our taxable income  we believe that the aggregate dividends paid in to our shareholders enabled us to continue to qualify as a reit 
we estimate that the distribution requirements for fiscal with respect to our cumulative preferred stock outstanding  and assuming the redemption of cumulative preferred stock  series k  will be approximately million 
during  we paid distributions totaling million with respect to our preferred partnership units 
we estimate the annual distributions requirements with respect to the preferred partnership units outstanding at december  to be approximately million 
for  distributions with respect to the common stock and equity stock  series a will be determined based upon our reit distribution requirements after taking into consideration distributions to the preferred shareholders 
we anticipate that  at a minimum  quarterly distributions per common share will remain at per common share 
for the first quarter of  our board of directors has declared a quarterly distribution of per common share 
with respect to the depositary shares of equity stock  series a  we have no obligation to pay distributions if no distributions are paid to the common shareholders 
to the extent that we do pay common distributions in any year  the holders of the depositary shares receive annual distributions equal to the lesser of i five times the per share dividend on the common stock or ii 
the depositary shares are non cumulative  and have no preference over our common stock either as to dividends or in liquidation 
capital improvement requirements during  we have budgeted approximately million for capital improvements 
capital improvements include major repairs or replacements to the facilities that keep the facilities in good operation condition and maintain their visual appeal 
capital improvements do not include costs relating to the development or expansion of facilities 
debt service requirements we do not believe we have any significant refinancing risks with respect to our mortgage debt  all of which is fixed rate 
at december   we had total outstanding notes payable of approximately million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for approximate principal maturities of such borrowings 
we anticipate that our retained operating cash flow will continue to be sufficient to enable us to make scheduled principal payments 
it is our current intent to fully amortize our debt as opposed to refinance debt maturities with additional debt 
acquisition and development of facilities no facilities were acquired from third parties during during  we acquired nine self storage facilities for approximately million 
our low level of third party acquisitions over the past two years is not indicative of either the supply of facilities offered for sale or our ability to finance the acquisitions  but is primarily due to prices sought by sellers and our lack of desire to pay such prices 
during  we will continue to seek to acquire additional self storage facilities from third parties  however  it is difficult to estimate the amount of third party acquisitions we will undertake 
during  we acquired through a merger all of the remaining limited partnership interest not currently owned by the company in ps partners iv  ltd  a partnership that is consolidated with the company 
the acquisition cost was approximately  consisting of the issuance of  shares of our common stock  valued at the closing trading price of the shares at the date of the acquisition  and cash of approximately  this acquisition had the effect of reducing minority interest by  with the excess of cost over underlying book value  allocated to real estate 
in june  we anticipate that we will acquire a limited partnership interest in one of our consolidated entities 
our estimate of the acquisition cost is approximately million 
in november  we formed a second joint venture partnership for the development of approximately million of self storage facilities 
the venture is funded solely with equity capital consisting of from us and from the joint venture partner 
the term of the joint venture is years 
after six years  the joint venture partner has the right to cause the company to purchase the joint venture partner s interest for an amount necessary to provide them with a maximum return of or less in certain circumstances 
our estimate of the purchase price of this interest is approximately million 
on january   we entered into a joint venture with an institutional investor for the purpose of acquiring up to million of existing self storage properties in the united states from third parties 
the venture will be funded entirely with equity consisting of from the company and from the institutional investor 
the venture has a nine month investment period through september to identify and acquire facilities 
to date no facilities have been acquired by the venture 
we currently have a development pipeline of self storage facilities and expansions to existing self storage facilities with an aggregate estimated cost of approximately million unaudited 
approximately million of development cost has been incurred as of december  we have acquired the land for of these projects  which have an aggregate estimated cost of approximately million unaudited  and costs incurred as of december  of approximately million 
the remaining five facilities represent identified sites where we have an agreement in place to acquire the land  generally within one year 
we anticipate that the development cost of these projects will be funded solely by the company 
the development and fill up of these storage facilities is subject to significant contingencies such as obtaining appropriate governmental approvals 
we estimate that the amount remaining to be spent of approximately million will be incurred over the next months
