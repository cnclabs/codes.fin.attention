sales in the period were million compared with million reported in the quarter

these items total approximately million on a pretax basis 
exclusive of these items  the company would have reported a small net profit for the quarter 
reduced sg a expenses  a smaller increase in the provision for doubtful accounts and higher technical group operating profits were primarily responsible for the improved results 
lower sg a expenses were the direct result of the company s restructuring initiatives carried out over the last three years while the technical group s improved profitability over the prior year reflects a increase in sales and higher gross margins 
the telecommunications services operation remains profitable and achieved a increase in operating profits over prior year in spite of a reduction in sales due to lower overhead costs and higher gross margin percentages

on a pro forma basis  the fourth quarter loss of million or per diluted share would compare with a net loss of million or per diluted share for the same period in consistent with the full year discussion  the driving force of the reduction in operating profits was the company s telecommunications services business unit  which represented the majority of the decline 
the company  however  did experience a slowdown in late december in its technical group  which it attributed to budget issues and plant shutdowns at two major customers 
in early  the work at those customers has returned to normal levels 
outlook it is management s expectation that the company will be profitable in the company s growth prospects are influenced by broad economic trends 
the pace of customer capital spending programs  new product launches and similar activities have a direct impact on the need for temporary and permanent employees 
according to the staffing industry report  the staffing services industry fundamentals are improving  with revenue growth forecasted to rise in to billion and in to billion 
management believes that the company is pursuing a more focused business strategy  and should be able to capitalize on the improving staffing services market 
the company has reorganized its business over the past three years to reduce costs and achieve greater efficiencies in operation by pursuing a growth strategy focusing on key customer needs 
it is management s belief that such a strategy provides butler with an opportunity to improve performance without increasing capital expenditures  adding new resources or new fixed overhead 
growth will be dependent upon the spending of the company s key customers spending returning to more normalized levels and an increase in butler s share of the business 
the company also believes that as a result of its restructuring activities  the negative impact of adverse economic trends has been lessened 
should the united states economy continue to decline during  the company s operating performance could be adversely impacted 
further declines in the economy could result in the need for future cost reductions  change in strategy and capital infusion 
additionally  changes in government regulations could result in prohibition or restriction of certain types of employment services or the imposition of new or additional benefits  licensing or tax requirements with respect to the provision of employment services that may reduce butler s future earnings 
there can be no assurance that butler will be able to increase the fees charged to its clients in a timely manner and in a sufficient amount to cover increased costs as a result of any of the foregoing 
the staffing services industry is very competitive and highly fragmented 
there are limited barriers to entry and new competitors frequently enter the market 
a significant number of its competitors are financially stronger than the company 
the company competes in national  regional and local markets with numerous temporary staffing and permanent placement companies including a number of national and regional consulting firms that offer employment staffing services 
local employment staffing firms are typically operator owned  and each market generally has one or more such competitors 
price competition in the staffing industry is significant  particularly for the provision of office and light industrial personnel  and pricing pressures from competitors and customers are increasing 
butler expects that the level of competition will remain high in the future  which could limit butler s ability to maintain or increase its market shares or profitability 
accounting changes change in accounting for goodwill and certain other intangibles effective january   the company adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets not be amortized  but be tested for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level 
an impairment charge will be recognized only when the implied fair value of a reporting unit  including goodwill  is less than its carrying amount 
accordingly  the company ceased amortization of all goodwill upon adoption 
the company performed the transitional goodwill impairment test 
the company determined the implied fair value of each of its reporting units using a discounted cash flow analysis and compared such values to the respective reporting units carrying amounts 
this evaluation indicated that goodwill recorded in the technology solutions segment was impaired as of january  the primary factor resulting in the impairment charge was the continuing difficult economic environment in the information technology sector

change in accounting for derivative instruments as of january   the company adopted sfas no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities  subsequently amended by sfas no 
and sfas no 
sfas  as amended  establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
it requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value 
changes in the fair value of those instruments will be reported in earnings or other comprehensive income depending on the use of the derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting 
the accounting for gains and losses associated with changes in the fair value of the derivative and the effect on the consolidated financial statements will depend on its hedge designation and whether the hedge is highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in the fair value of cash flows of the asset or liability hedged 
as a result of adopting sfas no 
as amended  and in accordance with the transition provisions  the company recorded unrealized loss of approximately  net of tax benefit of approximately  to accumulated other comprehensive income

liquidity and capital resources at december  and  the company had cash of approximately million and million  respectively  and working capital of approximately million and million  respectively 
the improvement in working capital was primarily due to the classification of the company s revolving credit facility as a current liability in see discussion below 
excluding the revolving credit facility  working capital would have been million at december  accounts receivable as measured in days sales outstanding dso have remained consistent at approximately dso for  and as of december  and  the company had approximately million and million  respectively  of borrowings committed outstanding balance plus letters of credit under its revolving credit facility with general electric capital corporation gecc  leaving approximately million and million  respectively  of availability 
the company also has two term loans with gecc 
the december  and balances outstanding under gecc term loan a were million and million  respectively  and under term loan b were million for each year 
the company funds its operations primarily with cash generated by operations and borrowings under its existing revolving credit facility with gecc 
revenue and gross margin levels affect operating cash flow and any deterioration in the company s performance on these financial measures would have a negative impact on the company s liquidity 
the company s cash balances are restricted in that daily cash collected from customers is deposited into accounts controlled by gecc and is transferred to pay down its borrowings 
the company s cash requirements are funded daily by gecc provided there are available funds 
this arrangement combined with loan terms that allows gecc to declare the loan in default on a subjective basis requires that the revolving credit facility be classified as a current liability  notwithstanding the term of the agreement  in accordance with financial accounting standards board s emerging issues task force issue number  balance sheet classification of borrowings outstanding under revolving credit agreements that include both a subjective acceleration clause and a lock box arrangement eitf no 

as a result  the company has restated its consolidated balance sheet as of december  to reclassify million of borrowings under its revolving credit facility  which were previously reported as long term debt  to a current liability in accordance with the guidance contained in eitf no 
at the company s request  gecc has subsequently amended the credit facility to contain only objectively measured terms of default  thereby  allowing the outstanding balance of the company s revolving credit facility to be classified as long term at december  when the business has generated excess cash  the company has borrowed under the revolving credit facility to pay down the term loans 
the ability to borrow under the existing revolving credit facility depends on the amount of eligible collateral  which  in turn  depends on certain advance rates applied to the value of accounts receivables 
management anticipates that the existing resources and working capital should be sufficient to satisfy the company s foreseeable cash requirements 
of course  there can be no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct 
moreover  it should be noted that a continuation of losses would require the company to seek alternative or additional financing sources 
there can be no assurance that any additional financing or other sources of capital will be available on acceptable terms or at all 
the inability to obtain additional financing  if needed  would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations

critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts  including  but not limited to  receivable valuations  impairment of goodwill  pension benefit obligations  income taxes  restructuring costs and litigation accruals 
management s estimates are based on historical experience  facts and circumstances available at the time  and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the company reviews these matters and reflects changes in estimates as appropriate 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
outlined below are accounting policies  which are important to the company s financial position and results of operations  and require significant judgments and estimates on the part of management 
for a summary of all of the company s significant accounting policies  including the accounting policies discussed below  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company s revenue recognition policies comply with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
approximately of revenue is generated from time and material contracts where there is a signed agreement or approved purchase order in place that specifies the fixed hourly rate and other reimbursable costs to be billed based on direct labor hours incurred 
revenue is recognized on these contracts based on direct labor hours incurred 
fixed price contracts are primarily contracts to provide services related to installation and testing of equipment and for services performed by engineers 
these contracts fall within the scope of statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
accordingly  revenues from fixed priced contracts are recognized on the percentage of completion method  measured by the percentage of services direct labor hours incurred to date to estimated total services direct labor hours for each contract 
this method is used as expended direct labor hours are considered to be the best available measure of progress on these contracts 
losses on fixed prices contracts are recognized during the period in which the loss first becomes apparent based upon estimating the cost to complete as determined by experience 
allowance for doubtful accounts and notes the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
the company reviews a customer s credit history before extending credit 
the company establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts and notes based upon factors surrounding the credit risk of specific customers  historical trends and other information 
the company has demonstrated the ability to make reasonable and reliable estimates  however  if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
goodwill goodwill represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying net assets of acquired companies and had been amortized through december  on a straight line basis over the expected period to be benefited but not more than years 
effective january   the company adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
and as a result  goodwill is no longer being amortized but tested for impairment 
goodwill is tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
an impairment charge will be recognized only when the implied fair value of a reporting unit  including goodwill  is less than its carrying amount 
accordingly in  the company ceased amortization of all goodwill and performed the transitional goodwill impairment test 
the company determined the implied fair value of each of its reporting units using a discounted cash flow analysis and compared such values to the respective reporting units carrying amounts 
this evaluation indicated that goodwill recorded in the technology solutions segment was impaired as of january  the primary factor resulting in the impairment charge was the continuing difficult economic environment in the information technology sector 
accordingly  the company recognized a non cash charge of approximately  net of tax benefit of approximately  recorded as of january   as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for the write down of goodwill to its fair value 
on june   the company performed its annual goodwill impairment test and determined that there was additional impairment of the goodwill recorded in the technology solution segment 
accordingly  the company recognized a non cash charge of approximately million 
in assessing the recoverability of goodwill  projections regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors are made to determine the fair value of the respective reporting unit 
if these estimates or related projections change in the future  there may be a need to record additional impairment charges for goodwill 
litigation accruals the company is currently involved in certain legal proceedings and  as required  has accrued its estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of these claims 
this estimate has been developed in consultation with outside counsel and is based upon an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
predicting the outcome of claims and litigation  and estimating related costs and exposure involves substantial uncertainties that could cause actual costs to vary materially from estimates 
income taxes the breadth of the company s operations and the complexity of tax regulations require assessments of uncertainties and judgments in estimating the ultimate taxes the company will pay 
the final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors  including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions  outcomes of tax litigation and resolution of proposed assessments arising from federal and state tax audits 
the company believes it has adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters 
significant judgment is also required in evaluating the need for and magnitude of appropriate valuation allowances against deferred tax assets 
deferred tax assets are regularly reviewed for recoverability 
the realization of these assets is dependent on generating future taxable income  as well as successful implementation of various tax planning strategies 
if the company were unable to generate sufficient future taxable income  or if there is a material change in the actual effective tax rates or time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible  the company could be required to establish a valuation allowance against all or a portion of the deferred tax assets  thus resulting in an increase in the effective tax rate and an adverse impact on the company s financial position and results of operations 
pension benefit plan actuarial assumptions the company s pension benefit obligations and related costs are calculated using actuarial concepts within the framework of sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  and sfas no 
 employers accounting for settlements and curtailment of defined benefit pension plans and for termination benefits 
two critical assumptions  the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets  are important elements of expense and or liability measurement 
management evaluates these critical assumptions annually 
other assumptions involve demographic factors such as retirement  mortality  turnover and rate of compensation increases 
the discount rate enables the company to state expected future cash flow as a present value on the measurement date 
the guideline for setting this rate is a high quality long term corporate bond rate 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense 
management reduced the discount rate to in from in to reflect market interest rate conditions 
a one percentage point decrease increase in the assumed discount rate would increase decrease the projected benefit obligation by or approximately  and increase decrease the net periodic pension cost by approximately  to determine the expected long term rate of return on the plan assets  management considered the current and expected asset allocation  as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class 
a lower expected rate of return on pension plan assets would increase pension expense 
the long term expected rate of return on plan assets was and in and  respectively 
a one percentage point increase decrease in the long term return on pension asset assumption means the net periodic pension cost would decrease increase by of the pension benefit obligation or approximately  restructuring and other related costs in order to consolidate operations  downsize and improve operating efficiencies  the company has recorded restructuring charges 
the recognition of restructuring charges requires estimates and judgments regarding employee termination benefits and other exit costs to be incurred when the restructuring actions take place 
actual results can vary from these estimates  which results in adjustments in the period of the change in estimate 
recently issued financial accounting standards in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no  consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 
fin 
fin requires that a variable interest entity vie be consolidated when a company is subject to the majority of the risk of loss from the vie s activities or is entitled to receive the majority of the entity s residual returns  or both

adoption of fin r is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated results of operations and financial position
