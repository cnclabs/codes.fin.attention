item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of such forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties  including those set forth in item of this report under the caption risks relating to our business  and other reports we file with the securities and exchange commission 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements 
overview we provide services primarily to providers  payors  government agencies  pharmaceutical  biogenetic  and other healthcare organizations in north america  europe  and asia 
we generate substantially all of our revenues from fees for information technology outsourcing services  and professional services 
we typically bill for our services on an hourly  fixed fee  or monthly fixed fee basis as specified by the agreement with a particular client 
for services billed on an hourly basis  in our consulting and systems integration businesses csi  composed of our healthcare and life sciences business units  fees are determined by multiplying the amount of time expended on each assignment by the project hourly rate for the consultant s assigned to the engagement 
fixed fees  including outsourcing fees  are established on a per assignment or monthly basis and are based on several factors such as the size  scope  complexity and duration of an assignment  the number of our employees required to complete the assignment  and the volume of transactions or interactions 
revenues are generally recognized related to the level of services performed  the amount of cost incurred on the assignment versus the estimated total cost to complete the assignment  or on a straight line basis over the period of performance of service 
additionally  we have recently been licensing an increased amount of our software products  generally in conjunction with the customization and implementation of such software products 
revenues from our software licensing were greater than of our total revenues in fiscal year  and we expect our software licensing revenues to grow in absolute dollars during our fiscal year 
provisions are made for estimated uncollectible amounts based on our historical experience 
we may obtain payment in advance of providing services 
these advances are recorded as customer advances and reflected as a liability on our balance sheet 
out of pocket expenses billed and reimbursed by clients are included in total revenues  and then deducted to determine net revenues 
for purposes of analysis  all percentages in this discussion are stated as a percentage of net revenues  since we believe that this is the more relevant measure of our business 
cost of services primarily consists of the salaries  bonuses  and related benefits of client serving consultants and outsourcing associates  and subcontractor expenses 
selling expenses primarily consist of the salaries  benefits  travel  and other costs of our sales force  as well as marketing and market research expenses 
general and administrative expenses primarily consist of the costs attributable to the support of our client serving professionals such as non billable travel  office space occupancy  information systems  salaries and expenses for executive management  financial accounting and administrative personnel  expenses for firm and business unit governance meetings  recruiting fees  professional development and training  and legal and other professional services 
as associate related costs are relatively fixed in the short term  variations in our revenues and operating results in our csi business can occur as a result of variations in billing margins and utilization rates of our billable associates 
our most significant expenses are our human resource and related salary and benefit expenses 
as of december   approximately  of our  employees are billable consultants 
another employees are part of our outsourcing business 
the salaries and benefits of such billable consultants and outsourcing related employees are recognized in our cost of services 
most non billable employee salaries and benefits are recognized as a component of either selling or general and administrative expenses 
approximately of our workforce  or employees  are classified as non billable 
our cost of services as a percentage of revenues is directly related to several factors  including  but not limited to our consultant utilization  which is the ratio of total billable hours to available hours in a given period  the amount and timing of cost incurred  our ability to control costs on our outsourcing projects  the billed rate on time and material contracts  and the estimated cost to complete our non outsourcing fixed price contracts 
we evaluate our non outsourcing fixed price contracts on an ongoing basis by estimating the cost to complete the assignment 
we then recognize revenues to achieve a constant margin over the remaining term of the engagement 
we have changed our accounting for outsourcing contracts with the adoption of eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  in the first quarter of under our outsourcing contracts  a significant portion of our revenues are fixed and allocated over the contract on a straight line basis  as we are required to provide a specified level of services subject to certain performance measurements 
also  certain revenues may fluctuate under the contracts based on the volume of transactions we process or other measurements of service provided 
if we incur higher costs to provide the required services or receive less revenue due to reduced transaction volumes or penalties associated with service level failures  our gross profit can be negatively impacted 
in our csi business  we manage consultant utilization by monitoring assignment requirements and timetables  available and required skills  and available consultant hours per week and per month 
differences in personnel utilization rates can result from variations in the amount of non billed time  which has historically consisted of training time  vacation time  time lost to illness and inclement weather  and unassigned time 
non billed time also includes time devoted to other necessary and productive activities such as sales support and interviewing prospective employees 
unassigned time results from differences in the timing of the completion of an existing assignment and the beginning of a new assignment 
in order to reduce and limit unassigned time  we actively manage personnel utilization by monitoring and projecting estimated engagement start and completion dates and matching consultant availability with current and projected client requirements 
the number of consultants staffed on an assignment will vary according to the size  complexity  duration  and demands of the assignment 
assignment terminations  completions  inclement weather  and scheduling delays may result in periods in which consultants are not optimally utilized 
an unanticipated termination of a significant assignment or an overall lengthening of the sales cycle could result in a higher than expected number of unassigned consultants and could cause us to experience lower margins 
in addition  entry into new market areas and the hiring of consultants in advance of client assignments have resulted and may continue to result in periods of lower consultant utilization 
in response to competition and continued pricing and rate pressures  we have recently implemented a global sourcing strategy into our business operations  which includes the deployment of offshore resources as well as resources that perform services remote from the client site 
we have also begun to incorporate larger numbers of variable cost or per diem staff in some of our projects 
we expect these strategies to result in improved cost of services through a combination of lower cost attributable to offshore resources and higher leverage of resources that perform services offsite or on a variable cost basis 
to the extent we pass through reduced costs to our clients related to offshore resources  the global sourcing strategy may result in lower revenues on a per engagement basis 
however  we expect to offset this potential revenue impact with improved competitive positioning in our markets 
several of our competitors employ both global sourcing and variable staffing strategies to provide software development and other information technology services to their clients  while at the same time reducing their cost structure and improving the quality of services they provide 
if we are unable to realize the perceived cost benefits of our recently implemented strategies or if we are unable to receive high quality services from foreign employees  variable staff employees or subcontractors  our business may be adversely impacted and we may not be able to compete effectively 
comparison of the years ended december  and december  revenues 
our net revenues increased to million for the year ended december   an increase of from million for the year ended december  our total revenues increased to million for the year ended december   an increase of from million for the year ended december  approximately million of the increase was primarily due to revenues generated by our acquired companies and another million due to the full year impact of two outsourcing contracts that began in mid and revenue from another outsourcing contract which began in late these increases were offset by a significant decline in our life sciences business unit s revenues excluding revenues generated from the paragon solutions  inc acquisition  which was caused by the completion of a significant engagement in mid and by several other contracts that concluded throughout as a result of the decline in the custom software development market for life science businesses 
we are addressing the market shift by enhancing our firstdoc suite of software products  so that the level of necessary custom software development for our clients is reduced 
additionally  in the healthcare business unit  we have not been able to replace expiring health plan contracts and have thus experienced a decline in these revenues as well 
if we are unable to obtain new engagements and or additional work  we could see a further decline in revenues for both the life sciences and the healthcare business units in cost of services 
cost of services before reimbursable expenses increased to million for the year ended december   an increase of from million for the year ended december  approximately million of the increase is due to the costs of services from our recent acquisitions and another million from the new outsourcing contracts  offset by a reduction in staff primarily in our life sciences business unit 
gross profit 
gross profit decreased to million for the year ended december   a decrease of from million for the year ended december  the decrease is primarily due to the change in our revenue mix from life sciences and healthcare to outsourcing  which generally earns a lower gross profit 
this decrease is also attributable to the rapid revenue decline in life sciences  and the delay in personnel reductions when the significant life sciences engagement and several smaller healthcare engagements were completed as discussed above 
further  we believe our gross profit in outsourcing was negatively impacted to a small degree by our implementation of eitf see critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition and unbilled receivables 
offsetting these declines was million of gross profit generated by our acquisitions 
gross profit  as a percentage of net revenues  decreased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december   due to the factors discussed above 
selling expenses 
selling expenses decreased to million for the year ended december   a decrease of from million for the year ended december  the decrease is primarily due to reductions in our sales force offset by the selling expenses of million which were incurred by paragon 
selling expenses  as a percentage of net revenues  decreased slightly from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december   an increase of from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to general and administrative expenses from our acquired companies of million  as well as investments in software product development and related technologies in life sciences and in the patient safety institute 
general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of net revenues  increased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  a combination of acquisition integration initiatives and other cost reductions reduced our general and administrative expenses substantially in the last quarter of the year  and we expect our general and administrative expenses to decline in restructuring  severance  and impairment costs 
restructuring  severance  and impairment costs were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  restructuring  severance  and impairment costs for the year ended december  included approximately million of severance costs related to staff reductions and million for facility downsizing and fixed asset write downs 
interest income  net 
interest income  net of interest expenses  increased slightly to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  interest income  net of interest expense  as a percentage of net revenues  increased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  other expenses  net 
other expenses decreased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  due primarily to the buy out of our minority interest partners in fcg management services  llc resulting in the elimination of this expense as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of fiscal year further  we purchased the remaining minority interest in fcg infrastructure services  inc in january  and as a result  we will incur minimal minority interest expense in the fiscal year 
income taxes 
our provision for taxes for the year ended december  of million consisted of a tax benefit of million related to our million of pretax losses  offset by a deferred tax asset valuation allowance of million taken due to the uncertainty of our ability to realize the full amount of our deferred tax assets see critical accounting policies and estimates deferred income taxes 
the benefit rate of  excluding the valuation allowance  compared to a provision rate for the year ended december  of 
the benefit rate in fiscal year was lower than the provision rate in the prior year due to the existence of certain non deductible expenses 
comparison of the years ended december  and december  revenues 
our net revenues increased to million for the year ended december   an increase of from million for the year ended december  the increase was due to two new outsourcing engagements that commenced in the second quarter of offset by a decline in our healthcare and life sciences work resulting from increased competition and difficult market conditions 
our total revenues decreased to million for the year ended december   a decrease of from million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to lower reimbursable expenses for our healthcare and life sciences businesses resulting from the declines in their revenues  which require the most travel 
partially offsetting this decline is the increase in net revenues 
cost of services 
cost of services increased to million for the year ended december   an increase of from million for the year ended december  the increase was attributable to an increase in the outsourcing staff and subcontractors related to additional outsourcing contracts  partially offset by a decline in the number of consultants in the healthcare and life sciences business units 
in the outsourcing business  we employ a major subcontractor on three of our largest contracts 
revenues related to the major subcontracting relationships were million and million for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
gross profit 
gross profit decreased to million for the year ended december   a decrease of from million for the year ended december  this was due to a significant shift in revenue mix from our healthcare and life sciences business units to our outsourcing business unit  which is at a lower margin 
gross profit as a percentage of net revenues decreased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  our gross profit percentage in healthcare and life sciences increased from to due to improved consultant utilization and lower revenue writedowns  while our outsourcing gross profit percentage declined from to due to the higher proportion of subcontractor revenues within our outsourcing revenues 
selling expenses 
selling expenses decreased to million for the year ended december   a decrease of from million for the year ended december  due to staff and cost reductions 
selling expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million for the year ended december   a decrease of from million for the year ended december   due to cost reductions and the elimination of million of goodwill amortization 
additionally  fiscal year general and administrative expense included a million bad debt writeoff 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december   due to the reduction in costs 
restructuring  severance  and impairment charges 
restructuring  severance  and impairment charges were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  restructuring  severance  and impairment charges for the year ended december  included approximately million of severance costs related to a reduction in staff of approximately people  and approximately million related to facility downsizing 
restructuring  severance  and impairment charges for the year ended december  consisted of million of severance costs  approximately million related to facility downsizing  and million for the impairment of goodwill related to the restructuring of our technology services group within our healthcare business unit 
interest income  net 
interest income  net of interest expense  decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  despite our invested cash balances being somewhat higher  interest income was reduced due to lower interest rates 
interest income net of interest expense as a percentage of net revenues decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  other expense  net 
other expense decreased slightly to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  income taxes 
the provision for income taxes was for the year ended december   compared to a benefit reported for the year ended december  the benefit rate in the prior year was reduced due to the nondeductibility of a portion of the goodwill impairment taken in that year 
quarterly financial results the following tables set forth certain unaudited statements of operations data for the eight quarters ended december   as well as such data expressed as a percentage of our net revenues for the periods indicated 
this data has been derived from unaudited financial statements that  in the opinion of our management  include all adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of such information when read in conjunction with our annual audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto

our quarterly operating results may vary significantly in the future depending on a number of factors  many of which are outside our control 
these factors may include  but are not limited to the reduction in size  delay in commencement  interruption  or termination of one or more significant engagements or assignments  fluctuations in consultant hiring and utilization  the use of offsite and offshore resources on our engagements  the ability to incorporate use of variable labor staffing into our projects  the loss of key personnel and other employees  the loss of one or more significant clients in any of our business segments  the unpredictability of engaging new clients and additional assignments from existing clients  increased competition and pricing pressures  timing and collection of fees and payments  write offs of client billings  consolidation of  and subsequent reduction in the number of  healthcare providers  the number  timing  and contractual terms of significant client engagements  fluctuations in market demand for our services  consultant hiring  and utilization  delays or increased expenses incurred in connection with existing assignments  variations in the timing of expenses  changes in pricing policies by us or our competitors  changes in our business strategies  variability in the number of business days within a quarter  the timing of certain general and administrative expenses  and international currency fluctuations 
due to the foregoing factors  quarterly revenues and operating results are not predictable with any significant degree of accuracy 
in particular  the timing between initial client contract and fulfillment of the criteria necessary for revenue recognition can be lengthy and unpredictable  and revenues in any given quarter can be materially adversely affected as a result of such unpredictability 
business practices of clients  such as deferring commitments on new assignments until after the end of fiscal periods  could require us to maintain a significant number of under utilized consultants  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
we typically experience a lower number of billable days in certain quarters of the year  particularly the fourth quarter when many of our employees typically take vacation during the december holidays 
in fiscal year  we will have an extra week in the fourth quarter due to our fiscal calendar 
variability in the number of billable days may also result from other factors such as vacation days  sick time  paid and unpaid leave  inclement weather  and holidays  all of which could produce variability in our revenues and costs 
in the event of any downturn in potential clients businesses or the economy in general  planned utilization of our services may be deferred or canceled  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
based on the preceding factors  we may experience a shortfall in revenues or earnings from expected levels or otherwise fail to meet expectations of securities analysts or the market in general  which could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
liquidity and capital resources during the year ended december   we generated cash flow from operations of million 
during the year ended december   we used approximately million to acquire three companies see note i of the notes to consolidated financial statements and million of cash to purchase property and equipment  primarily computer and related equipment 
we also used million to purchase the minority interest that the university of pennsylvania health system had in fcg management services  llc 
at december   we had cash and marketable investments available for sale of million  compared to million at december  we have a revolving line of credit  under which we are allowed to borrow up to million at an interest rate of the prevailing prime rate with an expiration of may  there was no outstanding balance under the line of credit at december  due to our net loss at december   we are out of compliance with certain bank covenants contained in the line of credit agreement 
however  we received a waiver for such non compliance subsequent to our fiscal year end 
on october   we entered into an unsecured loan agreement with white plains hospital center requiring us to provide interest free financing of up to million if our system implementation at the hospital results in an increase in the hospital s accounts receivable balance or days outstanding during a day period following the completion of the system implementation 
any amounts borrowed during this day period are payable days after the borrowing date 
we do not currently expect to make any loans under this agreement until early  if at all 
since our loans are unsecured  we cannot guarantee that the hospital will repay our loans on a timely basis  if at all 
if our loans are not repaid or repaid in a timely manner  our financial condition would be impacted negatively 
on february   we purchased  shares of common stock and  in the money options from david s 
lipson  a member of our board of directors  for a total purchase price of million 
in connection with the transaction  mr 
lipson resigned from our board of directors and repaid indebtedness to us of  our net cash payment to mr 
lipson in the transaction was million 
as of december   the following table summarizes our contractual and other commitments in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years after years operating leases  net of subleases     purchase obligations total     management believes that our existing cash and investments  together with funds generated from operations  will be sufficient to meet operating requirements for at least the next twelve months 
our cash and investments are available for capital expenditures which are projected at approximately million for  strategic investments  mergers and acquisitions  and other potential large scale cash needs that may arise  including million in cash that was paid on january  to purchase the remaining minority interest in fcg infrastructure services  inc formerly codigent solutions group  inc that we did not already own 
critical accounting policies and estimates the foregoing discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  cost to complete client engagements  valuation of goodwill and long lived and intangible assets  accrued liabilities  income taxes  restructuring costs  idle facilities  litigation and disputes  and the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
our actual results may differ from our estimates and we do not assume any obligation to update any forward looking information 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition  accounts receivable  and unbilled receivables revenues are derived primarily from information technology outsourcing services  consulting  and systems integration 
revenues are recognized on a time and materials  level of effort  percentage of completion  or straight line basis 
before revenues are recognized  the following four criteria must be met a persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  b delivery has occurred or services rendered  c the fee is fixed and determinable  and d collectibility is reasonably assured 
we determine if the fee is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured based on our judgments regarding the nature of the fee charged for services rendered and products delivered and the collectibility of those fees 
arrangements range in length from less than one year to seven years 
the longer term arrangements are generally level of effort or fixed price arrangements 
revenues from time and materials arrangements are generally recognized based upon contracted hourly billing rates as the work progresses 
revenues from level of effort arrangements are recognized based upon a fixed price for the level of resources provided 
revenues from fixed fee arrangements for consulting and systems integration work are generally recognized on a rate per hour or percentage of completion basis 
we maintain  for each of our fixed fee contracts  estimates of total revenue and cost over the contract term 
for purposes of periodic financial reporting on the fixed price consulting and system integration contracts  we accumulate total actual costs incurred to date under the contract 
the ratio of those actual costs to our then current estimate of total costs for the life of the contract is then applied to our then current estimate of total revenues for the life of the contract to determine the portion of total estimated revenues that should be recognized 
we follow this method because reasonably dependable estimates of the revenues and costs applicable to various stages of a contract can be made 
revenues recognized on fixed price consulting and system integration contracts are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion 
if we do not accurately estimate the resources required or the scope of the work to be performed  do not complete our projects within the planned periods of time  or do not satisfy our obligations under the contracts  then profit may be significantly and negatively affected or losses may need to be recognized 
revisions in our contract estimates are reflected in the period in which the determination is made that facts and circumstances dictate a change of estimate 
favorable changes in estimates result in additional revenues recognized  and unfavorable changes in estimates result in a reduction of recognized revenues 
provisions for estimated losses on individual contracts are made in the period in which the loss first becomes known 
some contracts include incentives for achieving either schedule targets  cost targets  or other defined goals 
revenues from incentive type arrangements are recognized when it is probable they will be earned 
as of the beginning of fiscal year  we adopted eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  which addresses how to account for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services  and or rights to use assets 
revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables are divided into separate units of accounting if the deliverables in the arrangement meet the following criteria the delivered item has value to the customer on a stand alone basis  there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of undelivered items  and delivery of any undelivered item is probable 
arrangement consideration is allocated among the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values  with the amount allocated to the delivered item being limited to the amount that is not contingent on the delivery of additional items or meeting other specified performance conditions 
we have created separate units of accounting on our existing outsourcing contracts based on the above criteria and will evaluate each future contract based on the same criteria 
generally  we have separated certain elements of our initial contract stages  where new systems are implemented and or processes are reengineered into a new operating environment  from the ongoing operations of the contract 
the primary impact of the adoption of this standard is that our ongoing contract operations  which constitute the vast majority of the revenues from outsourcing contracts  are now recorded on a straight line basis over the life of the contract instead of on a percentage of completion basis in proportion to costs incurred 
in general  we will report lower margins on existing contracts in the early years of a contract and anticipate reporting increased margins in the later years of a contract  however  no assurances can be made in that regard 
the new method is no longer based on a consistent gross profit over the life of a contract 
we will likely experience greater volatility of outsourcing earnings as contract revenues remain level and contract costs move up or down  or shift from one quarter to another 
on certain contracts  or elements of contracts  costs are incurred subsequent to the signing of the contract  but prior to the rendering of service and associated recognition of revenue 
where such costs are incurred and realization of those costs is either paid for upfront or guaranteed by the contract  those costs are deferred and later expensed over the period of recognition of the related revenue 
at december   we had deferred  of such deferred costs 
as part of our on going operations to provide services to our customers  incidental expenses  which are generally reimbursable under the terms of the contracts  are billed to customers 
these expenses are recorded as both revenues and direct cost of services in accordance with the provisions of eitf  income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred  and include expenses such as airfare  mileage  hotel stays  out of town meals  and telecommunication charges 
unbilled receivables represent revenues recognized for services performed that were not billed at the balance sheet date 
the majority of these amounts are billed in the subsequent month 
unbillable amounts arising from contracts occur when revenues recognized exceed allowable billings in accordance with the contractual agreements 
as of december   we had unbillable revenues included in current unbilled receivables of approximately million  which were generally expected to be billed in the following year 
in addition  we had a long term account receivable at december   and december  of million and million  respectively  on a single major outsourcing contract with a term of seven years 
the long term receivable will be billed and collected over the remaining three years of the contract through contractual billings that will exceed the amounts to be earned as revenues 
customer advances are comprised of payments from customers for which services have not yet been performed or prepayments against work in process 
these unearned revenues are deferred and recognized as future contract costs are incurred and as contract services are rendered 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our clients to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our clients were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
management analyzes account receivables and historical bad debt  customer concentrations  credit worthiness  past collection experience  current economic trends  and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of doubtful accounts 
deferred income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns 
our net deferred tax assets have historically consisted primarily of the tax benefit related to restructuring costs for facility closures  supplemental executive retirement plan contributions  and other accrued liabilities such as accrued vacation pay  which are not deductible for tax purposes until paid 
during fiscal year  we have generated additional deferred tax assets for net operating loss carryforwards which were created by our pretax losses combined with the fact that we are outside the period it is allowable to carry back losses  and also for additional deferred tax assets related to the cumulative effect of our change in revenue recognition method on our outsourcing contracts 
we use significant estimates in determining what portion of our deferred tax asset is more likely than not to be realized 
based on those estimates and taking into account our recent history of cumulative losses  we recorded a valuation allowance of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year together with a full valuation allowance of million we had already taken against the net operating loss carryforwards of companies we had acquired earlier in the year  we have a valuation allowance of million against a total deferred tax asset of million 
based on our belief that it is more likely than not that future taxable income will be sufficient to realize the remaining million of deferred tax assets  we have not recorded a valuation allowance against those assets 
however  there is no guarantee that our taxable income will be sufficient to realize such remaining net deferred tax assets  and we will continue to evaluate the potential need for an additional valuation allowance on an ongoing basis 
additionally  if the realization of a greater amount of our deferred tax assets in the future is considered more likely than not  we will reverse all or a portion of the existing valuation allowance at that time 
goodwill and intangible assets under sfas no  we no longer amortize our goodwill and are required to complete an annual impairment testing during the fourth quarter of each year 
we believe that the accounting assumptions and estimates related to the annual goodwill impairment testing are critical because these can change from period to period 
the impairment test requires us to forecast our future cash flows  which involves significant judgment 
our operating results have been negatively impacted by the worldwide economic conditions 
accordingly  if our expectations of future operating results change  or if there are changes to other assumptions  our estimate of the fair value of our reporting units could change significantly resulting in a goodwill impairment charge  which could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
as of december   we have million of goodwill and million of intangible assets recorded on our balance sheet see note a of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
recent accounting pronouncements see note a of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion on recent accounting pronouncements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents ie  short term and long term cash investments  accounts receivable  unbilled receivables  accounts payable  and a revolving line of credit 
only the cash and cash equivalents which totaled million at december  present us with market risk exposure resulting primarily from changes in interest rates 
based on this balance  a change of one percent in the interest rate would cause a change in interest income for the annual period of approximately million 
our objective in maintaining these investments is the flexibility obtained in having cash available for payment of accrued liabilities and acquisitions 
our borrowings are primarily dependent upon the prevailing prime rate 
as of december   we had no borrowings under our revolving line of credit and an available borrowing capacity of million 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
the estimated fair value of borrowings under the revolving line is expected to approximate its carrying value
