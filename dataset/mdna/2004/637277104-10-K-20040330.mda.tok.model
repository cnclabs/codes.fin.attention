executive overview in the company reduced its net loss from million or per share in to million or per share  increased its revenues  generated cash from operating activities  and improved production efficiencies while virtually eliminating its debt and reducing its inventories to their lowest levels in nearly five years 
management believes the company has strong momentum heading into the company started the year targeting quarterly improvements in gross margins to be achieved through reductions in price incentives  reduced warranty costs and various manufacturing efficiency gains 
indeed  the company went from a negative gross margin in the first quarter of as restated as further discussed in note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements to a positive gross margin in the fourth quarter a basis point improvement 
where began with a declining dealer body and a lowered market share position  the company finished the year with a growing dealer base and the biggest annual market share percent increase of any of the top nine class a manufacturers as reported by statistical survey  inc key to the company s improvement in were new and enhanced product offerings  and improving profit margins driven by various cost reduction and efficiency initiatives 
product development both the national rv nrv and country coach cci divisions released new products in the first quarter of at the nrv division  the tropi cal is a diesel product efficiently built on the same production line as the gas products 
at the country coach division  the inspire offers a new unit starting at a retail price of  attractively priced with unique electronics and a higher interior height  this product has been well received contributing to a increase in cci s production and an increased backlog of orders for the second half of in addition  cci s distribution channels were significantly increased in  thus improving access for its retail customers 
in evaluating existing products at the national rv division  the company set to work revitalizing its entry level gas sea breeze product and its already successful dolphin gas product 
these efforts resulted in a annual improvement in nrv s motorhome product turn  a annual increase in market share for the sea breeze  and an overall increase in demand and orders backlog for nrv products 
also re designed in was the country coach prevost conversion 
significant improvements have created demand for increased production into to meet this increased production  the company moved its prevost operation to a leased facility off site  resulting in additional manufacturing space for the growing inspire line

operating performance continual effort to increase the company s quality and decrease its warranty costs resulted in another million reduction in warranty costs in we experienced the same improvement in 
expressed as a percentage of net sales  warranty costs decreased by 
continued reductions are part of the strategy for other areas impacting the company s gross profit margins are increased facility utilization  decreased worker s compensation costs in california and improved production efficiencies 
both divisions have increased production bringing the company near capacity in the country coach facility and close to in the national rv facility as of year end 
as the company experiences better capacity utilization  the company should see additional improvement in gross margins for worker s compensation costs continue to be a challenge in california 
the company has undertaken significant safety programs to address these costs and the company is being more proactive in the handling of its claims 
while these measures are helping  the company may also be affected by pending state reforms which  if passed  should also further reduce workers compensation costs 
improved turn rates and a reduction in aged dealer lot inventories have played a key role in the overall performance improvement of the company from to as the new and revitalized products come on line  the company is seeing a rise in wholesale deliveries and improvement in the company s annual class a retail market share to in from in stronger product offerings and the resulting increase in demand have significantly reduced the need to discount the company s products 
looking ahead many of the same objectives the company addressed last year remain in place for the coming year 
aggressive product development  cost containment  and increased customer satisfaction are three of those objectives 
in the first quarter of  the country coach division debuted three of its new model year offerings  the inspire and the completely redesigned magna and custom affinity 
the remaining offerings for country coach and for national rv will be introduced during the summer  including nrv s newly redesigned tradewinds 
the company is continually trying to contain its costs specifically in the warranty cost and workers compensation cost areas 
the company has improved the quality of its motorhomes and thus lowered its warranty costs 
also  the company has instituted a number of safety programs aimed at reducing workers compensation costs 
the company has made further progress to contain its costs by initiating a lean manufacturing philosophy at its nrv facility 
the company is continually striving to improve its customer support by improving club support  telephone support for owners and dealers  and parts fulfillment 
the company utilizes various techniques such as surveys and focus groups to ensure that it is improving in the area of customer satisfaction 
another key initiative is enhanced training programs for the company s workforce  service centers  dealers  and consumers 
the company has already undertaken efforts in the areas of safety  and with new distance learning capabilities  the company is looking forward to broadcasting its training programs directly to dealers and service providers  driving the movement for increased customer satisfaction in areas of technical maintenance 
in addition  factory training programs are giving the company s customers a basis for self diagnostics and a better understanding of the equipment they are operating 
the outlook for the industry as a whole continues to be strong 
the recreational vehicle industry association s rvia market expansion campaign  go rving  now in its seventh year  is fostering greater awareness and garnering media attention 
this analysis of the company s financial condition and operating results should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements including the notes thereto 
critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses for each period 
the following represents a summary of the company s critical accounting policies  defined as those policies that the company believes are i the most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations  and ii that require the company s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
valuation of long lived assets 
the company reviews long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset might not be recoverable 
if indicators of impairment were present  the company would evaluate the carrying value of property and equipment  in relation to estimates of future undiscounted cash flows of the underlying business  which are based on judgment and assumptions 
warranty reserve 
the company s warranty reserve is established based on its best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date 
the company records an estimate for future warranty related costs based on recent actual warranty claims 
also  the company s recall reserve is established  as necessary  based on management s estimate of the cost per unit to remedy the problem and the estimated number of units that will ultimately be brought in for the repair 
while the company s warranty costs have historically been within its expectations and the provisions established  the company cannot guarantee that it will continue to experience the same warranty costs that it has in the past 
a significant increase in dealer shop rates  the cost of parts or the frequency of claims could have a material adverse impact on the company s operating results for the period or periods in which such claims or additional costs materialize 
revenue recognition 
the company recognizes revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  or sab sab requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred and title and the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer  iii the price is fixed and determinable  and iv collectibility is reasonably assured 
assuming that all of the above criteria were satisfied  motorhome and towable sales are recorded by the company when accepted by the dealer 
legal proceedings 
the company is currently involved in certain legal proceedings in the ordinary course of its business and has accrued its estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of these claims 
this estimate has been developed in consultation with counsel handling the company s defense in these matters and is based upon an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
deferred tax asset 
as of december   the company has recorded a deferred tax asset of million 
realization is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income prior to expiration of the loss carryforwards 
although realization is not assured  management believes it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax asset will be realized 
the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable however  could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced 
valuation of inventory 
inventory is valued at the lower of cost estimated using the first in  first out method or market 
the company periodically evaluates the carrying value of inventories and maintains an allowance for excess and obsolescence to adjust the carrying value as necessary to the lower of cost or market or to amounts on hand to meet expected demand in the near term 
unfavorable changes in estimates of obsolete inventory would result in an increase in the allowance and a decrease in gross profit 
workers compensation reserve 
the company s workers compensation reserve is established based on its best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing employee workers compensation claims as of the balance sheet date 
the company records an estimate for future workers compensation related costs based on historical workers compensation claims paid 
even though the company s workers compensation costs have been growing during the past several years  the company cannot provide assurance that these costs will continue at these levels  increase or decrease  in the near term 
a significant change in california workers compensation legislation  the cost of claims or the frequency of claims could have a material adverse impact on the company s operating results for the period or periods in which such claims or additional costs materialize

the company has suffered net losses of   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the company has provided cash from operations of  and used cash from operating activities of  and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the company has funded its financial needs primarily through operations and its existing line of credit 
at december   the company had cash and cash investments of  excluding restricted cash totaling million required to secure a letter of credit in connection with one of the company s insurance policies and working capital of  the company remains dependent upon its ability to obtain outside financing either through the issuance of additional shares of its common stock or through borrowings until it achieves sustained profitability through a combination of increased sales and improved product margins 
during  the company financed its operations primarily through its existing working capital and a million asset backed revolving line of credit with ups capital corporation upsc 
on december   the company had working capital of million compared to million at december  this decrease of million was primarily due to a million decrease in inventory and a million decrease in income taxes receivable  partially offset by a million increase in accounts receivable  the million elimination of the line of credit borrowings  a million increase in cash and a million increase in current deferred income taxes

as of december   the company had short term debt of  in addition  the company has an asset based revolving credit facility of million with ups capital corporation upsc 
this credit facility expires august the company has reserved million from the line of credit for one month s rent on the cci facility 
the remaining million was available for general corporate working capital needs and capital expenditures 
the company was able to provide alternative security  in the form of state workers compensation fund insurance  for its nrv self insured workers compensation program starting in july this allowed for the removal of the letter of credit that secured the self insured workers compensation program and freed up million of the line of credit 
amounts borrowed under the revolving credit facility bear interest at the prime rate listed in the wall street journal plus percentage points 
the credit facility contains  among other provisions  certain financial covenants  including net worth requirements 
at december   the company had no outstanding loans under the line of credit and the company was not in default with any covenants of its loan agreement with upsc 
management started a number of initiatives during to improve its profitability and its working capital position 
the primary issues addressed were i excess inventories  ii product development  iii improved quality and iv improved manufacturing efficiencies 
the company took concerted efforts in to reduce inventories and better manage production to avoid inventory buildups 
the company also focused on its product development efforts in which resulted in improved product turn rates and increased retail market share 
the company was able to reduce warranty costs  by million during during each of the last two quarters of  the company increased production at its perris  california facility by approximately 
this was achieved with minimal increase in work in process inventory 
at the junction city  oregon facility  production increased by approximately in the second half of  related primarily to the introduction of the inspire 
management is focused on continuing to improve upon certain initiatives including i further reduction of warranty costs  ii increased facility utilization and iii a reduction of workers compensation costs at its perris  california facility 
the company believes the combination of internally generated funds  working capital  and unused borrowing availability will be sufficient to meet the company s planned capital and operational requirements for at least the next months 
should the company require further capital resources during  it would most likely address such requirement through a combination of sales of its products  sales of equity securities  and or additional debt financings 
if circumstances changed  and additional capital was needed  no assurance can be given that the company would be able to obtain such additional capital resources 
if unexpected events occur requiring the company to obtain additional capital and it is unable to do so  it then might attempt to preserve its available resources by deferring the creation or satisfaction of various commitments  deferring the introduction of various products or entry into various markets  or otherwise scaling back its operations 
if the company were unable to raise such additional capital or defer certain costs as described above  such inability would have an adverse effect on the financial position  results of operations  cash flows and prospects of the company 
the following is a schedule as of december  of the company s known contractual obligations for the periods presented below 
in thousands less than after contractual obligations total year years years years debt operating leases    letter of credit wells fargo 
as further discussed in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  the company generally agrees with its dealers lenders to repurchase any unsold rvs in the event of various circumstances 
the company s maximum potential exposure under these agreements approximated million at december effects of inflation management does not believe that inflation has had a significant impact on the company s results of operations for the periods presented 
recent accounting pronouncements in december the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition 
sab codifies  revises and rescinds certain sections of sab no 
in order to make this interpretive guidance consistent with current authoritative accounting and auditing guidance and sec regulations 
accordingly  there is no impact to the company s results of operations  financial position or cash flows as a result of the issuance of sab no 
factors that may affect future operating results potential fluctuations in operating results 
the company s net sales  gross margin and operating results may fluctuate significantly from period to period due to factors such as the mix of products sold  the level of discounting employed on the company s products  the ability to utilize or expand manufacturing resources efficiently  material shortages  the introduction and consumer acceptance of new models offered by the company  competition  warranty expense  the addition or loss of dealers  the timing of trade shows and rallies  and factors affecting the recreational vehicle industry as a whole  such as cyclicality and seasonality 
in addition  the company s overall gross margin will be impacted by shifts in the company s product 
due to the relatively high selling prices of many of the company s motorhome models in particular  its highline class a motor coaches  a relatively small variation in the number of recreational vehicles sold in any quarter can have a significant effect on sales and operating results for that quarter 
continuation of losses 
the company has had net losses totaling million and million for and  respectively 
continued losses could reduce the company s liquidity and cause the company to reduce its expenditures on capital improvements  machinery and equipment  and research and development 
this could have a negative effect on the company s ability to maintain production schedules  manufacture products of high quality  and develop and manufacture new products that will achieve market acceptance 
this could in turn  have a negative impact on the company s sales and earnings 
if the company continues to suffer losses  the company could be unable to implement its business and financial strategies or meet its obligations when due 
the company s losses in and were mainly caused by i excess manufacturing capacity and related fixed costs caused by continued low production levels  ii continued significant discounting to wholesale distributors in and the first half of  iii the recognition of the complete impairment of the company s goodwill in  iv high warranty costs in and v a workers compensation reserve increase in and continued high workers compensation costs in in spite of a profitable fourth quarter in  there are no assurances that the conditions that have resulted in the company s losses in and will not continue through and beyond 
cyclicality  seasonality and economic conditions 
the rv industry has been characterized by cycles of growth and contraction in consumer demand  reflecting prevailing economic conditions  which affect disposable income for leisure time activities 
concerns about the availability and price of gasoline  decreases in consumer confidence  increases in interest rates and reductions in available financing have had  and may in the future have  an adverse impact on rv sales 
seasonal factors  over which the company has no control  also have an effect on the demand for the company s products 
demand in the rv industry declines over the winter season  while sales are generally highest during the spring and summer months 
dependence on certain dealers and concentration of dealers in certain regions 
for the year ended december   three dealers accounted for   and respectively  of the company s annual net sales 
also  the company s top ten dealers accounted for approximately  and of the company s annual net sales during the years ended december   and  respectively 
the loss by the company of one or more of these dealers could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  a significant portion of the company s sales is from dealers located in states in the western part of the united states 
consequently  a general downturn in economic conditions or other material events in such region could materially adversely affect the company s sales 
dependence on chassis suppliers 
one of the principal components used in the manufacture of motorhomes is the chassis  which includes the engine  drive train and other operating components 
although country coach manufactures chassis used in its products  the company obtains the required chassis for its nrv class a motorhomes from a limited number of manufacturers 
as is standard in the industry  arrangements with such suppliers permit them to terminate their relationship with the company at any time 
lead times for the delivery of chassis frequently exceed five weeks and the rv industry as a whole has from time to time experienced temporary shortages of chassis 
the company s outside chassis suppliers accounted for approximately of the total chassis purchased or manufactured during if any of the company s suppliers were to discontinue the manufacture of chassis utilized by the company in the manufacture of its class a motorhomes  materially reduce their availability to the rv industry in general or limit or terminate their availability to the company in particular  the business and financial condition of the company could be materially and adversely affected 
potential liabilities under repurchase agreements 
as is customary in the industry  the company generally agrees with its dealers lenders to repurchase any unsold rvs in the event of various circumstances 
although the company s maximum potential exposure under these agreements approximated million at december   as with accounts receivable  the risk of loss was spread over numerous dealers and lenders and was further reduced by the resale value of the rvs which the company would be required to repurchase 
losses under these agreements have not been material in the past and management does not believe that any future losses under such agreements will have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
competition 
the company competes with numerous manufacturers  many of which have multiple product lines of rvs  which are larger and have substantially greater financial and other resources than the company 
according to statistical surveys  inc  the three largest motorhome manufacturers had sales aggregating of industry wide retail unit sales of class a motorhomes for the year ended december  in addition  sales of used rvs provide competition to rv manufacturers 
government regulation 
the company is subject to federal  state and local regulations governing the manufacture and sale of their products  including the provisions of the national traffic and motor vehicle safety act the motor vehicle act  the transportation recall enhancement  accountability and documentation act the tread act and the federal motor vehicle safety standards fmvss 
certain states require approval of coach designs and provide certification tags proving compliance before coaches can be sold into that state 
the motor vehicle act authorizes the national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa to require a manufacturer to recall and repair vehicles that contain safety defects or fail to comply with the fmvss 
in addition  the company has  from time to time  instituted voluntary recalls of certain motorhome and towable units 
future recalls of the company s products  if any  could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company is also subject to some federal and state consumer protection and unfair trade practice laws and regulations relating to the sale  transportation and marketing of motor vehicles  including so called lemon laws 
federal and state laws and regulations also impose upon vehicle operators various restrictions on the weight  length and width of motor vehicles  including trucks and motorhomes  that may be operated in certain jurisdictions or on certain roadways 
as a result of these restrictions  certain models of motorhomes manufactured by the company s country coach subsidiary may not be legally operated in certain jurisdictions or on certain roadways 
certain jurisdictions also prohibit the sale of vehicles exceeding length restrictions 
enforcement of these laws and related customer complaints to date has been limited 
the company is unable to predict reliably the extent of future enforcement of these laws  the extent future enforcement might lead to customer complaints  or the extent to which country coach may choose or be required to provide some customer remedy  such as repurchasing or exchanging motorhomes  as a result of such complaints 
if current enforcement efforts and related complaints were to increase significantly from their current levels  the cost of resolving such complaints  particularly should the resolution of complaints require repurchasing  refurbishing  and reselling of motorhomes  could have a material adverse financial effect on the company 
amendments and changes in enforcement with respect to these laws and regulations and the implementation of new laws and regulations could significantly increase the costs of manufacturing  purchasing  operating or selling the company s products and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the failure of the company to comply with these present or future laws or regulations could result in fines imposed on the company  civil and criminal liability  or suspension of operations  any of which could have a material adverse financial effect on the company 
the company s manufacturing operations are subject to a variety of federal and state environmental regulations relating to the use  generation  storage  treatment  emissions  and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes and noise pollution 
such laws and regulations are becoming more stringent  and it is likely that future amendments to these environmental statutes and additional regulations promulgated thereunder will be applicable to the company  its manufacturing operations and its products in the future 
the failure of the company to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines being imposed on the company  civil and criminal liability  suspension of operations  alterations to the manufacturing process or costly cleanup or capital expenditures 
warranty claims 
the company is subject to warranty claims in the ordinary course of its business 
although the company maintains reserves for such claims  which to date have been adequate  there can be no assurance that warranty expense levels will remain at current levels or that such reserves will continue to be adequate 
a large number of warranty claims exceeding the company s current warranty expense levels could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
product liability 
the company maintains product liability insurance with coverage in amounts which management believes is reasonable 
to date  the company has been successful in obtaining product liability insurance on terms the company considers acceptable 
given the nature of the company s business  product liability in excess of the company s insurance coverage  if incurred  could have a material adverse financial effect on the company 
antitakeover provisions 
certain provisions of the company s certificate of incorporation  as well as delaware corporate law and the company s stockholder rights plan the rights plan  may be deemed to have anti takeover effects and may delay  defer or prevent a takeover attempt that a stockholder might consider in its best interest 
such provisions also may adversely affect prevailing market prices for the common stock 
certain of such provisions allow the company s board of directors to issue  without additional stockholder approval  preferred stock having rights senior to those of the common stock 
in addition  the company is subject to the anti takeover provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law  which prohibits the company from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder  unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner 
in august  the company adopted the rights plan  pursuant to which holders of the common stock received a distribution of rights to purchase additional shares of common stock  which rights become exercisable upon the occurrence of certain events
