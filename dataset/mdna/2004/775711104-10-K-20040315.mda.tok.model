results of operations better worse as year ended december  compared to prior year in thousands revenues    cost of services provided    depreciation and amortization    sales  general and administrative    gain loss on sale of assets  n m n m interest income income before income taxes    provision for income taxes    net income    general operating comments the company s continued emphasis on customer retention  along with building recurring revenues  was the primary driver of revenue growth of in the fourth quarter and for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year periods  despite a sluggish economy and unseasonably wet and cold weather conditions in parts of the us in the first half of revenues were up in the first quarter  in the second quarter and in the third quarter as compared to the prior year periods 
the financial results for the fourth quarter and the twelve months ended december  were positively impacted by the continued benefit of our recent service initiatives  which included every other month residential pest control service  gold medal premium commercial pest control services  and termite directed liquid and baiting treatment

at december   orkin had franchises in total 
results of operations versus revenues for the year ended december  were million  an increase of million or from last year s revenues of million 
the company s revenue growth was very similar across its primary services  which are residential pest control  commercial pest control  and termite service 
the growth in pest control revenues for the year reflects growth in the customer base  better average selling prices  continued improvements in customer retention  and successful price increase campaigns 
every other month service  our primary residential pest control service offering  continues to grow in importance  comprising of our residential pest control customer base at december  in commercial pest control  the company continued to receive favorable reaction to the rollout of its premium gold medal service  which specifically targets food processing and manufacturing companies  and also achieved improvements in average prices on new sales and successful price increases from existing customers 
this past summer  orkin began test marketing a mosquito control program in the northern united states and canada 
while working to address the threat of mosquito borne diseases in the us  a highly successful west nile virus preventative program was also implemented in ontario  canada 
two provinces were provided thousands of larvicide treatments to mosquito breeding grounds reducing the population of adult mosquitoes and their eggs 
the company intends to expand the mosquito control program in canada and other us markets in the spring of as another sign of strengthening in the commercial market  the company achieved a monthly record high of sales to national accounts in september termite revenues increased in the fourth quarter as a result of higher new job completions and continued growth in recurring revenues from bait monitoring and renewal revenues  although termite revenues for the twelve months ended december  decreased slightly  mainly as a result of the unusually wet and cold weather in parts of the us in the first half of per the national climatic data center s years of tracking weather data  temperatures in the northeast region of the country were the th coldest on record  and the southeast experienced the second wettest six month period on record 
the company s foreign operations accounted for approximately of total revenues for the year ended december  the business of the company is affected by the seasonal nature of the company s pest and termite control services as evidenced by the following chart 
total net revenues first quarter    second quarter    third quarter    fourth quarter    cost of services provided for the year ended december  increased million or  although the expense margin expressed as a percentage of revenues improved by percentage points  representing of revenues for the year ended december  compared to of revenues in the prior year 
the dollar increase was mainly due to an increase in fleet expenses  as a result of higher fuel costs and a temporary spike in vehicle counts in the first quarter as the company transitioned to a new fleet agreement  and an increase in fringe benefit costs due to higher pension and group medical costs  partially offset by improvements in service salaries  administrative salaries  and materials and supplies 
service technician productivity and average pay continued to improve  which leads to better employee retention and  in management s opinion  improved customer retention 
sales  general and administrative for the year ended december  decreased million or and  as a percentage of revenues  improved by percentage points or  averaging of total revenues compared to for the prior year 
the improvement for the year was a result of the home office process improvement initiative started in  lower field administrative costs as a result of technology and organizational investments  lower sales payroll due to lower staffing and partly from the formation of in bound call centers  and lower bad debt expenses due to better collections and improvement in the receivables aging statistics 
these were partially offset by higher fringe benefit costs  advertising  and an increase in the summer sales program costs 
depreciation and amortization expenses for the year ended december  were million or lower than the prior year 
the decrease was due to certain technology assets becoming fully depreciated in the last twelve months 
the company had approximately million in capital expenditures during the year ended december  compared to million in in addition  the company realized a net gain of million from the sale or disposal of assets in the fourth quarter of the company s effective tax rate was for the periods prior to the fourth quarter of the effective tax rate was increased to in to reflect an increase in the effective state income tax rate for the year  as well as true up adjustments in the fourth quarter of approximately million 
as a result  the effective tax rate for the fourth quarter increased to 
results of operations versus revenues for the year ended december  increased to million  an increase of million or from revenues of million 
the company s foreign operations made up less than of the company s total revenues in and the revenue increase was mainly attributable to a modest increase in revenues from pest control services  as termite revenues were flat with the prior year 
the growth in pest control revenues reflects the beneficial impact of better customer retention and a successful residential summer sales program  factors that combined to produce a net gain in the customer base as well as higher average selling prices 
within the us  the company had an improvement in customer retention  a modest increase in new sales units and an overall improvement in average selling prices  resulting in a higher ending customer base at the end of the year 
every other month service  our primary residential pest control service offering  continued to grow in importance  comprising almost of our residential pest control customer base at the end of our commercial revenues grew  mainly as a result of better pricing on new sales  a successful price increase campaign for existing customers in  and the introduction of new products and services during the year 
although termite revenues were flat in as a result of a decrease in sales to new customers  the company experienced an improvement in recurring revenues mainly from enhanced renewal retention and higher bait monitoring services 
despite the decrease in termite sales dollars  the company managed to achieve a slight improvement in average selling prices 
cost of services provided for the year ended december  decreased  or and margins improved by percentage points  representing of revenues in compared to of revenues in the prior year 
improvement for the year ended december  can be mainly attributed to the company s recent service initiatives that have increased productivity  reduced headcount  and created other efficiencies and better asset utilization 
the company achieved reductions in service salaries  personnel related expenses  materials and supplies  travel and fleet expense  which were partially offset by slightly higher insurance and claims charges 
pest control and termite technician productivity improved  as did employee retention 
the company believes that better employee retention has a direct impact on customer retention 
better fleet management led to a decrease in the average number of vehicles and an improvement in revenues per vehicle 
sales  general and administrative for the year ended december  decreased million or  and improved by percentage points in  averaging of total revenues compared to for the prior year 
improvement for the year was mainly attributed to reduced personnel related expenses  fleet expense  telephone expense  travel expense  bad debt expense and sales promotions  partially offset by higher summer selling program expense and advertising expense 
depreciation and amortization expenses for the year ended december  were approximately million or higher than the prior year 
the increase was primarily due to the depreciation associated with focus  the company s new proprietary branch computer system 
the rollout of focus to the branches was completed in the fourth quarter of as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
 the amortization of goodwill has been discontinued as of january   causing a decrease in goodwill amortization expense of approximately million partially offset by an increase in amortization expense of million due to a change in the expected life of customer contracts 
the loss on sale of assets for the year ended december  of  was mainly due to the write off of obsolete field it equipment 
net income for the year ended december  includes the effects of adopting sfas no 
 which did not have a material impact on the company s overall results of operations 
in addition  if sfas no 
had been adopted in the year ended december   it would not have had a material impact on net income previously reported for the year ended december  the company s tax provision of million for the year ended december  reflects increased taxable income over the prior year

critical accounting policies we view critical accounting policies to be those policies that are very important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations  and that require management s most difficult  complex or subjective judgments 
the circumstances that make these judgments difficult or complex relate to the need for management to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we believe our critical accounting policies to be as follows accrual for termite contracts the company maintains an accrual for termite contracts representing the estimated costs of reapplications  repair claims  associated labor and chemicals  settlements  awards and other costs relative to termite control services performed prior to the balance sheet date 
the company contracts an independent third party actuary on an annual basis to provide the company an estimate of the liability based upon historical claims information for the largest portion of the accrual 
in addition  management estimates and accrues for costs outside the scope of the actuarial study including the estimated costs of retreatments  representing costs to be incurred that are estimatable at the balance sheet date  as well as liability and costs associated with claims in litigation 
the actuarial study and historical experience are major considerations in determining the accrual balance  along with management s knowledge of changes in business practices  contract changes  ongoing claims  and termite remediation trends 
the accrual is established based on all these factors 
management makes judgments utilizing these operational and other factors but recognizes that they are inherently subjective due to the difficulty in predicting settlements and awards 
other factors that may impact future cost include chemical life expectancy and government regulation 
it is significant that the actual number of claims has decreased in recent years due to changes in the company s business practices 
however  it is not possible to accurately predict future significant claims 
positive changes to our business practices include revisions made to our contracts  more effective treatment methods that include a directed liquid baiting program  more effective termiticides  and expanded training methods and techniques 
accrued insurance the company self insures  up to specified limits  certain risks related to general liability  workers compensation and vehicle liability 
the estimated costs of existing and future claims under the self insurance program are accrued based upon historical trends as incidents occur  whether reported or unreported although actual settlement of the claims may not be made until future periods and may be subsequently revised based on developments relating to such claims 
the company contracts an independent third party actuary on an annual basis to provide the company an estimated liability based upon historical claims information 
the actuarial study is a major consideration  along with management s knowledge of changes in business practices and existing claims compared to current balances 
the reserve is established based on all these factors 
management s judgment is inherently subjective and a number of factors are outside management s knowledge and control 
additionally  historical information is not always an accurate indication of future events 
it should be noted that the number of claims has been decreasing due to the company s proactive risk management to develop and maintain ongoing programs 
however  it is not possible to accurately predict future significant claims 
initiatives that have been implemented include pre employment screening and an annual motor vehicle report required on all its drivers  utilization of a global positioning system that has been fully deployed to our company vehicles  post offer physicals for new employees  and pre hire  random and post accident drug testing 
the company has improved the time required to report a claim by utilizing a red alert program that provides serious accident assessment twenty four hours a day and seven days a week and has instituted a modified duty program that enables employees to go back to work on a limited duty basis 
revenue recognition the company s revenue recognition policies are designed to recognize revenues at the time services are performed 
for certain revenue types  because of the timing of billing and the receipt of cash versus the timing of performing services  certain accounting estimates are utilized 
residential and commercial pest control services are primarily recurring in nature on a monthly or bi monthly basis  while certain types of commercial customers may receive multiple treatments within a given month 
in general  pest control customers sign an initial one year contract  and revenues are recognized at the time services are performed 
for pest control customers  the company offers a discount for those customers who prepay for a full year of services 
the company defers recognition of these advance payments and recognizes the revenue as the services are rendered 
the company classifies the discounts related to the advance payments as a reduction in revenues 
termite baiting revenues are recognized based on the delivery of the individual units of accounting 
at the inception of a new baiting services contract upon quality control review of the installation  the company recognizes revenue for the delivery of the monitoring stations  initial directed liquid termiticide treatment and installation of the monitoring services 
the amount deferred is the fair value of monitoring services to be rendered after the initial service 
the amount deferred for the undelivered monitoring element is then recognized as income on a straight line basis over the remaining contract term  which results in recognition of revenue in a pattern that approximates the timing of performing monitoring visits 
baiting renewal revenue is deferred and recognized over the annual contract period on a straight line basis that approximates the timing of performing the required monitoring visits 
traditional termite treatments are recognized as revenue at the time services are performed 
traditional termite contract renewals are recognized as revenues at the renewal date in order to match the revenue with the approximate timing of the corresponding service provided 
interest income on installment receivables is accrued monthly based on actual loan balances and stated interest rates 
franchise fees are treated as unearned revenue in the statement of financial position for the duration of the initial contract period 
royalties from orkin franchises are accrued and recognized as revenues as earned on a monthly basis 
gains on sales of pest control customer accounts to franchises are recognized at the time of sale and when collection is reasonably assured 
contingency accruals the company is a party to legal proceedings with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies  the company estimates and accrues for its liability and costs associated with the litigation 
estimates and accruals are determined in consultation with outside counsel 
it is not possible to accurately predict the ultimate result of the litigation 
however  in the opinion of management  the outcome of the litigation will not have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations
