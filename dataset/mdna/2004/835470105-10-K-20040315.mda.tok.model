our business general sonicwall provides security  productivity and mobility solutions for businesses of all sizes 
our access security products are typically deployed at the edges of smaller local area networks 
these networks are often aggregated into broader distributed deployments to support companies which do business in multiple physical locations  interconnect their networks with trading partners  or support a mobile or remote workforce 
our products are sold in over countries worldwide 
we generate revenues from the following sources the sale of products  inclusive of the sonicwall platform  the license of software applications that provide additional functionality to these products  the sale of ancillary services delivered through our products  and support and maintenance agreements for our products and software 
we currently outsource our manufacturing to one contract manufacturer  flash electronics  under an agreement that may be cancelled upon days prior notice by either party 
outsourcing our manufacturing enables us to reduce fixed overhead and personnel costs and to provide flexibility in meeting market demand 
we design and develop all the key components of our products  including printed circuit boards and software 
in addition  we determine the components that are incorporated in our products and select the appropriate suppliers of these components 
product testing and burn in are performed by our contract manufacturer using tests that we specify 
we generally sell our products through distributors and value added resellers  who in turn sell our products to end user customers 
some of our resellers are carriers or service providers who provide solutions to the end user customers as managed services 
with current suggested retail prices ranging from to  we seek to provide our channel and customers with differentiated solutions which bring innovative levels of ease of use  reliability and value to a broad business audience 
to support this commitment  we dedicate significant resources to developing new products and marketing our products to our channels and end user customers 
key success factors of our business we believe that there are several key success factors of our business  and that we create value in our business by focusing on execution in these areas 
channel we bring our products to market through distributors and resellers  who we believe provide a valuable service in assisting end users in the design  implementation and service of our security  productivity and mobility applications 
we support our distribution and channel partners with sales  marketing and technical support to help them create and fulfill demand for our offerings 
with this business model we reduce the potential for conflict with our channel by strongly favoring fulfillment through distributors and resellers 
we are also focused on helping our channel partners succeed with our products by concentrating on cost efficiencies in the distribution channel  comprehensive reseller training and certification  and support for our channel s sales activities 
product and service platform our products serve as a platform for revenue generation for both us and our channel 
each appliance sale can result in additional revenue through the simultaneous or subsequent sale of add on software licenses  such as our global management system  or through the sale of additional value added services  such as our content filtering or anti virus services 
we plan to introduce more service options for our platforms  which will allow us to generate additional revenues from both our installed base of platforms as well as from those services coupled to incremental product sales 
distributed architecture our security solutions are based on a distributed architecture which allows our offerings to be deployed and managed at the most efficient location in the network 
specifically  we can provide protection at the gateway and or at the client level  we can provide enforced protection at the client level  and we can monitor report on network activity with our back end capabilities 
thus  we are providing our customers and their service providers with mechanisms to enforce the networking and security policies they have defined for their business 
we also use the flexibility of this architecture to allow us to enable new functionality in already deployed platforms through the provisioning of an electronic key  which may be distributed through the internet 
this ability provides benefits to both us and our end users  since there is no need to modify  physically adjust  or replace devices which might create a significant burden on the company  channel partner or end user in cases where there are a large number of products installed or where the platforms are distributed over a broad area 
end user acceptance the company s platforms and services began offering integrated security appliances in  and since that time has shipped over  revenue units 
we are typically among the top suppliers of such products as measured in units by infonetics research 
our experience in serving a broad market and installed base provides us with opportunities to become leaders in the areas of ease of use and reduced total cost of ownership 
additionally  our demonstrated end user acceptance provides our current and prospective channel partners with an increased level of comfort when deciding to offer our products to their customers 
integrated design our platforms utilize a highly integrated design in order to improve ease of use  lower acquisition and operational costs for our customers  and enhance performance 
each of our products ships with multiple ethernet network connections 
various models also integrate wireless access points  v 
analog modems  and isdn terminal adapters to support different connection alternatives 
every appliance also ships with pre loaded firmware to provide for rapid out of the box set up and easy installation 
each of these task can be managed through a simple web browser session 
in keeping with our philosophy of integrated design  every product can also support additional functionality beyond basic firewall and virtual private networking 
content filtering  anti virus enforcement  and other capabilities are also supported within our appliance 
our opportunities  challenges and risks international growth currently of our revenues are derived from sales in the domestic market 
we believe that our percentage of sales from international territories does not represent the same degree of penetration of those markets as we have achieved domestically 
we believe that a significant opportunity exists to grow our revenues by increasing the international penetration rate to match the current domestic penetration rate 
if we fail to achieve our goal of greater international sales  we may be at a disadvantage to competitors who are able to amortize their product investments over a larger available market 
license and services revenues we believe that the software and services component of our revenue has several characteristics which are positive for our business as a whole the license and services revenues are associated with a higher gross margin than our product revenues  the services component of the revenues is recognized ratably over the services period  and thus provide in aggregate a more predictable revenue stream than product revenues which are generally recognized at the time of the sale  and to the extent that we are able to achieve good renewal rates  we have the opportunity to lower our selling and marketing expenses attributable to that segment 
if we are successful in selling licenses and services to both our installed base and in conjunction with our new product sales  we will be able to leverage incremental revenue out of each product transaction 
however  should we not achieve reasonable rates of selling associated services to our installed base or as part of new product sales  or witness lower service renewal rates  we risk having our revenues concentrated in more unpredictable and lower gross margin product and license sales 
macro economic factors affecting it spending we believe that our products and services are subject to the macro economic drivers that affect much of the information technology it market 
growing it budgets and an increase of funding for projects to provide security  mobility and productivity could drive product upgrade cycles and or create demand for new applications of our products 
contractions in it spending can affect our revenues by causing projects incorporating our products and services to be delayed and or canceled 
vertical markets we have achieved significant sales in certain vertical markets  including the education  retail and healthcare industries 
we believe that we can increase our sales in these markets through dedicated marketing and sales efforts focused to the unique requirements of these vertical markets 
to the extent that we are able to do so  we expect to see revenue growth and increased sales and marketing efficiency 
should our efforts in these areas fall short of our goals  because of unsuitability of our products  increased competition  or for other reasons  we would expect to see a poor return on our marketing and sales investments in these areas 
critical accounting policies and critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate significant estimates used in preparing our financial statements  including those related to sales returns and allowances  bad debt allowances  provisions for excess and obsolete inventory  warranty reserves  restructuring reserves  intangible assets  and deferred income taxes 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
the following critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments  assumptions  and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we derive our revenue from primarily four sources product revenue  which is comprised of hardware based appliances  licensing revenue from software  subscription revenues for products such as content filtering and anti virus protection  and service revenues such as extended warranty and service contracts  training  consulting and engineering services 
as described below  significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period 
we may experience material differences in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if our management makes different judgments or utilizes different estimates 
we recognize product and service revenues in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by sab no 
a  sab no 
b and sab we apply the provisions of statement of position  software revenue recognition sop no 
 as amended by statement of position sop no 
 modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions  to all transactions involving the sale of software products and hardware transactions where the software is not incidental 
for hardware transactions where software is incidental  we do not apply separate accounting guidance to the hardware and software elements 
we apply the provisions of emerging issues task force eitf  applicability of aicpa statement of position  software revenue recognition  to non software deliverables in an arrangement containing more than incidental software  to determine whether the provisions of sop applies to transactions involving the sale of products that include a software component 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  title and risk of loss has been transferred to the customer  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
while our sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions  there are agreements that contain non standard terms and conditions 
in these cases  interpretation of non standard provisions is required to determine the appropriate accounting for the transaction 
delivery to domestic channel partners and international channel partners is generally deemed to occur when we deliver to the product to a common carrier 
however  certain distributor agreements provide for rights of return for stock rotation 
these stock rotation rights are generally limited to of the distributor s prior quarter purchases or other measurable restrictions  and we estimate reserves for these return rights as discussed below 
our second largest distributor  ingram micro  has an unlimited stock rotation right  and therefore we do not deem delivery to have occurred for any sales to ingram micro until they sell the product to their customer  at which time their right of return expires 
in january  we amended our agreement with one of our largest distributors  tech data  and under the amended agreement tech data has the same unlimited stock rotation rights as ingram micro 
these return rights do not apply to any purchases made by tech data prior to january  prior to this amendment  tech data s stock rotation rights were limited to of their prior quarter purchases 
as a result of this amendment  for sales occurring after january   we do not deem delivery to occur for any sales to tech data until they sell the product to their customers  at which time their right of return expires 
we consider either a binding purchase order or signed license agreement as evidence of an arrangement 
sales through our distributors and oem partners are evidenced by a master agreement governing the relationship together with binding purchase orders on a transaction by transaction basis 
at the time of the transaction  we assess whether the fee associated with the transaction is fixed or determinable and whether or not collection is reasonably assured 
we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based upon the terms of the binding purchase order  including the payment terms associated with the transaction 
if a significant portion of a fee is due after our normal payment terms  which are generally to days from invoice date  we account for the fee as not being fixed or determinable 
in these cases  we recognize revenue as the fees become due 
we assess collectability based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
we do not request collateral from our customers 
if we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured  we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
for arrangements with multiple obligations for example  an appliance bundled with a year of free maintenance or content filtering  we allocate revenue to each component of the arrangement based on the objective evidence of fair value of the undelivered elements  which is generally the average selling price of each element when sold separately 
this means that we defer revenue from the arrangement equal to the fair value of the undelivered elements and recognize such amounts as revenue when the elements are delivered 
our arrangements do not generally include acceptance clauses 
however  if an arrangement includes an acceptance provision  acceptance occurs upon the earlier of receipt of a written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period 
we recognize revenue for subscriptions and services such as content filtering and anti virus protection  extended warranty and service contracts  ratably over the contract term 
our training  consulting and engineering services are generally billed and recognized as revenue as these services are performed 
sales returns and other allowances  allowance for doubtful accounts and warranty reserve 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
specifically  we must make estimates of potential future product returns related to current period product revenue 
we analyze historical returns  current economic trends  and changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products when evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns and other allowances 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the sales returns and other allowances in any accounting period 
we may experience material differences in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if management makes different judgments or utilizes different estimates 
the amount of revenues reserved for returns and other allowances amounted to approximately million and million as of december  and  respectively 
in addition  we must make estimates based upon a combination of factors to ensure that our accounts receivable balances are not overstated due to uncollectibility 
we specifically analyze accounts receivable and historical bad debts  the length of time receivables are past due  macroeconomic conditions  deterioration in customer s operating results or financial position  customer concentrations  and customer credit worthiness  when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
our accounts receivable balance was million  net of allowance for doubtful accounts of  as of december  and million  net of allowance for doubtful accounts of million as of december  appliance products are generally covered by a warranty for a one to two year period 
we accrue a warranty reserve for estimated costs to provide warranty services  including the cost of technical support  product repairs  and product replacement for units that cannot be repaired 
our estimate of costs to fulfill our warranty obligations is based on historical experience and expectation of future conditions 
to the extent we experience increased warranty claim activity or increased costs associated with servicing those claims  our warranty accrual will increase  resulting in decreased gross profit 
our warranty accrual amounted to approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
valuation of inventory 
we continually assess the valuation of our inventory and periodically write down the value for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
such estimates are difficult to make under current volatile economic conditions 
reviews for excess inventory are done on a quarterly basis and required reserve levels are calculated with reference to our projected ultimate usage of that inventory 
in order to determine the ultimate usage  we take into account forecasted demand  rapid technological changes  product life cycles  projected obsolescence and our current inventory levels 
the excess balance determined by this analysis becomes the basis for our excess inventory charge 
if actual demand is lower than our forecasted demand  and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly  we could be required to record additional inventory write downs  which would have a negative effect on our gross margin and earnings 
our inventory balance was million  net of allowance for excess and obsolete reserves of million  at december  and million  net of allowance for excess and obsolete reserves of million  at december  this decrease inventory related primarily to improved inventory management and the scrapping of inventory for products that reached end of product life cycle 
accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
as of june  we have a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets because the determination was made that it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax asset may not be realized in the foreseeable future due to historical operating losses 
the net operating losses and research and development tax carryovers that make the vast majority of the deferred tax asset will expire at various dates through the year going forward  we will assess the continued need for the valuation allowance 
after we have demonstrated profitability for a period of time and begin utilizing a significant portion of the deferred tax assets  we may reverse the valuation allowance  likely resulting in a significant benefit to the statement of operations in some future period 
at this time  we cannot reasonably estimate when this reversal might occur  if at all 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill 
in  statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  became effective 
sfas no 
requires  among other things  the discontinuance of goodwill amortization 
in addition  the standard includes provisions upon adoption for the reclassification of certain existing recognized intangibles as goodwill  reassessment of the useful lives of existing recognized intangibles  reclassification of certain intangibles out of previously reported goodwill and the testing for impairment of existing goodwill and other intangibles 
as of january   we have adopted sfas and have ceased to amortize goodwill 
in lieu of amortization  the company is required to perform an impairment review of its goodwill balance on at least an annual basis  upon the initial adoption of sfas no 
and on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the company s reporting units below their carrying value 
this impairment review involves a two step process as follows step a comparison of the fair value of our reporting units to the carrying value  including goodwill of each of those units 
for each reporting unit where the carrying value  including goodwill  exceeds the unit s fair value  we will move to step if a unit s fair value exceeds the carrying value  no further work is performed and no impairment charge is necessary 
step an allocation of the fair value of the reporting unit to its identifiable tangible and non goodwill intangible assets and liabilities 
this will derive an implied fair value for the reporting unit s goodwill 
we will then compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill is greater than the implied fair value of its goodwill  an impairment loss must be recognized for the excess 
we currently operate in one reportable segment  which is also the only reporting unit for purposes of sfas no 
since we currently only have one reporting unit  all of the goodwill has been assigned to the enterprise as a whole 
the estimation of fair value requires that we make judgments concerning future cash flows and appropriate discount rates 
we completed our annual review during the fourth quarter of based on impairment tests performed using independent third party valuations  there was no impairment of our goodwill in fiscal upon our annual review  the implied fair value exceeded the carrying value of our goodwill 
based on similar impairment tests performed in  the carrying value of our goodwill exceeded the implied fair value 
as a result  we have recorded non cash goodwill impairment charges totaling million as of december  any further impairment charges recorded in the future could have a material adverse impact on our financial conditions and results of operations 
significant transactions acquisitions on november   we acquired phobos corporation phobos for million in a transaction accounted for as a purchase 
phobos designed  developed and sold scaleable ssl solutions for internet service providers  application service providers  e commerce companies and web hosting and enterprise network operations centers 
under the terms of the merger  shares of our common stock were exchanged for each share of outstanding phobos common stock on november   the closing date of the merger 
in connection with the merger  we issued  shares of our common stock and options and warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock 
the total purchase price was based upon the average fair value of our common stock for five trading days surrounding the date on which the acquisition was announced 
in addition  we paid million in cash to the shareholders of phobos based upon their pro rata ownership percentage in phobos 
the merger agreement also provided for up to an additional million in cash to be payable upon achievement of certain quarterly revenue targets during  of which million was earned and recorded as additional goodwill 
payments in the amount of million and million were made in and  respectively 
during the quarter ended june   we received  shares of our common stock from phobos in connection with the settlement and termination of the escrow fund  which resulted in a reduction of goodwill of approximately million 
on march   we acquired ignyte technology  inc ignyte in a transaction accounted for as a purchase 
ignyte provided in depth consulting  design and support for enterprise networking customers  as well as management of their internet security needs 
as of the acquisition date we recorded the fair value of ignyte s assets and liabilities 
the total purchase price of million was based upon the average fair value of our common stock for five trading days surrounding the date on which the acquisition was announced 
the purchase price consisted of  in cash consideration   in closing costs and  shares issued for common stock and options of ignyte valued at approximately million 
on october   we acquired substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of redcreek communications  inc redcreek in a transaction accounted for as a purchase 
redcreek developed and sold standards based internet security products for corporate data communications networks that enable the secure transmission of data between offices over the internet 
the total purchase price was million including  in closing costs 
at the closing of the acquisition  we paid million in cash  assumed certain current accounts payable and other liabilities of redcreek  and forgave repayment of bridge loan amounts payable by redcreek to us that were used by redcreek to fund its operating expense from the date the purchase agreement was signed until the closing of the acquisition 
we also assumed redcreek s stock option plan and  options valued at approximately million issued thereunder 
in the event redcreek products achieve certain quarterly sales targets during to  we are obligated to pay additional purchase consideration of up to million in cash  which payments would be recorded  if and when payable  as adjustments to goodwill 
as of december   no additional payments have been earned 
during the course of  we completed several minor transactions for the acquisition of certain technologies and personnel for an aggregate purchase consideration of  shares of common stock valued at approximately million and approximately million in cash consideration 
during the quarter ended december   we issued  in cash and  shares of our common stock related to one of our acquisitions in restructuring charges during and  we implemented two restructuring plans one initiated in the second quarter of and the second initiated in the second quarter of in january  we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred and states that an entity s commitment to an exit plan  by itself  does not create a present obligation that meets the definition of a liability 
accordingly  for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  we will record restructuring charges as the provisions of sfas are met 
restructuring plan during the second quarter of  we approved and initiated a restructuring plan designed to reduce its cost structure and integrate certain company functions 
accordingly  the company recognized a restructuring charge of approximately million during the restructuring charge consisted of  for workforce reduction costs across all geographic regions and functions  million for excess facilities consolidation costs related to lease commitments for space no longer needed to support ongoing operations  and million for abandonment of certain fixed assets consisting primarily of leasehold improvements  computer equipment and related software  and furniture and fixtures 
during  we recorded additional restructuring charges related to the restructuring plan totaling  consisting of  related to properties vacated in connection with facilities consolidation  offset by  reversal for severance accrual for an employee who has remained with the company 
the additional facilities charges resulted from revisions to the company s estimates of future sublease income due to further deterioration of real estate market conditions 
the estimated facility costs were based on the company s contractual obligations  net of estimated sublease income  based on current comparable rates for leases in their respective markets 
should facilities operating lease rental rates continue to decrease in these markets or should it take longer than expected to find a suitable tenant to sublease these facilities  the actual loss could exceed this estimate by approximately  future cash outlays are anticipated through december  unless the company negotiates to exit the leases at an earlier date

accordingly  the company recognized a restructuring charge related to the plan of approximately  during the second quarter of the restructuring charge consisted of  for workforce reduction costs across all geographic regions and functions   for excess facilities consolidation costs related to lease commitments for space no longer needed to support ongoing operations  and  for abandonment of certain fixed assets consisting primarily of computer equipment and related software 
during the six months ended december   the company recorded additional restructuring charges related to the restructuring plan totaling  consisting of  for workforce reduction costs and  related to properties vacated in connection with facilities consolidation 
the additional facilities charges resulted from revisions of our estimates of future sublease income due to further deterioration of real estate market conditions 
the restructuring plan resulted in the vacating of four facilities 
the estimated facility costs were based on the company s discounted contractual obligations  net of assumed sublease income  based on current discounted comparable rates for leases in their respective markets 
should facilities operating lease rental rates decrease in these markets or should it take longer than expected to find a suitable tenant to sublease these facilities  the actual loss could exceed this estimate by approximately  future cash outlays are anticipated through december  unless the company negotiates to exit the leases at an earlier date 
the restructuring plan will result in the elimination of approximately positions worldwide  of which were eliminated as of december  the overall result of the reduction in workforce will be less than the total positions eliminated as the company realigns its workforce requirements

the decrease in the soho product line relates to increased price pressures in the small business space of our market 
the decrease in the ssl product line relates to lower than anticipated demand combined with lower than expected orders from our oem customers 
during the second quarter of  we introduced the soho tzw  which was designed to more effectively compete with other vendors products and is industry s first firewall appliance that integrates secure wireless and vpn technology 
in addition  during the third quarter of  we introduced two new pro series appliances that are powered by our new sonicos operating system that is part of a complete  integrated security and productivity solution 
the addition of the pro products contributed to the stabilization of revenues from the pro product line as compared to due to an increase in the number of units shipped 
in addition our average selling price increased for the pro product line after the introduction of the new products 
our access security products  including our tele  soho  and pro product lines  represented approximately of product revenues in compared to of product revenues in our transaction security and large network access security products  including our ssl and gx product lines and vpn products acquired from redcreek  represented approximately of product revenues in compared to approximately in during  legacy products of acquired entities that have generally been brought to end of life within the first year of combined operations represented approximately of product revenues 
during  we had insignificant product revenues from legacy products 
these revenues have been generated from network infrastructure products that are not part of our long term product strategy 
in addition  our oem product revenues decreased to million in from million in  which primarily related to lower sales of our appliances to our oem partners 
we do not expect oem product revenues to be a significant part of our product revenues in the future 
we anticipate going forward that a majority of our product revenues will continue to be generated from the access security market 
we expect to reach this market primarily through our distribution channels 
in addition  we will also address the needs of large enterprises mainly through our distribution channels 
license and service revenue license and service revenue is comprised primarily of licenses and services such as node upgrades  anti virus protection  and content filtering services that are sold into the installed base of access security appliances 
in addition  we generate license and service revenues from extended service contracts  licensing of our global management software  licensing of our firewall software  and professional services related to training  consulting and engineering services 
the increase in license and service revenue was related to subscription services and service contracts which were primarily due to the increase in our installed base combined with increased marketing efforts geared toward generating renewal contracts 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in licensing our software and asic technology 
we expect the market opportunity for our subscription products in particular our anti virus and content filtering services sold to our installed base to increase as our installed base grows 
we are dedicating increased sales and marketing resources to sell into our installed base  and we are also focusing resources on marketing renewals for existing subscriptions 
in addition during we introduced a new generation of subscription services and software  including our content filtering subscription services  and global management productivity reporting software 
during  revenues from our two primary subscription products  content filtering and anti virus  increased to approximately million from million in in  revenue from service contracts increased to approximately million from million in professional services and training revenue represents approximately and of service revenue during and  respectively 
historically  a significant component of our license and services revenues have been vpn upgrades  which have been offered to our customers as separately licensed products after their initial purchase of an appliance 
we continue to offer vpn upgrades to our customers that purchase products without bundled vpn functionality 
however  there has been a trend in our market to offer vpn functionality as a bundled feature in a firewall product  and in response to this trend we have offered our customers the opportunity to purchase our products with bundled vpn functionality 
the result of this trend has been a decline in our vpn upgrade license revenues 
vpn upgrades represented approximately and of license and service revenues during and  respectively 
we expect this trend to continue as more of our customers choose to purchase vpn functionality through our bundled offerings 
revenues from the licensing of our software and asic technology arise out of unique transactional requirements and are therefore more difficult to predict 
unlike our upgrade and subscription products marketed to our installed base  we do not have dedicated sales and marketing resources to pursue licensing transactions for our technology  but rather we pursue these opportunities as they arise 
we generated approximately million of revenues from the licensing of our software and asic technology during and generated insignificant revenues from the licensing of these products during this decrease is related to the fact that we have not entered into any new license agreements for our asic technology 
we do not believe that we will generate additional license revenues from our asic technology in the future due to the maturity of the underlying technology and competitive technologies available on the market 
channel data our sonicwall products are sold primarily through distributors who then resell our products to resellers and selected retail outlets 
these resellers and retail outlets then sell our products to end users 
two of our distributors  ingram micro and tech data  both of which are global computer equipment and accessory distributors  combined account for approximately and of our revenue in and  respectively 
in  sales through ingram micro and tech data accounted for and of our revenue  respectively 
in  sales to ingram micro and tech data accounted for and of our revenue  respectively 
distribution channels accounted for approximately and of total revenues in and  respectively 
in addition to our distribution channels  we also sell our products to oems who sell our technologies under their brand name

geographic revenue data year ended december in thousands  except percentage data change to americas percentage of total revenues emea percentage of total revenues apac percentage of total revenues total revenues we believe the decrease in international revenues was in part related to macroeconomic conditions in both emea and apac 
for example  in emea the rate of growth of various economies where we do business has been slow 
in addition  the lagging recovery of the japanese economy had a significant impact on our revenues from the apac region 
another contributing factor to the decline in revenues was the decrease in shipments to our international market during the first half of in anticipation of introduction of our new generation of products during the fourth quarter of cost of revenue year ended december in thousands  except percentage data change to product gross margin license and service gross margin amortization of purchased technology total cost of revenue note effect of amortization of purchased technology has been excluded from product and license and service gross margin discussions below

additionally  warranty costs and inventory provisions or write downs are included in cost of product revenue 
cost of product revenue increased primarily as a result of increased overall shipments 
we shipped approximately  total units in compared to  units in  which resulted in an overall average selling price per unit of approximately in compared to approximately in in addition we wrote down and scrapped million of inventory related primarily to our gs  ssl  and generation products 
gross margin from product sales decreased to million  or of product revenue  in the year ended december  from million  or of product revenue  in the year ended december  the decrease in product gross margin is primarily attributable to lower average selling prices 
our average selling prices decreased due to competitive pricing pressure on our pro products 
we expect gross margins to remain under pressure due primarily to continued price competition 
however  we expect these effects to be moderated by continued operational efficiencies  management of our cost structure and an improving macroeconomic outlook 
license and service  gross margin cost of license and service revenue includes all costs associated with the production and delivery of our license and service products  including cost of packaging materials and related costs paid to contract manufacturers  technical support costs related to our service contracts  royalty costs related to certain subscription products  and personnel costs related to the delivery of training  consulting  and professional services 
cost of license and service revenue increased in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  this increase related primarily to technical support costs to support our increased service contract offerings combined with the increased installed base 
to deliver services under these contracts  we outsourced a significant portion of our technical support function to a third party service provider 
finally  we opened an additional support center during gross margin from license and service sales increased to million  or of license and service revenues  in from million  or of license and service revenues  in the decrease in the gross margin percentage related primarily to increased technical support costs associated with the opening of a new support center 
the increase in gross margin in absolute dollars related to increased sales of our subscription services due to increased installed base and increased marketing efforts 
amortization of purchased technology 
year ended december in thousands  except percentage data change to expenses percentage of total revenue amortization of purchased technology represents the amortization of existing technology acquired in our business combinations accounted for using the purchase method 
purchased technology is being amortized over the estimated useful lives of four to six years 
amortization for both years ended december  and december  primarily consisted of million and  relating to the amortization of purchased intangibles associated with the acquisitions of phobos and redcreek  respectively 
future amortization to be included in cost of revenue based on current balance of purchased technology absent any additional investment is as follows in thousands fiscal year total our gross margin has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors  including competition  the mix and average selling prices of products  new product introductions and enhancements  fluctuations in manufacturing volumes and the cost of components and manufacturing labor 
we must manage each of these factors effectively for our gross margins to remain at current levels 
operating expenses research and development year ended december in thousands  except percentage data change to expenses percentage of total revenue research and development expenses primarily consist of personnel costs  contract consultants  outside testing services and equipment and supplies associated with enhancing existing products and developing new products  and related facilities costs 
the increase in absolute dollars was primarily as a result of increased personnel costs whereby salaries and related benefits increased by approximately  in addition our prototype related expenses increased by approximately  in particular these increases were related to the development of the new pro products  new subscription services and a new generation of our firmware 
we believe that our future performance will depend in large part on our ability to maintain and enhance our current product line  develop new products that achieve market acceptance  maintain technological competitiveness  and meet an expanding range of customer requirements 
we plan to continuously invest in current and future product development and enhancement efforts  and incur expense associated with these initiatives  such as prototyping expense and non recurring engineering charges associated with the development of new products and technologies 
we intend to continuously broaden our existing product offerings and introduce new products 
sales and marketing year ended december in thousands  except percentage data change to expenses percentage of total revenue sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of personnel costs  including commissions  costs associated with the development of our business and corporate identification  costs related to customer support  travel  tradeshows  promotional and advertising costs  and related facilities costs 
the net decrease in absolute dollars was primarily related to our restructuring plan  which was implemented in the second quarter of and whereby salaries and related benefits decreased by approximately million as a result of termination of certain sales and marketing personnel 
this reduction in cost was partially offset by an increase in personnel costs that are geared towards the expansion of international markets 
in addition our co op advertising costs decreased by million as a result of decrease in the level of marketing development fund mdf earned and a decrease in revenues 
these decreases were offset by increases of approximately million and  in our customer service costs related to a larger installed base and marketing related activities  respectively 
we expect to direct our sales and marketing expenses in an effort to expand domestic and international markets in order to increase the sale of our products 
in addition  we believe part of our success will depend upon the establishment and expansion of our distribution channels 
we expect that sales and marketing expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we make strategic investments to support our sales efforts in domestic and international locations  hire additional sales personnel  open new international sales offices  and initiate additional marketing programs 
general and administrative year ended december in thousands  except percentage data change to expenses percentage of total revenue general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs  directors and officers insurance  travel expense  and related facilities costs 
the increase in absolute dollars was primarily a result of increased expenses related to corporate governance  insurance costs  and investor relations costs in the amount of  in addition we incurred costs for consultants to assist us in the strategy and execution of our restructuring plan in the amount of  these increases were offset in part by our restructuring plan  which was implemented in the second quarter of whereby the total salaries and related benefits decreased by approximately  in addition we had a reduction in our bad debt expense of approximately  related to the improvement in collecting our accounts receivable combined with lower sales volume during we believe that general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars and remain relatively stable as a percentage of total revenue primarily to support regulatory and corporate governance matters 
amortization of purchased intangible assets 
year ended december in thousands  except percentage data change to expenses percentage of total revenue amortization of purchased intangibles represents the amortization of assets arising from contractual or other legal rights acquired in business combinations accounted for as a purchase and also represents amortization of intangibles assets acquired in a purchased business combination that are separable from the acquired entity  with exception of amortization of existing technology which is included in cost of revenue 
purchased intangible assets are being amortized over their estimated useful lives of three to six years 
the primary reason for the reduction in amortization expense in compared to was that certain intangibles from the phobos acquisition reached the end of their useful life 
amortization for the year ended december  primarily consisted of million   and  relating to the amortization of purchased intangibles associated with the acquisitions of phobos  redcreek  and ignyte  respectively 
amortization for the year ended december  primarily consisted of million   and  associated with the acquisitions of phobos  redcreek  and ignyte  respectively 
future amortization to be included in operating expense based on current balance of purchased intangibles absent any additional investment is as follows in thousands fiscal year total impairment of goodwill 
year ended december in thousands  except percentage data change to expenses percentage of total revenue during the fourth quarter of we performed the annual test for goodwill impairment as required by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
we currently operate in one reportable segment  which is also the only reporting unit for purposes of sfas no 
since we currently only have one reporting unit  all of the goodwill has been assigned to the enterprise as a whole 
we completed our evaluation with the assistance of a third party consultant and concluded that goodwill was not impaired as the fair value of our company exceeded its carrying value  including goodwill 
in performing these analyses  we used the best information available under the circumstances  including reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections of future operating results 
the discount rate used in the analysis was  which was based on historical risk premiums required by investors for companies of our size  industry and capital structure and included risk factors specific to the sectors in which we operate 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded an asset impairment charge totaling million against goodwill and included the charge in operating expenses using the same methodology as discussed above 
any further impairment charges recorded in the future could have a material adverse impact on our financial conditions and results of operations 
restructuring charges 
year ended december in thousands  except percentage data change to expenses percentage of total revenue as previously discussed  we implemented two restructuring plans one initiated in the second quarter of and the second initiated in the second quarter of our restructuring plans are designed to realign and reduce our cost structure and integrate certain company functions 
the execution of the restructuring plan was substantially completed as of the second quarter of we recognized a restructuring charge related to the plan of approximately  during the second quarter of for the remaining of the year ended december   we recorded additional restructuring charges related to the plan of  consisting of  for workforce reductions and  related to properties vacated in connection with facilities consolidation 
the restructuring plan will result in the elimination of approximately positions worldwide  of which were eliminated as of december  the overall result of the reduction in workforce will be less than the total positions eliminated as we realign our workforce requirements 
in addition  the restructuring plan resulted in the vacating of four facilities 
the execution of the restructuring plan was completed as of the second quarter of  however  during we recorded additional restructuring charges totaling  consisting of  related to properties vacated in connection with facilities consolidation  offset by  reversal for severance accrual for an employee who has remained with the us 
the additional facilities charges resulted from revisions of our estimates of future sublease income due to the further deterioration of real estate market conditions 
we may adjust our restructuring related estimates in the future  if necessary 
stock based compensation 
year ended december in thousands  except percentage data change to expenses percentage of total revenue the december  amortization of stock based compensation amount includes   and  relating to deferred stock compensation associated with employee stock options issued in connection with the phobos  ignyte and redcreek acquisitions  respectively 
in addition we recorded  in stock based compensation charge related to acceleration of stock options for two employees 
the december  amortization amount includes   and  relating to deferred stock compensation associated with the employee stock options issued in connection with the phobos  ignyte  and redcreek acquisitions  respectively 
deferred stock compensation related to phobos  ignyte  and redcreek acquisitions has been fully amortized as of december  the decrease in expense from to was primarily caused by a number of the grants becoming fully vested 
interest income and other expense  net 
interest income and other expense  net was million for the year ended december  compared to million in the year ended december   and primarily consists of interest income on our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
the fluctuations in the short term interest rates directly influence the interest income recognized by us 
interest rates for the year ended december  decreased over the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year  resulting in lower interest income 
benefit from provision for income taxes 
year ended december in thousands  except percentage data change to benefit percentage of total revenue in each period  the benefit from income taxes is based on an estimated effective rate for each of the respective calendar years 
in both periods  the provision or benefit for income taxes is based on an estimated effective rate for each of the respective calendar years 
our effective tax rate differs from the statutory federal and state tax rates for the fiscal years ended december  and due primarily to the effect of amortization of stock based compensation  goodwill and intangible assets  which are permanent  non deductible book tax differences and the impact of the change in valuation allowance since as of december  we have a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets because we determined that it is more likely than not that all deferred tax assets may not be realized in the foreseeable future due to historical operating losses 
the net operating loss and research and development tax credit carryovers that make up the vast majority of the deferred tax assets will expire at various dates through the year going forward  we will assess the continued need for the valuation allowance 
after we have demonstrated profitability for a period of time and begin utilizing a significant portion of the deferred tax assets  we may reverse the valuation allowance  likely resulting in a significant benefit to the statement of operations in some future period 
at this time  we cannot reasonably estimate when this reversal might occur  if at all 
compared to revenue year ended december in thousands  except percentage data change to product percentage of total revenue license and service percentage of total revenue total revenue product revenue the decrease in product revenues was across all geographies  and related primarily to a decrease in revenues from our pro product line 
we believe the decrease in pro product line sales in related to increased competition in the mid tier of our market  which resulted in a lower unit market share and a decrease in the average selling price of this product line by in our small to medium enterprise sme products  including our tele  soho and pro product lines  represented approximately of product revenues in compared to of product revenues in our transaction security and large network access security products  including our ssl and gx product lines and vpn products acquired from redcreek  represented approximately of product revenues in compared to approximately in during  we generated approximately  or million  of product revenues from certain legacy products of acquired entities that have generally been brought to end of life within the first year of combined operations 
these revenues have been generated from network infrastructure products that are not part of our long term product strategy 
during  legacy products represented approximately of product revenues 
license and service revenue license and service revenue is comprised primarily of licenses and services such as vpn upgrades  node upgrades  anti virus protection  and content filtering services that are sold into the installed base of access security appliances 
in addition  we generate license and service revenues from extended service contracts  licensing of our global management software  licensing of our vpn asic  licensing of our firewall software  and professional services related to training  consulting and engineering services 
professional services and training revenue represents approximately and of service revenue during and  respectively 
during  revenues from our two primary subscription products  content filtering and anti virus  increased to approximately million from million in  primarily due to increased marketing efforts to our installed base 
in addition  in december  we introduced new subscription service offerings across our product lines to provide our customers maintenance releases of our firmware and technical support 
in  revenue from service contracts increased to approximately million from million in  primarily due to this expanded offering and increased marketing efforts to our installed base 
vpn upgrades represented approximately and of license and service revenues during and  respectively 
this decrease is due to a trend in our market to offer vpn functionality as a bundled feature in a firewall product  and in response to this trend we have offered our customers the opportunity to purchase our products with bundled vpn functionality 
products sold with bundled vpn generate a higher average selling price than the same product without the bundled vpn functionality 
the result of this trend has been a decline in our vpn upgrade license revenues  offset in part by an increase in our product revenues due to higher average selling prices realized from bundled vpn products 
we expect this trend to continue as more of our customers choose to purchase vpn functionality through our bundled offerings 
revenues from the licensing of our software and asic technology result from specific transactional requirements and are more difficult to predict 
unlike our upgrade and subscription products marketed to our installed base  we do not have dedicated sales and marketing resources to pursue licensing transactions for our technology  but rather we pursue these opportunities as they arise 
revenues from the licensing of our software and asic technology decreased to approximately million in from million in this decrease related to a reduction in revenues generated from our oem agreement with netgear  under which they licensed our firewall software for integration into their products 
this decrease also related to the fact that we did not enter into any new license agreements for our asic technology in we do not believe that we will generate additional license revenues from our asic technology in the future due to the maturity of the underlying technology and competitive technologies available on the market 
additionally  we do not believe we will generate further license revenues from netgear during the remaining term of the oem agreement as the amount of revenues generated in the second half of declined to insignificant levels 
channel data our sonicwall products are sold primarily through distributors who then resell our products to resellers and selected retail outlets 
these resellers and retail outlets then sell our products to end users

geographic revenue data year ended december in thousands  except percentage data change to americas percentage of total revenues emea percentage of total revenues apac percentage of total revenues total revenues the decrease in domestic revenue was primarily related to a decrease in product revenue resulting from unfavorable economic conditions and reduced levels of information technology related spending as compared to one year earlier 
our revenues in the emea region increased principally as a result of increasing the capacity of our distribution channels coupled with the corresponding increase in demand for our products as those channels commenced selling our products

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  we classified our short term investments as available for sale 
consequently  investments are recorded on the balance sheet at the fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of tax 
as of december   our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments included money markets securities  corporate bonds  municipal bonds and commercial paper which are subject to no interest rate risk when held to maturity  but may increase or decrease in value if interest rates changes prior to maturity 
as stated in our investment policy  we are averse to principal loss and ensure the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default and market risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in only investment grade instruments 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
due to the short duration of our investment portfolio  we believe an immediate change in interest rates would be immaterial to our financial condition or results of operations 
the following table presents the amounts of our short term investments that are subject to market risk by range of expected maturity and weighted average interest rates as of december  maturing in less than one year more than one year total in thousands  except percentage data short term investments weighted average interest rate foreign currency risk we consider our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal 
we invoice substantially all of our foreign customers from the united states in us dollars and substantially all revenue is collected in us dollars 
for the year ended december   we earned approximately of our revenue from international markets  which in the future may be denominated in various currencies 
because our sales are denominated in us dollars  the weakness of a foreign country s currency against the dollar could increase the price of our products in such country and reduce our product unit sales by making our products more expensive in the local currency 
the weakened dollar could increase the cost of local operating expenses and procurement of raw materials to the extent we must purchase components in foreign currencies 
additionally  we have exposures to emerging market currencies  which can have extreme currency volatility 
as a result  our operating results may become subject to significant fluctuations based upon changes in the exchange rates of some currencies in relation to the us dollar and diverging economic conditions in foreign markets 
although we will continue to monitor our exposure to currency fluctuations  we cannot assure you that exchange rate fluctuations will not affect adversely our financial results in the future 
in addition  we have minimal cash balances denominated in foreign currencies 
we do not enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge exposures denominated in foreign currencies and do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes
