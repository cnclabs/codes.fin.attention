in millions revenues cable networks broadcasting segment operating income loss cable networks broadcasting nm nm media networks vs 
revenues media networks revenues increased  or million  to billion reflecting a increase  or million at the cable networks  and a decrease of  or million  at broadcasting 
increased cable networks revenues were driven by increases of million in revenues from cable and satellite operators and million in advertising revenues 
increased advertising revenue was primarily a result of the increases at espn due to higher advertising rates and at abc family due to higher ratings 
revenues from cable and satellite operators are largely derived from fees charged on a per subscriber basis  and the increases in the current year reflected both contractual rate adjustments and to a lesser extent subscriber growth 
the company s contractual arrangements with cable and satellite operators are renewed or renegotiated from time to time in the ordinary course of business 
a significant number of these arrangements will be up for renewal in the next months 
consolidation in the cable and satellite distribution industry and other factors may adversely affect the company s ability to obtain and maintain contractual terms for the distribution of its various cable and satellite programming services that are as favorable as those currently in place 
if this were to occur  revenues from cable networks could increase at slower rates than in the past or could be stable or decline 
decreased broadcasting revenues were driven primarily by a decrease of million at the abc television production and distribution businesses partially offset by an increase of million at the abc television network 
the decrease in television production and distribution revenues was primarily due to lower syndication revenue and license fees 
the increase at the network was driven by higher advertising revenues reflecting higher rates due to an improved advertising marketplace  partially offset by lower ratings and a decrease due to airing the super bowl in fiscal costs and expenses costs and expenses consist primarily of programming rights amortization  production costs  distribution and selling expenses and labor costs 
costs and expenses decreased  or million  to billion 
the decrease reflected lower costs at broadcasting  partially offset by higher costs at cable 
the decrease at broadcasting was due to lower programming costs partially offset by higher pension and other administrative costs as well as higher moviebeam costs 
higher costs at cable reflected increased programming  pension and administrative costs  partially offset by lower bad debt expense 

table of contents lower programming costs at broadcasting were driven by lower sports programming costs due primarily to the airing of the super bowl in the prior year  lower license fees for primetime series and fewer primetime movies 
additionally  the prior year included higher news production costs due to the coverage of the military conflict in iraq 
higher programming costs at the cable networks were primarily due to higher rights and production costs at espn  partially offset by lower nfl amortization due to commencing the three year option period as described under sports programming costs below 
the decrease in bad debt expense at the cable networks reflected the favorable impact of a bankruptcy settlement with a cable operator in latin america in the second quarter of the current year 
segment operating income segment operating income increased  or million  to billion reflecting increases of million at the cable networks and million at broadcasting 
growth at the cable networks reflected higher affiliate revenues  higher advertising revenue and lower nfl programming costs  partially offset by higher rights and production cost and higher administrative expenses 
increased segment operating income at broadcasting reflected higher advertising revenues at the abc television network and lower programming and production costs  partially offset by higher administrative expenses 
sports programming costs the initial five year period of the company s contract to televise nfl games was non cancelable and ended with the telecast of the pro bowl 
in february  the nfl did not exercise its renegotiation option and as a result  the company s nfl contract was extended for an additional three years ending with the telecast of the pro bowl 
the aggregate fee for the three year period is billion 
espn recognized its portion of the costs of the initial five year term of the contract at levels that increased each year commensurate with expected increases in nfl revenues 
as a result  espn experienced its highest level of nfl programming costs during fiscal the implementation of the contract extension resulted in a million reduction in nfl programming costs at espn in fiscal as compared to fiscal the majority of this decrease was in the first quarter 
these costs will be relatively level over the remaining two years of the contract extension 
cost recognition for nfl programming at the abc television network in fiscal decreased by million as compared to fiscal the decrease at the abc television network is primarily due to the absence of the super bowl  which was aired by the abc television network in fiscal  as well as fewer games in fiscal the absence of the super bowl and the lower number of games at the abc television network also resulted in lower revenue from nfl broadcasts in fiscal due to the payment terms in the nfl contract  cash payments under the contract in fiscal totaled billion as compared to billion in fiscal the company has various contractual commitments for the purchase of television rights for sports and other programming  including the nfl  nba  mlb  nhl and various college football conference and bowl games 
the costs of these contracts have increased significantly in recent years 
we enter into these contractual commitments with the expectation that  over the life of the contracts  revenue from advertising during the programming and affiliate fees will exceed the costs of the programming 
while contract costs may initially exceed incremental revenues and negatively impact operating income  it is our expectation that the combined value to our sports networks from all of these contracts will result in long term benefits 
the actual impact of these contracts on the company s results over the term of the contracts is dependent upon a number of factors  including the strength of advertising markets  effectiveness of marketing efforts and the size of viewer audiences

the discount rate assumption decreased from to reflecting the decline in overall market interest rates and the expected return on plan assets was reduced from to reflecting trends in the overall financial markets

the decrease is due primarily to an increase in the discount rate assumption from to  reflecting increases in prevailing market interest rates 
cash contributions to the plans are expected to decrease in fiscal to approximately million from million in fiscal due to plan asset performance and an increase in the present value of pension obligations  pension obligations exceed plan assets for certain of our pension plans 
in this situation  the 
table of contents accounting rules require that we record an additional minimum pension liability 
the additional minimum pension liability adjustment at september  and is as follows minimum liability at september  decreased liability in pretax aftertax the decrease in the additional minimum pension liability in fiscal was due to the increase in the discount rate from to and improved plan asset performance 
the accounting rules do not require that changes in the additional minimum pension liability adjustment be recorded in current period earnings but rather are to be recorded directly to equity through accumulated other comprehensive income 
expense recognition under the pension accounting rules is based upon long term trends over the expected life of the company s workforce

we believe that the company s financial condition is strong and that its cash balances  other liquid assets  operating cash flows  access to debt and equity capital markets and borrowing capacity  taken together  provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements and future capital expenditures related to the expansion of existing businesses and development of new projects 
however  the company s operating cash flow and access to the capital markets can be impacted by macroeconomic factors outside of its control 
in addition to macroeconomic factors  the company s borrowing costs can be impacted by short and long term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies  which are based  in significant part  on the company s performance as measured by certain credit measures such as interest coverage and leverage ratios 
as of september   moody s investors service s long and short term debt ratings for the company were baal and p  respectively  with stable outlook  and standard poor s long and short term debt ratings for the company were bbb and a  respectively  with stable outlook

table of contents euro disney as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company has signed a memorandum of agreement moa with respect to the financial restructuring of euro disney that remains subject to certain approvals by euro disney s shareholders which the company has agreed to vote in favor of  completion of final documentation  and successful implementation of an equity rights offering by no later than march  if approved  the moa would commit the company to make certain investments in and advances to euro disney

given the current status of the airline industry  we continue to monitor the recoverability of these investments  particularly the delta leases 
delta has disclosed that if it is unsuccessful in reducing its operating expenses and continues to experience significant losses  it will need to seek to restructure its costs under chapter of the us bankruptcy code 
although delta remains current on their lease payments to us  the inability of delta to make their lease payments  or the termination of our lease in a bankruptcy proceeding  could result in a material charge for the write down of our investment and could accelerate certain income tax payments 
legal and tax matters as disclosed in notes and to the consolidated financial statements  the company has exposure for certain legal and tax matters 
accounting policies and estimates we believe that the application of the following accounting policies  which are important to our financial position and results of operations  requires significant judgments and estimates on the part of management 
for a summary of all of our accounting policies  including the accounting policies discussed below  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
film and television revenues and costs we expense the cost of film and television production and participations as well as certain multi year sports rights over the applicable product life cycle based upon the ratio of the current period s gross revenues to the estimated remaining total gross revenues or on a straight line basis  as appropriate 
these estimates are calculated on an individual production basis for film and television and on an individual contract basis for sports rights 
estimates of total gross revenues can change significantly due to a variety of factors  including advertising rates and the level of market acceptance of the production 
for film productions  estimated remaining gross revenue from all sources includes revenue that will be earned within ten years of the date of the initial theatrical release 
for television series  we include revenues that will be earned within years of the delivery of the first episode  or if still in production  five years from the date of delivery of the most recent episode 
for acquired film libraries  remaining revenues include amounts to be earned for up to years from the date of acquisition 
television network and station rights for theatrical movies  series and other programs are charged to expense based on the number of times the program is expected to be shown 
estimates of usage of television network and station programming can change based on competition and audience acceptance 
accordingly  revenue estimates and planned usage are reviewed periodically and are revised if necessary 
a change in revenue projections or planned usage could have an impact on our results of operations 

table of contents costs of film and television productions and programming costs for our television and cable networks are subject to valuation adjustments pursuant to applicable accounting rules 
the net realizable value of the television broadcast program licenses and rights are reviewed using a daypart methodology 
the company s dayparts are early morning  daytime  late night  primetime  news  children and sports includes network and cable 
a daypart is defined as an aggregation of programs broadcast during a particular time of day or programs of a similar type 
the net realizable values of other cable programming are reviewed on an aggregated basis for each cable channel 
estimated values are based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections  film and television programming asset write downs may be required 
revenue recognition the company has revenue recognition policies for its various operating segments  which are appropriate to the circumstances of each business 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of these revenue recognition policies 
we record reductions to revenues for estimated future returns of merchandise  primarily home video  dvd and software products  and for customer programs and sales incentives 
these estimates are based upon historical return experience  current economic trends and projections of customer demand for and acceptance of our products 
if we underestimate the level of returns in a particular period  we may record less revenue in later periods when returns exceed the predicted amount 
conversely  if we overestimate the level of returns for a period  we may have additional revenue in later periods when returns are less than predicted 
pension and postretirement benefit plan actuarial assumptions the company s pension benefit and postretirement medical benefit obligations and related costs are calculated using actuarial concepts  within the framework of statement of financial accounting standards no 
employer s accounting for pensions sfas and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employer s accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions sfas  respectively 
two critical assumptions  the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets  are important elements of expense and or liability measurement 
we evaluate these critical assumptions annually 
other assumptions involve employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns  mortality  turnover and the rate of compensation increase 
the discount rate enables us to state expected future benefit payments as a present value on the measurement date 
the guideline for setting this rate is a high quality long term corporate bond rate 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense 
we increased our discount rate to in from in to reflect market interest rate conditions 
a one percentage point decrease in the assumed discount rate would increase annual expense and the projected benefit obligation by million and million  respectively 
a one percentage point increase in the assumed discount rate would decrease annual expense and projected benefit obligations by million and million  respectively 
to determine the expected long term rate of return on the plan assets  we consider the current and expected asset allocation  as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class 
a lower expected rate of return on pension plan assets will increase pension expense 
our long term expected return on plan assets was in both and  respectively 
a one percentage point change in the long term return on pension plan asset assumption would impact annual pension expense by approximately million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
goodwill  intangible assets  long lived assets and investments effective october   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
goodwill and other intangible assets must be tested 
table of contents for impairment on an annual basis 
we completed our impairment testing as of september  and determined that there were no impairment losses related to goodwill and other intangible assets 
in assessing the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets  market values and projections regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors are used to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or related projections change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
for purposes of performing the impairment test for goodwill as required by sfas we established the following reporting units cable networks  television broadcasting  radio  studio entertainment  consumer products and parks and resorts 
sfas requires the company to compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount on an annual basis to determine if there is potential goodwill impairment 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill within the reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
sfas requires the company to compare the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset to its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of an indefinite lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized 
fair values for goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets are determined based on discounted cash flows  market multiples or appraised values as appropriate 
to determine the fair value of our reporting units  we generally use a present value technique discounted cash flow corroborated by market multiples when available and as appropriate  for all of the reporting units except for the television network which is included in the television broadcasting group 
the television broadcasting reporting unit includes the television network and the owned and operated television stations 
these businesses have been grouped together because their respective cash flows are dependent on one another 
for purposes of our impairment test  we used a revenue multiple to value the television network 
we did not use a present value technique or a market multiple approach to value the television network as a present value technique would not capture the full fair value of the television network and there is little comparable market data available due to the scarcity of television networks 
we applied what we believe to be the most appropriate valuation methodology for each of the reporting units 
if we had established different reporting units or utilized different valuation methodologies  the impairment test results could differ 
long lived assets include certain long term investments 
the fair value of the long term investments is dependent on the performance of the investee companies  as well as volatility inherent in the external markets for these investments 
in assessing potential impairment for these investments  we consider these factors as well as forecasted financial performance of our investees 
if these forecasts are not met  impairment charges may be required 
contingencies and litigation we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and  as required  have accrued estimates of the probable costs for the resolution of these claims 
these estimates have been developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more detailed information on litigation exposure 
income tax audits as a matter of course  the company is regularly audited by federal  state and foreign tax authorities 
from time to time  these audits result in proposed assessments 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company reached a settlement with the internal revenue service regarding all 
table of contents assessments proposed with respect to the company s federal income tax returns for through this settlement resulted in the company releasing million in tax reserves which are no longer required with respect to these matters 
this release of reserves is reflected in the current year income tax provision 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company resolved certain state income tax audit issues and the corresponding release of million of related tax reserves is reflected in the income tax provision 
accounting changes fin r in december  the fasb issued fin r which was generally effective as of march  variable interest entities vies are primarily entities that lack sufficient equity to finance their activities without additional financial support from other parties or whose equity holders lack adequate decision making ability 
all vies with which the company is involved must be evaluated to determine the primary beneficiary of the risks and rewards of the vie

the company has minority equity interests in certain entities  including euro disney sca euro disney and hongkong international theme parks limited hong kong disneyland

the company also has variable interests in certain other vies that will not be consolidated because the company is not the primary beneficiary 
these vies do not involve any material exposure to the company

 accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of fsp in response to a new law regarding prescription drug benefits under medicare as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree healthcare benefit plans 
we expect that the impact of this act will not be material 
eitf the company adopted emerging issues task force eitf no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf  effective october   in the fiscal fourth quarter of eitf addresses revenue recognition for revenues derived from a single contract that contains multiple products or services 
the rule provides additional requirements to determine when such revenues may be recorded separately for accounting purposes 
historically  the company had recognized the nfl broadcast portion of espn s affiliate revenue when the nfl games were aired  as espn s affiliate contracts provided a basis for allocating such revenue between nfl and non nfl programming 
since the cost of the nfl rights had also been recognized as the games were aired  the company recognized both the nfl revenues and nfl costs in the quarters the games were aired 
under eitf s requirements for separating the revenue elements of a single contract  the company no longer allocates espn s affiliate revenue between nfl and non nfl programming for accounting purposes 
as a consequence  the company no longer matches all nfl revenue with nfl costs as espn affiliate revenue including the nfl portion is generally recognized ratably throughout the year  while nfl contract costs continue to be recognized in the quarters the games are aired 
this accounting change impacts only the timing of revenue recognition and has no impact on cash flow 
as a result of this change  the media networks segment reports significantly reduced revenue 
table of contents and profitability in the first fiscal quarter when the majority of the nfl games are aired  with commensurately increased revenues and profits in the second and third fiscal quarters 
the company elected to adopt this new accounting rule using the cumulative effect approach 
in the fiscal fourth quarter of  the company recorded an after tax charge of million for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting as of the beginning of fiscal year this amount represented the revenue recorded for nfl games in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  which would have been recorded ratably over fiscal under the new accounting method

factors that may affect forward looking statements 
for an enterprise as large and complex as the company  a wide range of factors could materially affect future developments and performance 
significant factors affecting specific business operations are identified in connection with the description of these operations and the financial results of these operations elsewhere in this report 
general factors affecting our operations include changes in company wide or business unit strategies  which may result in changes in the types or mix of businesses in which the company is involved or will invest  changes in us  global or regional economic conditions  which may affect attendance and spending at the company s parks and resorts  purchases of company licensed consumer products  the advertising market for broadcast and cable television programming and the performance of the company s theatrical and home entertainment releases  changes in us and global financial and equity markets  including market disruptions and significant interest rate fluctuations  which may impede the company s access to  or increase the cost of  external financing for its operations and investments  changes in cost of providing pension and other postretirement medical benefits  including changes in health care costs  investment returns on plan assets  and discount rates used to calculate pension and related liabilities  increased competitive pressures  both domestically and internationally  which may  among other things  affect the performance of the company s parks and resorts operations  divert consumers from our creative or other products  or to other products or other forms of entertainment  or lead to increased expenses in such areas as television programming acquisition and motion picture production and marketing  legal and regulatory developments that may affect particular business units  such as regulatory actions affecting environmental activities  consumer products  theme park safety  broadcasting or internet activities or the protection of intellectual property  the imposition by foreign countries of trade restrictions or motion picture or television content requirements or quotas  and changes in domestic or international tax laws or currency controls

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes  foreign currency fluctuations and changes in the market values of its investments 
policies and procedures in the normal course of business  we employ established policies and procedures to manage the company s exposure to changes in interest rates  foreign currencies and the fair market value of certain investments in debt and equity securities using a variety of financial instruments 
our objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rate volatility on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  we primarily use interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes related to the company s portfolio of borrowings 
by policy  the company maintains fixed rate debt as a percentage of its net debt between a minimum and maximum percentage 
our objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility in order to allow management to focus on core business issues and challenges 
accordingly  the company enters into various contracts that change in value as foreign exchange rates change to protect the value of its existing foreign currency assets  liabilities  commitments and forecasted foreign currency revenues 
the company utilizes option strategies and forward contracts that provide for the sale of foreign currencies to hedge probable  but not firmly committed  transactions 
the company also uses forward contracts to hedge foreign currency assets and liabilities 
the principal foreign currencies hedged are the euro  british pound  japanese yen and canadian dollar 
cross currency swaps are used to effectively convert foreign currency denominated borrowings to us dollar denominated borrowings 
by policy  the company maintains hedge coverage between minimum and maximum percentages of its forecasted foreign exchange exposures generally for periods not to exceed five years 
the gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the value of the related exposures 

table of contents it is the company s policy to enter into foreign currency and interest rate derivative transactions and other financial instruments only to the extent considered necessary to meet its objectives as stated above 
the company does not enter into these transactions for speculative purposes 
value at risk var the company utilizes a var model to estimate the maximum potential one day loss in the fair value of its interest rate  foreign exchange and market sensitive equity financial instruments 
the var model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a confidence level 
various modeling techniques can be used in a var computation 
the company s computations are based on the interrelationships between movements in various interest rates  currencies and equity prices a variance co variance technique 
these interrelationships were determined by observing interest rate  foreign currency and equity market changes over the preceding quarter for the calculation of var amounts at september  the model includes all of the company s debt as well as all interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts and market sensitive equity investments 
the values of foreign exchange options do not change on a one to one basis with the underlying currencies  as exchange rates vary 
therefore  the hedge coverage assumed to be obtained from each option has been adjusted to reflect its respective sensitivity to changes in currency values 
forecasted transactions  firm commitments and receivables and accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies  which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge  were excluded from the model 
the var model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by the company  nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors 
var on a combined basis decreased from million at september  to million at september  the majority of the decrease is due to increased correlation benefits and lower market value of interest rate sensitive instruments 
the estimated maximum potential one day loss in fair value  calculated using the var model  is as follows unaudited  in millions interest rate currency sensitive sensitive equity sensitive financial financial financial combined in millions instruments instruments instruments portfolio var as of september  average var during the year ended september  highest var during the year ended september  lowest var during the year ended september  var as of september  the var for euro disney and hong kong disneyland is immaterial as of september  in calculating the var it was determined that credit risks are the primary driver for changes in the value of euro disney s debt rather than interest rate risks 
accordingly  we have excluded euro disney s borrowings from the var calculation
