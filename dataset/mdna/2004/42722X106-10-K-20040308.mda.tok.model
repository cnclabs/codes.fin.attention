item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is intended to assist in understanding the financial condition and results of operations of the company 
the information contained in this section should be read with the december  audited consolidated financial statements and notes to those financial statements included in this form k 
statements concerning future performance  developments or events  expectations for growth and market forecasts  and any other guidance on future periods  constitute forward looking statements and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties  which might cause actual results to differ materially from stated expectations 
specific factors include  but are not limited to  the effect of interest rate changes  risks associated with acquisition of other banks and opening new branches  the ability to control costs and expenses  and general economic conditions 
additional information on these and other factors  which could affect our financial results are included in our filings with the securities and exchange commission 
critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
companies may apply certain critical accounting policies requiring management to make subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to estimate the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the company considers its most critical accounting policy to be the allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses charged against earnings 
the balance of the allowance for loan losses is maintained at the amount management believes will be adequate to absorb known and inherent losses in the loan portfolio 
the appropriate balance of allowance for loan losses is determined by applying estimated loss factors to the credit exposure from outstanding loans 
estimated loss factors are based on subjective measurements including management s assessment of the internal risk classifications  changes in the nature of the loan portfolio  industry concentrations and the impact of current local  regional and national economic factors on the quality of the loan portfolio 
changes in these estimates and assumptions are reasonably possible and may have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements  results of operation or liquidity 
for additional information regarding the allowance for loan losses  its relation to the provision for loans losses  risk related to asset quality and lending activity  see part i  item as well as the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation provision for loan losses 
overview heritage financial corporation is a bank holding company  which primarily engages in the business activities of our wholly owned subsidiaries heritage savings bank and central valley bank 
we provide financial services to our local communities with an ongoing strategic focus in expanding our commercial lending relationships  market expansion and a continual focus on asset quality 
during the five year period from thru our total assets have grown million  or  with net loans making up million of this increase 
our emphasis in growing our commercial loan portfolio resulted in an increase in commercial loans of million  or  since in addition  the overall loan increases were enhanced by our emphasis in growing our pierce county market 
deposits have increased million  or  for the period from thru with a change in deposit mix from certificates of deposits to non interest and low interest bearing demand deposits 
these deposit increases are due to our focus on growing our customer base as well as the ongoing market conditions causing investors to invest in deposit accounts instead of the stock market 
as a whole  our customers are investing in 
table of contents short term deposit products 
in turn  equity has declined by million since december  as a result of our stock repurchase programs 
since  we have repurchased  shares totaling million 
during the five year period from thru  our net income has increased by or million 
the result of these five year trends have provided our company with an increase in return on average equity from for the year ended december  to for year ended december  our short term goal is to reach a return on average equity of for the year ended our profitability depends primarily on our net interest income  which is the difference between the income we receive on our loan and investment portfolios  and our cost of funds  which consists of interest paid on deposits and borrowed funds 
like most financial institutions  our interest income and cost of funds are affected significantly by general economic conditions  particularly changes in market interest rates and government policies 
changes in net interest income result from changes in volume  net interest spread  and net interest margin 
volume refers to the average dollar amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
net interest spread refers to the difference between the average yield on interest earning assets and the average cost of interest bearing liabilities 
net interest margin refers to net interest income divided by average interest earning assets and is influenced by the level and relative mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing and non interest bearing liabilities

the pierce county expansion involved the addition of commercial lenders and a newly leased commercial lending office 
net interest income 
net interest income decreased  to million for the year ended december  compared with the previous year of million 
the decline in net interest income resulted primarily from the tightening of the net interest margin in a declining interest rate environment 
net interest income as a percentage of average earning assets net interest margin for the year ended december  decreased to from for the previous year 
our net interest spread for the year ended december  decreased to from for the prior year 
this corresponded with the decrease in the average cost of funds to for the year ended december  from for the same period last year as well as the decrease in the average rate of interest earning assets to for the year ended december  from for the same period last year 
the low rate environment is a result of a continued weak economy and an effort by the federal reserve to stimulate the economy 
overall  our net interest margin is very strong at in comparison to the median for west coast publicly traded thrifts of and west coast publicly traded commercial banks of as reported by da davidson and companies

total noninterest expense decreased  or  for the year ended compared to the period 
the current year noninterest expense reflects the elimination of goodwill  totaling  in prior years  due to the adoption of financial accounting standard fas effective january   which requires that goodwill no longer be amortized  but instead periodically tested for impairment 
merchant visa expenses also increased by  or  which was in line with the increase in merchant visa income 
personnel expenses increased  or 
other expenses decreased  or  due primarily to the costs associated with the vision initiative of  during we incurred vision expenses during  which were primarily consulting fees paid to alex sheshunoff management services  lp liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of funds are deposits  loan repayments  loan sales  interest earned on and proceeds from investment securities  and advances from the fhlb of seattle 
these funds  together with retained earnings  equity and other borrowed funds  are used to make loans  acquire investment securities and other assets  and fund continuing operations 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans are a predictable source of funds  deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by the level of interest rates  economic conditions  and competition 
we must maintain an adequate level of liquidity to ensure the availability of sufficient funds to fund loan originations and deposit withdrawals  satisfy other financial commitments  and fund operations 
we generally maintain sufficient cash and short term investments to meet short term liquidity needs 
at december   cash and cash equivalents totaled million  or of total assets 
at december   our banks maintained a credit facility with the fhlb of seattle for million of which we borrowed million as of december  during total assets grew million with net loans increasing by million over the prior year end and deposits increasing million over the prior year end 
as a result  we borrowed from the fhlb of seattle and had an increase year over year of million 
our strategy has been to acquire core deposits which we define to include all deposits except public funds from our retail accounts  acquire noninterest bearing demand deposits from our commercial customers  and use available credit lines to fund growth in assets 
we anticipate that we will continue to rely on the same sources of funds in the future and use those funds primarily to make loans and purchase investment securities 

table of contents we  and our banks  are subject to various regulatory capital requirements 
as of december   we  and our banks were classified as well capitalized institutions under the criteria established by the federal deposit insurance act 
our initial public offering in january of significantly increased our capital to levels well in excess of regulatory requirements and our internal needs 
in  we determined that buying our own shares with some of our excess capital was the best use of this capital and we began to buy back our company s outstanding shares 
as of december   we have repurchased  shares of our stock representing of the total outstanding as of march  at an average price of reducing our capital levels by million 
our capital levels will also be modestly impacted by our k employee stock ownership plan and trust ksop 
the employee stock ownership plan esop purchased of the common stock issued in the january stock offering and borrowed from the company to fund the purchase of the company s common stock 
the loan to the esop will be repaid principally from the bank s contributions to the esop 
the bank s contributions will be sufficient to service the debt over the year loan term at the interest rate of 
as the debt is repaid  shares are released  and allocated to plan participants based on the proportion of debt service paid during the year 
as shares are released  compensation expense is recorded equal to the then current market price of the shares  our capital is increased  and the shares become outstanding for earnings per share calculations 
for the year ended december   the company has allocated or committed to be released to the esop  earned shares and has  unearned  restricted shares remaining to be released 
the fair value of unearned  restricted shares held by the esop trust was  at december  asset liability management our primary financial objective is to achieve long term profitability while controlling our exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates 
to accomplish this objective  we have formulated an interest rate risk management policy that attempts to manage the mismatch between asset and liability maturities while maintaining an acceptable interest rate sensitivity position 
the principal strategies which we employ to control our interest rate sensitivity are selling most long term  fixed rate  one to four family residential mortgage loan originations  originating commercial loans and residential construction loans at variable interest rates for terms generally one year or less  and offering noninterest bearing demand deposit accounts to businesses and individuals 
the longer term objective is to increase the proportion of noninterest bearing demand deposits  low interest bearing demand deposits  money market accounts  and savings deposits relative to certificates of deposit to reduce our overall cost of funds 
our asset and liability management strategies have resulted in a positive month gap of and a positive month gap of as of december  these gaps measure the difference between the dollar amount of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities that mature or reprice within the designated period three months and months as a percentage of total interest earning assets  based on certain estimates and assumptions as discussed below 
we believe that the implementation of our operating strategies has reduced the potential effects of changes in market interest rates on our results of operations 
the positive gap for the month period indicates that decreases in market interest rates may adversely affect our results over that period 

table of contents the following table provides the estimated maturity or repricing and the resulting interest rate sensitivity gap of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at december  based upon estimates of expected mortgage prepayment rates and deposit run off rates consistent with national trends 
we adjusted mortgage loan maturities for loans held for sale by reflecting these loans in three month category  which is consistent with their sale in the secondary mortgage market 
the amounts in the table are derived from our internal data 
we used certain assumptions in presenting this data so the amounts may not be consistent with other financial information prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the amounts in the tables also could be significantly affected by external factors  such as changes in prepayment assumptions  early withdrawal of deposits  and competition 
estimated maturity or repricing within months months years years more than years total dollars in thousands interest earnings assets loans investment securities fhlb and federal reserve stock fed funds sold interest earning deposits total interest earning assets interest bearing liabilities total interest bearing deposits fhlb advances and other borrowings total interest bearing liabilities rate sensitivity gap cumulative rate sensitivity gap amount as a percentage of total interest earning assets certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing table 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on some types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market interest rates 
additionally  some assets  such as adjustable rate mortgages  have features  which restrict changes in the interest rates of those assets both on a short term basis and over the lives of such assets 
further  if a change in market interest rates occurs  prepayment  and early withdrawal levels could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the tables 
finally  the ability of many borrowers to service their adjustable rate debt may decrease if market interest rates increase substantially 
impact of inflation and changing prices inflation affects our operations by increasing operating costs 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  changes in interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
although interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or the same extent as the prices of goods and services  increases in inflation generally have resulted in increased interest rates
