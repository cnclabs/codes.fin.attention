item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation overview we had a challenging year in the twelve month period ended march  fiscal 
during fiscal  we reported a net loss of million  or per diluted share  on sales of million which compares to net income of million in fiscal or 
per diluted share  on sales of million 
sales decreased primarily from increased competition in the united states and in international markets 
in fiscal  we overestimated the demand for our products and as result had million of excess inventory at year end 
in addition  both our retail customers and our international distributors carried excess singing machine inventory into fiscal  which impacted our ability to sell into the trade and distribution channels 
our gross profit decreased to million or of total revenues in fiscal compared to gross profit of million or of total revenues in fiscal our net loss for fiscal was million  which includes several unusual operating expenses litigation expenses severance expenses  lease termination costs  write off of prepaid royalties tooling impairment charges  write off of capitalized cost of reorganization intangible 
in july  we made a decision to restate our audited financial statements for the fiscal years ended march  and march  because we revised our position on the taxation of the income of international smc  our hong kong subsidiary 
see restatement on pages as a result of this restatement we were named as a defendant in several class action lawsuits and a derivative lawsuit 
the shareholder complains were consolidated into one lawsuit in the united states district court for southern florida 
we entered into a settlement agreement with the class action plaintiffs in april and are waiting for final approval of the settlement on july  see legal proceedings on page we incurred approximately  for the settlement and related expenses  net of reimbursement from our insurance carrier 
in july  we raised million in subordinated debt financing from an investment group comprised of an officer  directors and an associate of one of our directors 
on august   lasalle amended the credit agreement  which extended the loan until march  and waived the condition of default 
on september   we raised million in an offering of convertible subordinated debentures to six accredited investors 
the proceeds of the debenture were used to pay down our accounts payable liabilities  finance operations and pay down a portion of our loan with lasalle 
on december   we again violated the tangible net worth requirement and working capital requirements under our credit agreement with lasalle 
on january   we paid off our loan with lasalle and lasalle released its security interests in our assets 
we entered into a factoring agreement with milberg factors effective as of february  despite the reduction in expenses and the additional capital  we still had minimal liquidity during fiscal as such  we were forced to sell excess inventory at or below cost 
during fiscal  we sold approximately of our inventory at prices at or below cost 
as such  our gross profit decreased to of our net sales 
as of march   we did not have any advances outstanding under our factoring agreement with milberg  however  we were in violation of the covenants relating to working capital and tangible net worth 
because of our limited liquidity  we received a going concern uncertainty paragraph on our audited financial statements for fiscal although our cash on hand as of july  is limited  we believe that we will have sufficient cash from operations to fund our operating requirements for the next three months 
after three months  we expect to begin collecting accounts receivable from the sales of our karaoke products in the second and third quarters 
if there is a need for additional funds  short term loans will be obtained 
see liquidity beginning on page we will continue to sell older inventory models at discounted prices to generate cash as well as continuing to reduce operating expenses

loss income as restated 
restatement of financial statements in june  management revised its position on taxation of its subsidiary s income by the united states and by the hong kong tax authorities 
with regard to taxation in hong kong  our subsidiary had previously applied for a hong kong offshore claim income tax exemption based on the locality of profits of the hong kong subsidiary 
management believed that the exemption would be approved because the source of all profits of the hong kong subsidiary is from exporting to customers outside of hong kong 
accordingly  no provision for income taxes was provided in the consolidated financial statements as of march  and however  full disclosure was previously reflected in the audited financial statements for years ended march  and of the estimated amount that would be due to the hong kong tax authority should the exemption be denied 
management is continuing its exemption application process 
however  due to the extended period of time that the application has been outstanding  as well as management s reassessment of the probability that the application will be approved  management has determined to restate the and consolidated financial statements to provide for such taxes 
the effect of such restatement is to increase income tax expense by  and  in fiscal and  respectively 
however  we can claim united states foreign tax credits in for these hong kong taxes  which is reflected in the final restated amounts 
with regard to united states taxation of foreign income  we had originally taken the position that the foreign income of the hong kong subsidiary qualified for a deferral under the internal revenue code allowing for such income to be indefinitely deferred and not taxed in the united states until such income is repatriated 
full disclosure of the amount and nature of the indefinite deferral for fiscal year was reflected in the income tax footnote of the consolidated financial statements for that year 
the internal revenue code  regulations and case law regarding international income taxation is quite complex and subject to interpretation 
each case is determined based on the individual facts and circumstances 
due to certain inter company loans made in and  the profits previously considered to be indefinitely deferred became partially taxable as deemed dividends under section of the internal revenue code 
although certain arguments against the imposition of a deemed dividend may be asserted  management has determined to restate the fiscal year consolidated financial statements based on its reassessment of its original position 
the effect of such restatement is to increase income tax expense by  in fiscal year  which includes the utilization of the foreign tax credits referred to above 
the net effect of the above two adjustments is to decrease net income by  and  in fiscal and the net effect on net income per share is to decrease net income per share basic and diluted by and  respectively in fiscal and decrease net income per share basic and diluted by and  respectively in fiscal fiscal year ended march  compared with fiscal year ended march  net sales net sales for the fiscal year ended march  decreased to million compared to revenues of million in the fiscal year ended march  the decrease in net sales was due to both decreases in unit volume as well as pricing  due to increases in competition in the united states and international markets 
in fiscal year  of our sales were direct sales  which represent sales made by international smc  and were domestic sales  which represent sales made from our warehouse in the united states 
the sales decreases occurred in all segments of our business 
our total hardware sales decreased to million  in fiscal compared to total hardware sales of million in fiscal the total decrease of hardware sales of million from the previous year sales level is the primary due to the increasing market competition 
also we had to lower our price in order to move the overstocked inventory from fiscal year in addition  there was a significant decrease in our music sales 
music sales decreased to million  or of net sales  in fiscal  compared to million  or of net sales  in fiscal the decrease in music sales is also a result of increased competition in this category  both domestically as well as internationally 
gross profit gross profit for fiscal was  or of total revenues compared to  or of sales for fiscal the decrease in gross margin compared to the prior year is primarily due to the following factors i write down of inventories  ii sales made at lower prices to generate cash from operation  iii increased sales by international smc  the gross profit margin is lower for the sales shipped from hong kong due to the volume discount and reduction of the warehousing and insurance expenses and iv tooling impairment cost of  at the end of fiscal  our inventory levels were much higher than we expected 
we determined that due to liquidation sales  inventory would be sold at a loss  therefore  a decrease in the value of specific inventory items was made 
the total amount of the provision for inventory was million in fiscal compared to a provision of million in fiscal in addition to the write down of inventories  due to competitive price pressure  a significant amount of sales shipped in current year were made at lower margins than in previous years 
in the fourth quarter  we sold million of inventory with a negative margin of  after applying inventory valuation reserves 
our product line did not sell as well as our retailers and mass merchants had expected 
as a result  we agreed to give our customers pricing concessions and allowed them to return inventory to us 
we issued over million in customer credits during the fourth quarter  which reduced our sales and gross profit margins equally 
our gross margins were also negatively affected by the return of million in inventory 
our decrease in our gross margin percentage in fiscal compared to fiscal was also reduced by the mix of our sales 
the percentage of sales made by our hong kong subsidiary increased from of the total sales in fiscal to in fiscal usually  sales made by international smc historically maintain a lower gross profit margin because there are no variable expenses from these sales 
other variable expenses that are normally included with sales are advertising allowances  returns and commissions 
our gross profit may not be comparable to those of other entities  since some entities include the costs of warehousing  inspection  freight charges and other distribution costs in their cost of sales 
we account for the above expenses as operating expenses and classify them under selling  general and administrative expenses operating expenses operating expenses were  or of net sales in fiscal compared to  or of net sales in fiscal the primary factors that contributed to the increase in operating expenses are o increased compensation expenses in the amount of  in fiscal of which approximately  was for severance payments to four former executive officers  o increased selling  general and administrative expenses of  due to o increased legal fees in the amount of  of which approximately  was for the class action settlement  and increased consulting fees in the amount of approximately  which was related to consulting work performed by our lender  o increased rent expenses in the amount of  due to the expansion of the warehouse facility in rancho dominguez in fiscal the increase warehouse space was necessary to stock the unanticipated unsold inventories in fiscal year and expenses of  for early termination of the lease in rancho dominguez  california o a write off of the capitalized cost of reorganization of  o increased accounting expenses in the amount of  which was due to the additional work needed to restate our financial statements for the fiscal years ended march  and and work required on the filing of certain registration statements and o increased bank fees and loan cost in the amount of  which was related to the loan agreement with lasalle bank 
this increase in expenses was offset by decreases in our advertising expenses and our freight and handling charges in the amount of  and  respectively 
advertising expense consists of two components co operative advertising and direct advertising expense 
co operative advertising is paid directly to the customer and the allowances are based on the amount of sales 
the customer provides copies of advertising on which these funds are spent  but has complete discretion as to the use of these funds 
as we believe that there is a separate and identifiable benefit associated with the co operative advertising  such amounts are recorded as a component of operating expenses 
co operative advertising expenses decreased to  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal because our sales decreased 
our royalty expenses were  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal our royalty expenses in fiscal included a write off of  in pre paid royalties under our licensing agreement with mtv 
depreciation and amortization our depreciation and amortization expenses were  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal this increase in depreciation and amortization expenses can be attributed to our investment in tooling and dies for the new models  in addition to the acceleration in the depreciation method used to write off the useful life of the tools and dies 
net other expenses net other expenses were  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal net other expenses increased because our interest expense increased to million in fiscal compared to  in fiscal our interest expense increased because we recorded  for the amortization of the discount and related deferred financing fees on our convertible debentures and approximately  relates to interest expense on the lasalle loan  interest on the convertible debentures  interest on the insiders loan  and interest expense incurred at our hong kong subsidiary 
we expect interest expense to increase further in fiscal  as we will have a full year s worth of amortization of the discount on the convertible debentures and related deferred financing fees 
income before taxes we had a net loss before taxes of  in fiscal compared to net income of  in fiscal income tax expense significant management judgment is required in developing our provision for income taxes  including the determination of foreign tax liabilities  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances that might be required against the deferred tax assets 
management evaluates its ability to realize its deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis and adjusts its valuation allowance when it believes that it is more likely than not that the asset will not be realized 
at december  and march   we concluded that a valuation allowance was needed against all of our deferred tax assets  as it was not more likely than not that the deferred taxes would be realized 
at march  and  we had gross deferred tax assets of million and million  against which we recorded valuation allowances totaling million and  respectively 
for the fiscal year ended march   we recorded a tax provision of  this occurred because the valuation allowance established against our deferred tax assets exceeded the amount of the benefit created from carrying back a portion of the current year s losses 
the carry back of the losses from the current year resulted in an income tax receivable of million  which is included in refundable tax in the accompanying balance sheets 
we have now exhausted our ability to carry back any further losses and therefore will only be able to recognize tax benefits to the extent that we has future taxable income 
our subsidiary has applied for an exemption of income tax in hong kong 
therefore  no taxes have been expensed or provided for at the subsidiary level 
although no decision has been reached by the governing body  the parent company has reached the decision to provide for the possibility that the exemption could be denied and accordingly has recorded a provision for hong kong taxes in fiscal and there was no provision for hong kong income taxes in fiscal due to the subsidiary s net operating loss for the year 
hong kong income taxes payable totaled million at march  and and is included in the accompanying balance sheets as income taxes payable 
we effectively repatriated approximately million  million and million from our foreign operations in  and  respectively 
accordingly  these earnings were taxed as a deemed dividend based on us statutory rates 
we have no remaining undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiary 
we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in those jurisdictions 
because of the complex issues involved  any claims can require an extended period to resolve 
in management s opinion  adequate provisions for income taxes have been made 
net loss net income as a result of the foregoing  we had a net loss of million in compared to net income of million in fiscal fiscal year ended march  compared with fiscal year ended march  net sales net sales for the fiscal year ended march  increased to  compared to  for the fiscal year ended march  our growth was driven in large part by the addition of international sales in europe  asia  and australia 
we also generated  million or of our net sales from products sold under the mtv license in fiscal strong sales of our music titles were also driving forces in our revenue growth for fiscal in fiscal  our sales of music increased to  or of sales as compared to  or of net sales in fiscal in fiscal  of our sales were direct sales  which represent sales made by international smc  and were domestic sales  which represent sales made from our warehouse in the united states 
gross profit gross profit for the fiscal year ended march  was  or of sales as compared to  or of sales for the fiscal year ended march  the decrease in gross margin compared to the prior year is due primarily to the following factors i increased sales from international smc both to domestic and international customers  ii a write down of the value of inventory and iii a reduction of sales due to a guaranteed gross profit agreement with transworld 
international sales were primarily in europe  canada and australia 
sales to international customers historically maintain lower selling prices  and thus  a lower gross profit margin 
the main reason for this is that the sales are made to distributors in those countries and there are no additional variable expenses 
other variable expenses that are seen in conjunction with us sales are advertising allowances  handling charges  returns and commissions 
in fiscal  we entered into a guaranteed gross profit agreement with transworld  a specialty music retailer 
we guaranteed transworld that it would earn a minimum gross profit of  from the sale of our karaoke products during the period between september  through january  under this agreement  we agreed to pay transworld for the difference between the gross profit earned on its sales of our karaoke products and the minimum guarantee 
as of the settlement date of the contract  transworld had not realized the minimum guarantee of gross profit 
as such  we had to provide them with a check in the amount of million  which was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal as a reduction to revenue 
at the end of fiscal  our inventory level was much higher than we had expected 
as of march   we had inventory on hand of million 
we determined that due to liquidation sales  inventory would be sold at a loss  therefore  a decrease in the value of specific inventory items was made 
the total amount of the provision for inventory was  at march  gross profit may not be comparable to those of other entities  since some entities include the costs of warehousing  inspection  freight charges and other distribution costs in their cost of sales 
we account for the above expenses as operating expenses and classify them under selling  general and administrative expenses 
operating expenses operating expenses were  or of total revenues in fiscal up from  or of total revenues  in fiscal the primary factors that contributed to the increase of approximately million in operating expenses for the fiscal year are o increased advertising expenses of  due to increased use of our outside advertising agency to oversee more advertising projects for us  the production of a television commercial  as well as cooperative advertising with customers  which is variable based on the level of sales o the increase in depreciation in the amount of  due to the addition of molds for new product additions for fiscal year  o compensation expense in the amount of  due to the addition of key personnel in florida  at our california facility and at international smc  which include the executive vice president of sales  sales administration  music licensing coordinator  and music production personnel  as well as warehouse employees and repair personnel 
o increased freight and handling charges to customers in the amount of  o expansion of the california warehouse and its associated expenses in the amount of  o expansion of international smc s operations and its related expenses  in the amount of  o increases in product development fees for the development of future product in the amount of  other increases in operating expenses were to selling expenses  which are considered variable 
these expenses are based directly on the level of sales and include royalty expenses and commissions 
we also incurred  of expenses for catalogue expenses and show expenses 
these expenses are not variable and do not change based on the level of sales 
show expenses are costs that are associated with the consumer electronics show and toy fair  such as promotional materials  show space and mock up samples 
our advertising expense increased  for the fiscal year ended march  as compared to fiscal advertising expense consists of two components co operative advertising and direct advertising expense 
co operative advertising is paid directly to the customer and the allowances are based on the amount of sales 
the customer provides copies of advertising on which these funds are spent  but has complete discretion as to the use of these funds 
as we believe that there is a separate and identifiable benefit associated with the co operative advertising  such amounts are recorded as a component of operating expenses 
co operative advertising expenses accounted for  of the increase in advertising expenses 
in fiscal  we embarked on our first television advertising and continued with the use of print advertising  radio spots  sponsorships  promotions and other media 
this is considered direct advertising  whereby we actually contract for advertising of the product 
the increased costs for our advertising firm were  over the prior year 
the expense for direct advertising is at our discretion and is not variable based on the level of sales attained 
both of these types of advertising are direct expenses of the company 
depreciation and amortization our depreciation and amortization expenses were  for the fiscal year ended march  as compared to  for the fiscal year ended march  the increase in depreciation and amortization expenses can be attributed to the company s acquisition of new molds and tooling for our expanded product line  as well as minimal costs for additional computer equipment and furniture for additional personnel 
other expenses net other expenses were  for the fiscal year ended march  as compared with net other expenses of  for the fiscal year ended march  our interest expense increased during the fiscal year ended march  compared to the same period of the prior year primarily due to our increased borrowings under our credit facility with lasalle during this period 
prior to august  we had cash reserves to fund operations and did not need to borrow under our revolving credit facility 
however  in august  we began borrowing our credit facility with lasalle 
our interest income decreased from  during the fiscal year to  during the fiscal year due to our interest earning s cash balance is lower than previous year 
we expect interest expense to increase in fiscal as compared to prior years due to the credit facility accruing interest at a higher rate  effective as of august  when we entered into the fourteenth amendment to our credit facility 
as of december   our credit facility accrued interest at  which is prime plus  our former default rate 
since interest is calculated based on the average monthly balance of the credit facility  we can not reasonably estimate the degree to which this year s expense will exceed last years 
we do know  however  that the interest spread is higher than in the same period last year 
income tax expense our tax expense is based on an aggregation of the taxes on earnings of international smc and our domestic operations 
income tax rates in hong kong are approximately  while the statutory income tax rate in the united states is 
our effective tax rate in fiscal was as compared to in fiscal this decrease in the effective tax rate is a result of our company generating a pretax loss in the united states in fiscal  resulting in a tax benefit  as compared to pretax income in the united states in fiscal our future effective income tax rate will fluctuate based on the level of earnings of international smc and our domestic operations 
net income as a result of the foregoing  our net income was  for the fiscal year ended march  compared to net income of  for fiscal liquidity and capital resources at march   we had cash on hand of  and current assets of  our current assets consist primarily of cash on hand of  restricted cash of  accounts receivable of million  inventories of million  an insurance receivable of  for settlement of the class action lawsuit and a refundable tax credit of million 
as of march   our current liabilities consist of accounts payable of million  accrued expenses of million  customer credit on account of million  a bank overdraft of  subordinated debt of million and an income tax payable of million 
our most significant account payable is a million obligation to a factory in china 
we have agreed to a verbal payment plan with the factory  which provides that we will begin making payments in september the payments will continue through the year end march  we are current on approximately of our accounts payable 
we entered into a factoring agreement with milberg factors  effective as of february  pursuant to the agreement  milberg  at its discretion  will advance us the lesser of of our accounts receivable or million 
all receivables submitted to milberg are subject to a fee equal to of the gross invoice value 
the average monthly balance of the line will incur interest at a rate of prime plus 
other terms of the agreement include minimum fees of  per calendar year and include covenants requiring the singing machine to maintain million of tangible net worth and million of working capital at all times as defined in the agreement 
to secure these advances  milberg received a security interest in all of our accounts receivable and inventory located in the united states and a pledge of of the stock in international smc hk ltd  our wholly owned subsidiary 
this agreement is effective for an initial term of two years  with successive automatic renewals unless either party gives notice of termination 
we borrowed approximately  under the factoring agreement in the fourth quarter of fiscal and repaid all outstanding amounts 
as of march   we did not have any advances outstanding under the factoring agreement  however  we were in violation of the covenants relating to working capital and tangible net worth 
we terminated our factoring agreement with milberg factors  effective as of july  we paid a  fee to terminate this agreement prior to the scheduled expiration date of february  milberg has agreed to release its security interest in all our assets and accounts receivable 
we are now actively seeking financing from other sources 
our hong kong subsidiary  international smc  has access to credit facilities at hong kong shanghai bank and fortis bank 
the primary purpose of the facilities is to provide international smc with access to letters of credit so that it can purchase inventory for direct shipment of goods into the united states and international markets 
the facilities are secured by a corporate guarantee from the us parent company and restricted cash on deposit with the lender 
the maximum available credit under the facilities is million 
the balance at march  and was  and  respectively 
the interest rate is approximate per annum 
as of march  there was no availability under these facilities 
as of june   our cash on hand is limited 
our average monthly operating costs are approximately  and we expect that we will need approximately million for working capital during the next three month period between july and september 
our primary expenses are normal operating costs including salaries  payments under the severance agreements for two of our former executives  lease payments for our warehouse space in compton  california and other operating costs 
on july   a director jay bauer has advanced the company a short term loan of  to be used to meet working capital obligations 
the loan bears interest at per annum and is due on demand 
our commitments for debt and other contractual arrangements are summarized as follows years ending march  total merchandise license guarantee    property leases       equipment leases       subordinated debt related parties   convertible debentures   each of the contractual agreements except the equipment leases provides that all amounts due under that agreement can be accelerated if we default under the terms of the agreement 
for example  if we fail to make a minimum guaranteed royalty payment that is required under a merchandise license agreement on a timely basis  the licensor can declare us in default and require that all amounts due under the merchandise license agreement are immediately due and payable 
merchandise license guarantee reflects amounts that we are obligated to pay as guaranteed royalties under our various license agreements 
in fiscal  we have guaranteed minimum royalty payments under our license agreements with care bears  mtv and motown universal music 
we have leases for office and warehouse space in california  florida and hong kong 
we have equipment leases for forklifts and copy machines 
on september   we issued an aggregate of  of convertible debentures in a private offering to six accredited investors 
the debentures initially are convertible into  shares of our common stock at per share  subject to adjustment in certain situations 
we also issued an aggregate of  warrants to the investors 
the exercise price of the warrants is per share and the warrants expire on september  we have an obligation to register the shares of common stock underlying the debentures and warrants 
on february  we amended our convertible debenture agreements to increase the interest rate to and to grant warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock to the debenture holders on a pro rata basis 
these concessions are in consideration of the debenture holder s agreements to i enter into new subordination agreements with milberg  ii to waive all liquidated damages due under the transaction documents through july  and iii to extend the effective date of the form s registration statement until july  the new warrants have an exercise price equal to per share and the fair value of these warrants was estimated by using the black scholes option pricing model and totaled  this amount was expensed as a component of selling  general and administrative expenses 
pursuant to the convertible debenture agreements  we were required to register the shares of common stock underlying the debentures and detachable stock purchase warrants issued in connection with the debentures 
the registration of the common shares was required to be effective by july  because we did not have the registration statement declared effective by july   we are in technical default of the convertible debenture agreements 
as such  we are accruing liquidated damages in the amount of  per month 
additionally  the convertible debenture holders could declare us in default of the convertible debentures and accelerate all payments due under the convertible debentures  which is the principal amount of million plus any liquidated damages and other fees that are assessed 
one of the reasons that we are in technical default is because we have not received all the information that we have requested from the debenture holders for the registration statement 
we are working to cure our event of default by filing the registration statement as soon as possible 
additionally  we are trying to enter into another amendment of the convertible debentures and transaction documents with the convertible debenture holders which would extend the filing date for the registration statement and eliminate all liquidated damages 
there can be no assurances that we will be able to enter into an amendment of the convertible debenture agreements 
working capital requirements during the short and long term during the three month period between july and september  we plan on financing our working capital needs from i collection of accounts receivable  ii sales of existing inventory  iii seeking additional financial company for advance in account receivables 
iv continued support from factories in china in financing our purchases of karaoke machines for fiscal  and iv utilizing credit facilities that are available to international smc to finance all direct shipments 
our sources of cash for working capital in the longer term  the six month period between september and march  are the same as our sources during the short term 
we expect to receive a tax refund of million at the end of september if we need additional financing we intend to approach milberg and request that it modify the terms of its factoring agreement or permit us to obtain financing from a third party 
however  we can not assure that milberg will be willing to waive any of the conditions of the factoring agreement and or let us seek capital from a third party 
if we need to obtain additional financing and fail to do so  it may have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet our financial obligations and to continue our operations 
during fiscal  we will strive to keep our operating costs at a minimum 
in order to reduce the need to maintain inventory in our warehouse in california and florida  we intend to generate a larger share of our total sales through sales directly from international smc 
the goods are shipped directly to our customers from the ports in china and are primarily backed by customer letters of credit 
the customers take title to the merchandise at their consolidators in china and are responsible for their shipment  duty  clearance and freight charges to their locations 
these sales in which the customer purchase the good for delivery at a specific destination are referred to as fob sales 
we will also assist our customers in the forecasting and management of their inventories of our product 
we are also planning to finance a significant amount of our sales with customer issued letters of credit  using international smc s credit facility with hong kong bank and relying on financing from one of our factories in china 
we anticipate that total purchases of approximately million that will be financed by the above methods 
we currently expect to order approximately million in new inventory  which will be financed by using international smc s credit facility and financing from a chinese factory 
however  these purchase orders can be cancelled at any time prior to delivery and we can not assure you that our customers will complete these purchases 
in the event that we do not sell sufficient products in our second and third quarter  we have considered other sources of financing  such as trying to secure an additional credit facility  private offerings and or a venture capital investment 
we expect that our profit margin for sales of our karaoke products will continue to be under price pressure  because of the older competition in the marketplace 
during fiscal  we plan on introducing three new karaoke machines which will command higher prices and a higher profit margin 
the company also will continue to cut our operating expenses 
we may incur an operating charge in fiscal in connection with the settlement of the class action lawsuit  we have agreed to issue approximately  share of our common stock to the class action plaintiffs 
the convertible debentures and warrants provide that if we issue any additional securities at a price that is lower than the set price of the debentures and the warrants  the price of the debentures and warrants will be adjusted accordingly 
however  there is an exception for the stock issued for acquisitions or strategic investments  the primary purpose of which is not for raise capital 
we believe that the issuance of the securities to the class action plaintiffs may fall with this exception 
we will need to discuss the issue with the institutional investors to see if they agree with our position 
there can be no assurances that they will agree with our position that the conversion price of the debentures and the exercise price of the warrants should not be adjusted 
additionally  we are in default of the convertible debenture agreements and related transaction documents 
under the terms of the convertible debentures  we are accruing liquidated damages of  for each month that we do not have a registration statement filed 
except for the foregoing  we do not have any present commitment that is likely to result in our liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way 
in addition  except for the singing machine s need for additional capital to finance inventory purchases  the singing machine knows of no trend  additional demand  event or uncertainty that will result in  or that is reasonably likely to result in  the singing machine s liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way exchange rates we sell all of our products in us dollars and pay for all of our manufacturing costs in either us or hong kong dollars 
operating expenses of the hong kong office are paid in hong kong dollars 
the exchange rate of the hong kong dollar to the us dollar has been fixed by the hong kong government since at hk to us and  accordingly  has not represented a currency exchange risk to the us dollar 
we cannot assure you that the exchange rate between the united states and hong kong currencies will continue to be fixed or that exchange rate fluctuations will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
seasonal and quarterly results historically  our operations have been seasonal  with the highest net sales occurring in the second and third quarters reflecting increased orders for equipment and music merchandise during the christmas selling months and to a lesser extent the first and fourth quarters of the fiscal year 
sales in our fiscal second and third quarter  combined  accounted for approximately of net sales in fiscal and  and of net sales in fiscal our results of operations may also fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of the amount and timing of orders placed and shipped to customers  as well as other factors 
the fulfillment of orders can therefore significantly affect results of operations on a quarter to quarter basis 
inflation inflation has not had a significant impact on the company s operations 
the company has historically passed any price increases on to its customers since prices charged by the company are generally not fixed by long term contracts 
critical accounting policies we prepared our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
as such  management is required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that it believes are reasonable based on the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the periods presented 
the significant accounting policies which management believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results included accounts receivable allowance for doubtful accounts  reserves on inventory  deferred tax assets and our hong kong income tax exemption 
collectibility of accounts receivable 
the singing machine s allowance for doubtful accounts is based on management s estimates of the creditworthiness of its customers  current economic conditions and historical information  and  in the opinion of management  is believed to be an amount sufficient to respond to normal business conditions 
management sets reserves for customers in bankruptcy and other reserves based upon historical collection experience 
should business conditions deteriorate or any major customer default on its obligations to the company  this allowance may need to be significantly increased  which would have a negative impact on operations 
reserves on inventories 
the singing machine establishes a reserve on inventory based on the expected net realizable value of inventory on an item by item basis when it is apparent that the expected realizable value of an inventory item falls below its original cost 
a charge to cost of sales results when the estimated net realizable value of specific inventory items declines below cost 
management regularly reviews the company s investment in inventories for such declines in value 
income taxes 
significant management judgment is required in developing our provision for income taxes  including the determination of foreign tax liabilities  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances that might be required against the deferred tax assets 
management evaluates its ability to realize its deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis and adjusts its valuation allowance when it believes that it is more likely than not that the asset will not be realized 
at december  and march   we concluded that a valuation allowance was needed against all of our deferred tax assets  as it was not more likely than not that the deferred taxes would be realized 
at march  and  we had gross deferred tax assets of million and million  against which we recorded valuation allowances totaling million and  respectively 
for the fiscal year ended march   we recorded a tax provision of  this occurred because the valuation allowance established against our deferred tax assets exceeded the amount of the benefit created from carrying back a portion of the current year s losses 
the carry back of the losses from the current year resulted in an income tax receivable of million  which is included in refundable tax in the accompanying balance sheets 
we have now exhausted our ability to carry back any further losses and therefore will only be able to recognize tax benefits to the extent that it has future taxable income 
our subsidiary has applied for an exemption of income tax in hong kong 
therefore  no taxes have been expensed or provided for at the subsidiary level 
although no decision has been reached by the governing body  the parent company has reached the decision to provide for the possibility that the exemption could be denied and accordingly has recorded a provision for hong kong taxes in fiscal and there was no provision for hong kong income taxes in fiscal due to the subsidiary s net operating loss for the year 
hong kong income taxes payable totaled million at march  and and is included in the accompanying balance sheets as income taxes payable 
we effectively repatriated approximately million  million and from its foreign operations in  and  respectively 
accordingly  these earnings were taxed as a deemed dividend based on us statutory rates 
we have no remaining undistributed earnings of the company s foreign subsidiary 
we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in those jurisdictions 
because of the complex issues involved  any claims can require an extended period to resolve 
in management s opinion  adequate provisions for income taxes have been made 
other estimates 
we makes other estimates in the ordinary course of business relating to sales returns and allowances  warranty reserves  and reserves for promotional incentives 
historically  past changes to these estimates have not had a material impact on our financial condition 
however  circumstances could change which may alter future expectations 
set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report on form k and in the other documents we file with the sec are risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward looking statements contained in this annual report 
factors that may affect future results and market price of stock risks associated with our business we have significant working capital needs and if we are unable to obtain additional financing  when needed  we may not have sufficient cash flow to run our business as of july   our cash on hand is limited 
we need approximately million in working capital in order to finance our operations over the next three months 
we will finance our working capital needs from the collection of accounts receivable  and sales of existing inventory 
see liquidity beginning on page as of march   our inventory was valued at million 
if these sources do not provide us with adequate financing  we may try to seek financing from a third party 
if we are not able to obtain adequate financing  when needed  it will have a material adverse effect on our cash flow and our ability to run our business 
if we have a severe shortage of working capital  we may not be able to continue our business operations and may be required to file a petition for bankruptcy under chapter of the us bankruptcy code or enter into some other form of liquidation or reorganization proceeding 
we may be deemed to insolvent and we may go out of business as of march   our cash position is limited 
we are not able to pay all of our creditors on a timely basis 
we are current on approximately of our accounts payable  which total million as march  we are not current on our account payable of million to our factory in china 
if we are not able to pay our current debts as they become due  we may be deemed to be insolvent 
we may be required to file a petition for bankruptcy under chapter of the us bankruptcy code or enter into some other form of liquidation or reorganization proceedings 
our independent registered public accountanting firm raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern as of march  and we received a report dated june  from our independent certified public accountants covering the consolidated financial statements for our fiscal year ended march  that included an explanatory paragraph which stated that the financial statements were prepared assuming the singing machine would continue as a going concern 
this report stated that our operating performance in fiscal and our minimal liquidity raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
if we are not able to raise additional capital  we may need to curtail or stop our business operations 
we may be required to file a petition for bankruptcy under chapter of the us bankruptcy code or enter into some other form of liquidation or reorganization proceedings 
we are in technical default of the terms of the convertible debentures and there could be a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results if we are deemed to be in default we are in technical default of the terms of the million in convertible debentures that we issued to institutional investors in september we had an obligation to have the registration statement registering the securities issued to the institutional investors filed and declared effective by july  as of july   the registration statement has not been declared effective 
as such  under the terms of the registration rights agreement we are accruing liquidated damages in the amount of  for each month that the registration statement is not declared effective 
additionally  the institutional investors could declare us in default of the convertible debentures and demand repayment of the debentures and all other amounts due under the transaction documents evidencing their million investment 
if we are unable to effectively and efficiently implement our plan to remediate the material weaknesses which have been identified in our internal controls and procedures  there could be a material adverse effect on our operations or financial results we have identified a number of material weaknesses in our internal controls and procedures in connection with the audit of our financial statements for fiscal see controls and procedures on page the deficiencies in our internal controls relate to weaknesses in our financial reporting processes as a result of a lack of adequate staffing in the accounting department  accounting for consigned inventory and inventory costing 
we are implementing a number of procedures to correct these weaknesses in our internal controls 
however  no assurances can be given that we will be able to successfully implement our revised internal controls and procedures or that our revised controls and procedures will be effective in remedying all of the identified material weaknesses in our prior controls and procedures 
in addition  we may be required to hire additional employees  and may experience higher than anticipated capital expenditures and operating expenses  during our implementation of these changes 
if we are unable to implement these changes effectively or efficiently there could be a material adverse effect on our operations or financial results 
a small number of our customers account for a substantial portion of our revenues  and the loss of one or more of these key customers could significantly reduce our revenues and cash flow we rely on a few large customers to provide a substantial portion of our revenues 
as a percentage of total revenues  our net sales to our five largest customers during the fiscal period ended march   and were approximately  and  respectively 
in fiscal  three customers accounted for  and of our net sales 
the customers are arbiter  giochi and best buy respectively 
we do not have long term contractual arrangements with any of our customers and they can cancel their orders at any time prior to delivery 
a substantial reduction in or termination of orders from any of our largest customers would decrease our revenues and cash flow 
we are relying on one factory to manufacture and produce the majority of our karaoke machines for fiscal  and if the relationship with this factory is damaged or injured in any way  it would reduces our revenues and profitability we have worked out a verbal agreement with a factory in china to produce all of our karaoke machines for fiscal we owe this factory approximately million as of june  and have worked out a payment plan with it 
see liquidity beginning on page if the factory is unwilling or unable to deliver our karaoke machines to us  our business will be adversely affected 
because our cash on hand is minimal  we are relying on revenues received from the sale of our ordered karaoke machines to provide cash flow for our operations 
if we do not receive cash from these sales  we may not be able to continue our business operations 
we are subject to the risk that some of our large customers may return karaoke products that they have purchased from us and if this happens  it would reduce our revenues and profitability in fiscal and  a number of our customers and distributors returned karaoke products that they had purchased from us 
our customers returned goods valued at million  or of our net sales in fiscal best buy  one of our largest customers  returned approximately million in karaoke products that it had not been able to sell during the christmas season in fiscal best buy agreed to keep this inventory in its retail stores  but converted the sale to a consignment sale 
although we were not contractually obligated to accept this return of the karaoke products in fiscal or fiscal  we accepted the return of the karaoke products because we valued our relationship with our customers 
because we are dependent upon a few large customers  we are subject to the risk that any of these customers may elect to return unsold karaoke products to us in the future 
if any of our customers were to return karaoke products to us  it would reduce our revenues and profitability 
we are subject to pressure from our customers relating to price reduction and financial incentives and if we are pressured to make these concessions to our customers  it will reduce our revenues and profitability because there is intense competition in the karaoke industry  we are subject to pricing pressure from our customers 
many of our customers have demanded that we lower our prices or they will buy our competitor s products 
if we do not meet our customer s demands for lower prices  we will not sell as many karaoke products 
in our fiscal year ended march   our sales to customers in the united states decreased because of increased price competition 
during fiscal  we sold of our karaoke machines at prices that were equal to or below cost 
we will not be able to stay in business if we continue to sell our karaoke machines at prices that are at or below cost 
we are also subject to pressure from our customers regarding certain financial incentives  such as return credits or large advertising or cooperative advertising allowances  which effectively reduce our selling prices 
in fiscal  we gave our customers million of credit on account because the sell through of our products was not as strong as we had expected 
we also gave them advertising allowances in the amount of million during fiscal and million during fiscal we have historically offered advertising allowances to our customers because it is standard practice in the retail industry 
we experience difficulty forecasting the demand for our karaoke products and if we do not accurately forecast demand  our revenues  net income and cash flow may be affected because of our reliance on manufacturers in asia for our machine production  our production lead times range from one to four months 
therefore  we must commit to production in advance of customers orders 
it is difficult to forecast customer demand because we do not have any scientific or quantitative method to predict this demand 
our forecasting is based on management s general expectations about customer demand  the general strength of the retail market and management s historical experiences 
we overestimated demand for our products in fiscal and had million in inventory as of march  because of this excess inventory  we had liquidity problems in fiscal and our revenues  net income and cash flow were adversely affected 
we had a net loss of million in fiscal and our cash flow was limited in fiscal we are subject to the costs and risks of carrying inventory for our customers and if we have too much inventory  it will affect our revenues and net income many of our customers place orders with us several months prior to the holiday season  but they schedule delivery two or three weeks before the holiday season begins 
as such  we are subject to the risks and costs of carrying inventory during the time period between the placement or the order and the delivery date  which reduces our cash flow 
as of march   we had million in inventory on hand  which impacted our cash flow and liquidity from operations in fiscal as of march   our inventory was valued at million  after a million reserve had been taken 
it is important that we sell this inventory during fiscal  so we have sufficient cash flow for operations 
our gross profit margins have decreased over the past year and we expect competitive market over the past year  our gross profit margins have decreased 
in the fiscal year ended march   our gross profit margin was of net sales compared to of net sales in fiscal year ended march  this decline resulted from the closeout of older models and excessive inventory  price competition and increased sales by international smc 
sales made by international smc increased from of our sale in fiscal to in fiscal international smc delivers our karaoke products to customers directly from our manufacturer s factories in china and therefore does not provide logistics  handling  warehousing and just in time inventory support  which services are provided by our parent company in the united states 
accordingly  the average sales price per unit realized by international smc is significantly lower than that of our parent company in the united states 
we expect further price competition and a continuing shift of sales volume to international smc 
accordingly  we expect that our gross profit margin will decrease in fiscal our senior corporate management team is new to the singing machine and is required to devote significant attention to our financing agreements and settling our class action lawsuits beginning on may   through the present date  four of our executive officers have resigned we hired a new chief operating officer  yi ping chan on april   and a new chief financial officer  jeff barocas  on april  three new directors have joined our board since october  and one of them has resigned since that date 
bernard appel joined our board effective as of october and harvey judkowitz joined on march  richard ekstract jointed our board on october  and resigned for personal reasons on june  we are in the process of searching for a new chief executive officer and new directors 
it will take some time for our new management and our new board of directors to learn about our business and to develop strong working relationships with each other and our employees 
our new senior corporate management s ability to complete this process has been and continues to be hindered by the time that it needs to devote to other pressing business matters 
new management needs to spend significant time on overseeing our liquidity situation and overseeing legal matters  such as our class action lawsuit 
we cannot assure you that this major restructuring of our board of directors and senior management and the accompanying distractions  in this environment  will not adversely affect our results of operations 
the sec is conducting an informal investigation of the company and if we have done something illegal  we will be subject to fines  penalties and other sanctions by the sec in august  we were advised that the sec had commenced an informal investigation of our company 
it appears that the investigation is focused on the restatement of our financial statements in fiscal and  however  the sec may be reviewing other issues as well 
if the sec finds that our company has not fully complied with all applicable federal securities laws  we could be subject to fines  penalties and other sanctions imposed by the sec 
we are named as a defendant in a class action lawsuit relating to the restatement of our financial statements for fiscal and fiscal  which if determined adversely to us  could result in the imposition of damages against us and harm our business and financial condition we are named as a defendant in a class action lawsuit which arose from the restatement of our financial statements for fiscal and in this lawsuit  the plaintiffs allege that our executive officers and our company violated section b and section a of the securities exchange act of and rule b the plaintiffs seek compensatory damages  attorney s fees and injunctive relief 
while the specific factual allegations vary slightly in each case  the complaints generally allege that our officers falsely represented the company s financial results during the relevant class periods 
in march  we have entered into a settlement agreement with the class action plaintiffs 
see business legal matters 
this settlement is subject to approval by the court and the shareholders who are members of the class action lawsuit at a hearing which will be held on july  if this settlement agreement is not approved by the court and members of the class action lawsuit  we will need to expend additional times and resources on resolving this matter  whether through continued settlement discussions or through litigation 
if a significant monetary judgment is rendered against us  we are not certain that we will have the ability to pay such a judgment 
any losses resulting from these claims could adversely affect our profitability and cash flow 
our licensing agreement with mtv networks is important to our business and if we were to lose out mtv license it would affect our revenues and profitability our license with mtv networks is important to our business 
we generated and of our consolidated net sales from products sold under the mtv license in fiscal and  respectively 
our mtv license was extended until july  with options for mtv to renew for an additional four months period through december  if we were to lose our mtv license  it would have an effect on our revenues and net income 
our business is seasonal and therefore our annual operating results will depend  in large part  on our sales during the relatively brief holiday season sales of consumer electronics and toy products in the retail channel are highly seasonal  with a majority of retail sales occurring during the period from september through december in anticipation of the holiday season  which includes christmas 
a substantial majority of our sales occur during the second quarter ended september and the third quarter ended december sales in our second and third quarter  combined  accounted for approximately of net sales in fiscal  and and of net sales in fiscal if we are unable to compete in the karaoke products category  our revenues and net profitability will be reduced our major competitors for karaoke machines and related products are craig and memorex 
we believe that competition for karaoke machines is based primarily on price  product features  reputation  delivery times  and customer support 
our primary competitors for producing karaoke music are compass  pocket songs  sybersound  uav and sound choice 
we believe that competition for karaoke music is based primarily on popularity of song titles  price  reputation  and delivery times 
to the extent that we lower prices to attempt to enhance or retain market share  we may adversely impact our operating margins 
conversely  if we opt not to match competitor s price reductions we may lose market share  resulting in decreased volume and revenue 
to the extent our leading competitors reduce prices on their karaoke machines and music  we must remain flexible to reduce our prices 
if we are forced to reduce our prices  it will result in lower margins and reduced profitability 
because of intense competition in the karaoke industry in the united states during fiscal  we expect that the intense pricing pressure in the low end of the market will continue in the karaoke market in the united states in fiscal in addition  we must compete with all the other existing forms of entertainment including  but not limited to motion pictures  video arcade games  home video games  theme parks  nightclubs  television and prerecorded tapes  cd s and video cassettes 
if we are unable to develop new karaoke products  our revenues may not continue to grow the karaoke industry is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions and enhancements and ongoing customer demands for greater performance 
in addition  the average selling price of any karaoke machine has historically decreased over its life  and we expect that trend to continue 
as a result  our products may not be competitive if we fail to introduce new products or product enhancements that meet evolving customer demands 
the development of new products is complex  and we may not be able to complete development in a timely manner  or at all 
edward steele  our former chief executive officer  has overseen our product development for the past twelve years 
mr 
steele currently serves as a senior advisor and director of product development under a contract which expires on february  we have not yet identified a successor who will oversee product development if mr 
steele were to leave our company 
to introduce products on a timely basis  we must o accurately define and design new products to meet market needs  o design features that continue to differentiate our products from those of our competitors  o transition our products to new manufacturing process technologies  o identify emerging technological trends in our target markets  o anticipate changes in end user preferences with respect to our customers products  o bring products to market on a timely basis at competitive prices  and o respond effectively to technological changes or product announcements by others 
we believe that we will need to continue to enhance our karaoke machines and develop new machines to keep pace with competitive and technological developments and to achieve market acceptance for our products 
our products are shipped from china and any disruption of shipping could prevent or delay our customers receipt of inventory we rely principally on four contract ocean carriers to ship virtually all of the products that we import to our warehouse facility in compton california 
retailers that take delivery of our products in china rely on a variety of carriers to import those products 
any disruptions in shipping  whether in california or china  caused by labor strikes  other labor disputes  terrorism  and international incidents or otherwise prevent or delay our customers receipt of inventory 
if our customers do not receive their inventory on a timely basis  they may cancel their orders or return products to us 
consequently  our revenues and net income would be reduced 
our manufacturing operations are located in the people s republic of china  subjecting us to risks common in international operations 
if there is any problem with the manufacturing process  our revenues and net profitability may be reduced 
we are dependent upon six factories in the people s republic of china to manufacture the majority of our karaoke machines 
these factories will be producing approximately of our karaoke products in fiscal we do not have written agreements with any of these factories 
our arrangements with these factories are subject to the risks of doing business abroad  such as import duties  trade restrictions  work stoppages  and foreign currency fluctuations  limitations on the repatriation of earnings and political instability  which could have an adverse impact on our business 
furthermore  we have limited control over the manufacturing processes themselves 
as a result  any difficulties encountered by our third party manufacturers that result in product defects  production delays  cost overruns or the inability to fulfill orders on a timely basis could adversely affect our revenues  profitability and cash flow 
also  since we do not have written agreements with any of these factories  we are subject to additional uncertainty if the factories do not deliver products to us on a timely basis 
we depend on third party suppliers for parts for our karaoke machines and related products  and if we cannot obtain supplies as needed  our operations will be severely damaged our growth and ability to meet customer demand depends in part on our capability to obtain timely deliveries of karaoke machines and our electronic products 
we rely on third party suppliers to produce the parts and materials we use to manufacture and produce these products 
if our suppliers are unable to provide our factories with the parts and supplies  we will be unable to produce our products 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to purchase the parts we need at reasonable prices or in a timely fashion 
in the last several years  there have been shortages of certain chips that we use in our karaoke machines 
if we are unable to anticipate any shortages of parts and materials in the future  we may experience severe production problems  which would impact our sales 
consumer discretionary spending may affect karaoke purchases and is affected by various economic conditions and changes our business and financial performance may be damaged more than most companies by adverse financial conditions affecting our business or by a general weakening of the economy 
purchases of karaoke machines and music are considered discretionary for consumers 
our success will therefore be influenced by a number of economic factors affecting discretionary and consumer spending  such as employment levels  business  interest rates  and taxation rates  all of which are not under our control 
additionally  other extraordinary events such as terrorist attacks or military engagements  which adversely affect the retail environment may restrict consumer spending and thereby adversely affect our sales growth and profitability 
we may have infringed the copyrights of certain music publishers and if we violate federal copyright laws  we will be subject to monetary penalties over the past several years  we have received notices from several music publishers who have alleged that we did not have the proper copyright licenses to sell certain songs included in our compact discs with graphics discs cdg s 
cdg s are compact discs which contain the musical recordings of the karaoke songs and graphics which contain the lyrics of the songs 
we have settled or are in the process of settling all of these copyright infringement issues with these publishers 
we have spent approximately  to settle these copyright infringement suits in fiscal year and these copyright infringement claims may have a negative effect on our ability to sell our music products to our customers 
if we do not have the proper copyright licenses for any other songs that are included in our cd g s and cassettes  we will be subject to additional liability under the federal copyright laws  which could include settlements with the music publishers and payment of monetary damages 
we may be subject to claims from third parties for unauthorized use of their proprietary technology  copyrights or trade secrets and any claims asserted against us could affect our net profitability we believe that we independently developed the technology used in our electronic and audio software products and that it does not infringe on the proprietary rights  copyrights or trade secrets of others 
however  we cannot assure you that we have not infringed on the proprietary rights of third parties or those third parties will not make infringement violation claims against us 
during fiscal  tanashin denki  ltd  a japanese company that holds a patent on a cassette tape drive mechanism alleged that some of our karaoke machines violated their patents 
we settled the matters with tanashin in december subsequently in december  tanashin again alleged that some of our karaoke machines violated their patents 
we entered into another settlement agreement with them in may in addition to tanashin  we could receive infringement claims from other third parties 
any infringement claims may have a negative effect on our profitability and financial condition 
we are exposed to the credit risk of our customers  who are experiencing financial difficulties  and if these customers are unable to pay us  our revenues and profitability will be reduced we sell products to retailers  including department stores  lifestyle merchants  direct mail retailers  which are catalogs and showrooms  national chains  specialty stores  and warehouse clubs 
some of these retailers  such as k mart  fao schwarz and kb toys  have engaged in leveraged buyouts or transactions in which they incurred a significant amount of debt  and operated under the protection of bankruptcy laws 
as of june   we are aware of only two customers  fao schwarz and kb toys  which are operating under the protection of bankruptcy laws 
deterioration in the financial condition of our customers could result in bad debt expense to us and have a material adverse effect on our revenues and future profitability 
a disruption in the operation of our warehouse centers in california or florida could impact our ability to deliver merchandise to our stores  which could adversely affect our revenues and profitability a significant amount of our merchandise is shipped to our customers from one of our two warehouses  which are located in compton  california  and coconut creek  florida 
events such as fire or other catastrophic events  any malfunction or disruption of our centralized information systems or shipping problems may result in delays or disruptions in the timely distribution of merchandise to our customers  which could substantially decrease our revenues and profitability 
our business operations could be disrupted if there are labor problems on the west coast during fiscal  approximately of our sales were domestic warehouse sales  which were made from our warehouses in california and florida 
during the third quarter of fiscal  the dock strike on the west coast affected sales of two of our karaoke products and we estimate that we lost between and million in orders because we couldn t get the containers of these products off the pier 
if another strike or work slow down occurs and we do not have a sufficient level of inventory  a strike or work slow down would result in increased costs to us and may reduce our profitability 
the market price of our common stock may be volatile which may cause investors to lose all or a portion of their investment from june  through june   our common stock has traded between a high of and a low of 
during this period  we have restated our earnings  lost senior executives and board members  had liquidity problems  and incurred a net loss of million in fiscal our stock price may continue to be volatile based on similar or other adverse developments in our business 
in addition  the stock market periodically experiences significant adverse price and volume fluctuations which may be unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
if investors short our securities  it may cause our stock price to decline during the past year  a number of investors have held a short position in our common stock 
as of july   investors hold a short position in  shares of our common stock which represents of our public float 
the anticipated downward pressure on our stock price due to actual or anticipated sales of our stock by some institutions or individuals who engage in short sales of our common stock could cause our stock price to decline 
additionally  if our stock price declines  it may be more difficult for us to raise capital 
our obligation to make severance payments could prevent or delay takeovers our employment agreement with yi ping chan requires us  under certain conditions  to make substantial severance payments to him if he resigns after a change of control 
as of march   mr 
chan is entitled to severance payments of  these provisions could delay or impede a merger  tender offer or other transaction resulting in a change in control of the singing machine  even if such a transaction would have significant benefits to our shareholders 
as a result  these provisions could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
see executive compensation employment agreements on page risks associated with our capital structure our common stock may be delisted from the american stock exchange  which may have a material adverse impact on the pricing and trading of our common stock our common stock is quoted on the american stock exchange amex 
the amex  as a matter of policy  will consider the suspension of trading in  or removal from listing of  any stock when  in the opinion of amex  i the financial condition and or operating results of an issuer appear to be unsatisfactory  ii it appears that the extent of public distribution or the aggregate market value of the stock has become so reduced as to make further dealings on the amex inadvisable  iii the issuer has sold or otherwise disposed of its principal operating assets  or iv the issuer has sustained losses which are so substantial in relation to its overall operations or its existing financial condition has become so impaired that it appears questionable  in the opinion of amex  whether the issuer will be able to continue operations and or meet its obligations as they mature 
as of june   we have not received any notices from amex notifying us that they will delist us 
however  we cannot assure you that amex will not take any actions in the near future to delist our common stock 
if our common stock were delisted from the amex  we would trade on the over the counter bulletin board and the market price for shares or our common stock could decline 
further  if our common stock is removed from listing on amex  it may become more difficult for us to raise funds through the sale of our common stock or securities convertible into our common stock 
if our outstanding derivative securities are exercised or converted  our existing shareholders will suffer dilution as of march   there were outstanding stock options to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock at exercise prices ranging from to per share  not all of which are immediately exercisable 
the weighted average exercise price of the outstanding stock options is approximately per share 
as of march   there were outstanding immediately exercisable option to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock 
there were outstanding stock warrants to purchase  shares of common stock at exercise prices ranging from to per share  all of which are exercisable 
the weighted average exercise price of the outstanding stock warrants is approximately per share 
in addition  we have issued  of convertible debentures  which are initially convertible into an aggregate of  shares of common stock 
to the extent that the aforementioned convertible securities are exercised or converted  dilution to our stockholders will occur 
the million private placement that we closed in september will affect our ability to raise capital in the future on september   we closed a private offering in which we issued million of convertible debentures and stock purchase warrants to six institutional investors 
as part of this investment  we agreed to several limitations on our corporate actions  some of which limit our ability to raise financing in the future 
if we enter into any financing transactions during the one year period prior to september   we need to offer the institutional investors the right to participate in such offering in an amount equal to the greater of a the principal amount of the debentures currently outstanding or b of the financing offered to the outside investment group 
for example  if we offer to sell million worth of our securities to an outside investment group  the institutional investors will have the right to purchase up to million of the offering 
this right may affect our ability to attract other investors if we require external financing to remain in operations 
furthermore  for a period of days after the effective date of the registration statement registering shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the convertible debentures and the warrants  we cannot sell any securities 
additionally  we can not o sell any of our securities in any transactions where the exercise price is adjusted based on the trading price of our common stock at any time after the initial issuance of such securities 
o sell any securities which grant investors the right to receive additional shares based on any future transaction on terms more favorable than those granted to the investor in the initial offering these limitations are in place until the earlier of february  or the date on which all the debentures are converted into shares of our common stock 
if we sell any of our securities at a price lower than per share  the conversion price of our debentures at per share will be reduced and there will be additional dilution to our shareholders given that our common stock is trading at a price of per share as of june   it is possible that we may need to sell additional securities for capital at a price lower than per share 
if we sell any securities at a price lower than per share  the conversion price of our debentures currently set at per share will be reduced and there will be more dilution to our shareholders if and when the debentures are converted into shares of our common stock 
if we issue or sell any securities at a price less than per share prior to september   the set price of the debentures will be reduced by an amount equal to of the difference between the set price and the effective purchase price for the shares if such dilutive issuances occur after september  but before the earlier of february  or when all the debentures are converted into shares of our common stock  the set price will be reduced by an amount equal to of the difference between the set price and effective purchase price of such shares 
so  if we sold million shares of our common stock on june  for a price of per share  the set price of the debentures would be reduced by to and the aggregate number of shares of our common stock that would be issued upon conversion of the debentures would be increased from  shares to  shares 
if the price of our securities continues to decrease  and we continue to issue or sell our securities at price below per share  our obligation to issue shares upon conversion of the debentures is essentially limitless 
future sales of our common stock held by current stockholders and investors may depress our stock price as of march   there were  shares of our common stock outstanding 
of these shares  approximately  shares are eligible for sale under rule we have filed two registration statements registering an aggregate  of shares of our common stock a registration statement on form s to register the sale of  shares underlying options granted under our stock option plan and a registration statement on form s to register  shares of our common stock underlying options granted under our year stock option plan 
an additional registration statement on form s  of which this prospectus is a part  was filed in october  registering an aggregate of  shares of our common stock 
the market price of our common stock could drop due to the sale of large number of shares of our common stock  such as the shares sold pursuant to the registration statements or under rule  or the perception that these sales could occur 
our stock price may decrease if we issue additional shares of our common stock our certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of  shares of common stock 
as of march   we had  shares of common stock issued and outstanding and an aggregate of  shares issuable under our outstanding options and warrants 
we also have an obligation to issue up to  shares upon conversion of our debentures and have reserved  additional shares for interest payment on the debentures 
as such  our board of directors has the power  without stockholder approval  to issue up to  shares of common stock 
any issuance of additional shares of common stock  whether by us to new stockholders or the exercise of outstanding warrants or options  may result in a reduction of the book value or market price of our outstanding common stock 
issuance of additional shares will reduce the proportionate ownership and voting power of our then existing stockholders 
provisions in our charter documents and delaware law make it difficult for a third party to acquire our company and could depress the price of our common stock delaware law and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could delay  defer or prevent a change in control of our company or a change in our management 
these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions 
these provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation include authorizing our board of directors to issue additional preferred stock  limiting the persons who may call special meetings of stockholders  and establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position  results of operations or cash flows due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices and interest rates 
we are exposed to market risk in the areas of changes in united states and international borrowing rates and changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
in addition  we are exposed to market risk in certain geographic areas that have experienced or remain vulnerable to an economic downturn  such as china 
we purchase substantially all our inventory from companies in china  and  therefore  we are subject to the risk that such suppliers will be unable to provide inventory at competitive prices 
while we believe that  if such an event were to occur we would be able to find alternative sources of inventory at competitive prices  we cannot assure you that we would be able to do so 
these exposures are directly related to our normal operating and funding activities 
historically and as of march   we have not used derivative instruments or engaged in hedging activities to minimize market risk 
interest rate risk as or march   we do not have any exposure to market risk resulting from changes in interest rates 
we have million in convertible notes  which have a fixed interest rate of effective as of february  foreign currency risk we have a wholly owned subsidiary in hong kong 
sales by these operations made on a fob china or hong kong basis are dominated in us dollars 
however  purchases of inventory and hong kong operating expenses are typically denominated in hong kong dollars  thereby creating exposure to changes in exchange rates 
changes in the hong kong dollar us dollar exchange rates may positively or negatively affect our gross margins  operating income and retained earnings 
we do not believe that near term changes in the exchange rates  if any  will result in a material effect on our future earnings  fair values or cash flows  and therefore  we have chosen not to enter into foreign currency hedging transactions 
we cannot assure you that this approach will be successful  especially in the event of a significant and sudden change in the value of the hong kong dollar
