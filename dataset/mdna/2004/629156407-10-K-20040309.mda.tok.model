item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates the accompanying management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventory reserves  impairments of investments in marketable securities and investments accounted for by the equity method  the recoverability of other long lived assets including goodwill and other intangible assets  pension and other post retirement benefit obligations and the underlying actuarial assumptions related thereto  the realization of deferred income tax assets and accruals for environmental remediation  litigation  income tax and other contingencies 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
actual results may differ from previously estimated amounts under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements o the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments and other factors 
the company takes into consideration the current financial condition of its customers  the age of the outstanding balance and the current economic environment when assessing the adequacy of the allowance 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
during  and  the net amount written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of the balance of the allowance for doubtful accounts as of the beginning of the year ranged from to 
o the company provides reserves for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated net realizable value using assumptions about future demand for its products and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory reserves may be required 
the company also provides reserves for tools and supplies inventory based generally on both historical and expected future usage requirements 
o the company owns investments in certain companies that are accounted for either as marketable securities carried at fair value or accounted for under the equity method 
for all of such investments  the company records an impairment charge when it believes an investment has experienced a decline in fair value below its cost basis for marketable securities or below its carrying value for equity method investees that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
at december   the carrying value of all of the company s marketable securities exceeded the cost basis of each of such investments 
with respect to the company s investment in valhi  which represented over of the carrying value of all of the company s marketable equity securities at december   the million carrying value of such investment exceeded its million cost basis by about 
o the company recognizes an impairment charge associated with its long lived assets  including property and equipment  goodwill and other intangible assets  whenever it determines that recovery of such long lived asset is not probable 
such determination is made in accordance with the applicable gaap requirements associated with the long lived asset  and is based upon  among other things  estimates of the amount of future net cash flows to be generated by the long lived asset and estimates of the current fair value of the asset 
adverse changes in such estimates of future net cash flows or estimates of fair value could result in an inability to recover the carrying value of the long lived asset  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge to be recognized in the future 
under applicable gaap sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  property and equipment is not assessed for impairment unless certain impairment indicators  as defined  are present 
during  no such impairment indicators  as defined  were present 
under applicable gaap sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is required to be reviewed for impairment at least on an annual basis 
goodwill will also be reviewed for impairment at other times during each year when impairment indicators  as defined  are present 
the company s goodwill relates to an acquisition completed in january no goodwill impairments were deemed to exist as a result of the company s annual impairment review completed during the third quarter of o the company maintains various defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefits other than pensions opeb 
the amount recognized as defined benefit pension and opeb expense  and the reported amount of prepaid and accrued pension costs and accrued opeb costs  are actuarially determined based on several assumptions  including discount rates  expected rates of returns on plan assets and expected health care trend rates 
variances from these actuarially assumed rates will result in increases or decreases  as applicable  in the recognized pension and opeb obligations  pension and opeb expense and funding requirements 
these assumptions are more fully described below under assumptions on defined benefit pension plans and opeb plans 
o the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred income tax assets to the amount that is believed to be realized under the more likely than not recognition criteria 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  it is possible that in the future the company may change its estimate of the amount of the deferred income tax assets that would more likely than not be realized in the future  resulting in an adjustment to the deferred income tax asset valuation allowance that would either increase or decrease  as applicable  reported net income in the period such change in estimate was made 
o the company records accruals for environmental  legal  income tax and other contingencies when estimated future expenditures associated with such contingencies become probable  and the amounts can be reasonably estimated 
however  new information may become available  or circumstances such as applicable laws and regulations may change  thereby resulting in an increase or decrease in the amount required to be accrued for such matters and therefore a decrease or increase in reported net income in the period of such change 
executive summary relative changes in the company s tio sales and operating income during the past three years are primarily due to i relative changes in tio sales and production volumes  ii relative changes in tio average selling prices and iii relative changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the relatively lower levels of sales and production volumes in as compared to and are due in part to the effects of a fire at one of the company s production facilities  as discussed below 
selling prices for tio  the company s principal product  were generally decreasing during all of and the first quarter of  were generally flat during the second quarter of  were generally increasing during the last half of and the first quarter of  were generally flat during the second quarter of and were generally declining during the third and fourth quarters of as described in item legal proceedings and note to the consolidated financial statements  the company is involved in various legal proceedings 
such proceedings include lead pigment litigation resulting from the company s former operations  environmental matters and litigation associated with the company s current and former operating facilities along with various other environmental  contractual  product liability and other claims and disputes incidental to its present and former businesses

excluding the effect of fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies  the company s average tio selling price in was higher than  primarily due to the european and export markets 
when translated from billing currencies to us dollars using actual foreign currency exchange rates prevailing during the respective periods  the company s average tio selling prices in increased compared to the company s tio sales volumes in set a new record  increasing from the previous record achieved in  with higher volumes in european and north american markets more than offsetting a decline in volumes to export markets 
by volume  approximately one half of nl s and tio sales volumes were attributable to markets in europe  with attributable to north america and the balance to export markets 
the company s sales are denominated in various currencies  including the us dollar  the euro  other major european currencies and the canadian dollar 
the disclosure of the percentage change in the company s average tio selling price in billing currencies which excludes the effects of fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies is considered a non gaap financial measure under regulations of the sec 
the disclosure of the percentage change in the company s average tio selling prices using actual foreign currency exchange rates prevailing during the respective periods is considered the most directly comparable financial measure presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap measure 
the company discloses percentage changes in its average tio prices in billing currencies because the company believes such disclosure provides useful information to investors to allow them to analyze such changes without the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  thereby facilitating period to period comparisons of the relative changes in average selling prices in the actual various billing currencies 
generally  when the us dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies  the percentage change in average selling prices in billing currencies will be higher or lower  respectively  than such percentage changes would be using actual exchange rates prevailing during the respective periods 
the difference between the increase in the company s average tio selling prices during as compared to using actual foreign currency exchange rates prevailing during the respective periods the gaap measure and the percentage increase in the company s average tio selling price in billing currencies the non gaap measure during such periods is due to the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the table above presents i the percentage change in the company s average tio selling prices using actual foreign currency exchange rates prevailing during the respective periods the gaap measure  ii the percentage change in kronos average tio selling price in billing currencies the non gaap measure and iii the percentage change due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates or the reconciling item between the non gaap measure and the gaap measure 
the company s cost of sales increased million in compared to due to the higher sales volumes 
the company s cost of sales  as a percentage of net sales  decreased from in to in due primarily to the effects of continued cost reduction efforts combined with the impact of higher production volumes and higher average selling prices 
operating rates were near full capacity during most of  setting a new company production record 
the company s gross margins increased million from to due to the net effects of the aforementioned changes in sales and cost of sales during such periods 
as a percentage of net sales  selling general and administrative expenses remained consistent at  increasing proportionately with the increased sales and production volume 
certain of the sales generated by the company s european and canadian operations are denominated in the us dollar  and such operations routinely hold us dollar denominated receivables 
primarily as a result of the weakening of the us dollar as compared to the canadian dollar and the euro throughout the year  the company s results in included net currency transaction losses of million 
due to a more stable dollar in  the company recognized net currency transaction losses of approximately  the gain on disposal of property and equipment in related primarily to the disposal of certain real property not associated with the company s tio operations  and aggregated million 
the company has certain other real property  including some subject to environmental remediation  which could be sold in the future for a profit 
the litigation settlement gains relate to legal settlements with certain of the company s former insurance carriers 
the noncompete agreement income related to a covenant not to compete involving a formerly owned business unit  which became fully amortized in january corporate expenses for increased to million as compared to primarily due to higher environmental remediation expense accruals principally related to one formerly owned site for which the remediation process is expected to occur over the next several years 
kronos has substantial operations and assets located outside the united states primarily in germany  belgium  norway and canada 
a significant amount of kronos sales generated from its non us operations are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  principally the euro  other major european currencies and the canadian dollar 
a portion of kronos sales generated from its non us operations are denominated in the non us dollar 
certain raw materials  primarily titanium containing feedstocks  are purchased in us dollars  while labor and other production costs are denominated primarily in local currencies 
consequently  the translated us dollar value of kronos foreign sales and operating results are subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations which may favorably or adversely impact reported earnings and may affect the comparability of period to period operating results 
overall  fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies  primarily the euro  increased tio sales in by a net million compared to fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies similarly impacted kronos foreign currency denominated operating expenses 
nl s operating costs that are not denominated in the us dollar  when translated into us dollars  were higher in compared to the same periods of overall  currency exchange rate fluctuations resulted in a net decrease in kronos operating income in of approximately million as compared to year ended december  compared to year ended december  the company s sales increased million in compared to due primarily to higher tio sales volumes  offset by lower average tio selling prices 
the company s record tio sales volumes in were higher compared to primarily due to higher volumes in european and north american markets of and  respectively 
by volume  approximately one half of the company s tio sales volumes were attributable to markets in europe  with attributable to north america and the balance to export markets 
the lower tio sales volumes in were due in part to the effect of a fire at the company s leverkusen  germany facility in march that disrupted operations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
excluding the effect of fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies  the company s average tio selling price in was lower than  with prices lower in all major regions 
when translated from billing currencies to us dollars using actual foreign currency exchange rates prevailing during the respective periods  the company s average tio selling prices in decreased compared to the company s cost of sales increased million in compared to due to higher sales volume  partially offset by lower unit costs  which resulted primarily from the higher production levels 
the effects of lower tio sales and production volumes in were partially offset by receipt of the business interruption proceeds discussed above 
the company s cost of sales  as a percentage of net sales  increased from in to in primarily due to the impact on net sales of the lower average selling prices partially offset by lower unit costs 
the company s gross margin declined million in compared to as the effect of lower average tio selling prices more than offset the effect of higher tio sales and production volumes 
the effect of the higher sales and production volumes was offset in part by the million of business interruption proceeds received in  as discussed below 
the company s record tio production volume in was higher than kronos operating rates in were lower as compared to primarily due to lost production resulting from the leverkusen fire 
the company s income from operations in includes million of business interruption insurance proceeds as payment for losses unallocated period costs and lost margin caused by the leverkusen fire 
the effects of the lower tio sales and production volumes were offset in part by the business interruption insurance proceeds 
of such million of business interruption insurance proceeds  million was recorded as a reduction of cost of sales to offset unallocated period costs that resulted from lost production  and the remaining million  representing recovery of lost margin  is included in income from operations as shown on the table above 
the business interruption insurance proceeds distorted the income from operations margin percentage in as there are no sales associated with the million of lost margin recognized 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company also recognized insurance recoveries of million in for property damage and related cleanup and other extra expenses related to the leverkusen fire  resulting in an insurance gain of million  as the insurance recoveries exceeded the carrying value of the property destroyed and the cleanup and other extra expenses incurred 
such insurance gain is not reported as a component of income from operations but is included in other income and expense  as discussed below 
the company does not expect to recognize any additional insurance recoveries related to the leverkusen fire 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company s selling  general and administrative expenses sg a expenses increased million in as compared to primarily due to higher distribution expenses  associated with the higher sales volume in and higher administrative expenses of million  as well as the impact of relative changes in foreign currency exchange rates  which increased kronos expenses in compared to sg a expenses were approximately of sales in both and as discussed above  kronos has substantial operations and assets located outside the united states primarily in germany  belgium  norway and canada and consequently  the translated us dollar value of kronos foreign sales and operating results are subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations that may favorably or adversely impact reported earnings and may affect the comparability of period to period operating results 
overall  fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies  primarily the euro  increased tio sales in by a net million compared to fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies similarly impacted kronos foreign currency denominated operating expenses 
nl s operating costs that are not denominated in the us dollar  when translated into us dollars  were higher in compared to the same periods of overall  currency exchange rate fluctuations on kronos operating income comparisons was not significant in as compared to outlook kronos expects its tio production volumes in will approximate its production volumes  and sales volumes are expected to be slightly higher in as compared to kronos average ti selling price  which declined during the second half of  is expected to continue to decline during the first quarter of kronos is hopeful that its average selling prices will cease to decline sometime during the first half of and will rise thereafter 
nevertheless  kronos expects its average tio selling prices  in billing currencies  will be lower in as compared to overall  kronos expects its operating income in will be lower than kronos expectations as to the future prospects of kronos and the tio industry are based upon a number of factors beyond its control  including worldwide growth of gross domestic product  competition in the marketplace  unexpected or earlier than expected capacity additions and technological advances 
if actual developments differ from kronos expectations  the company s results of operations could be unfavorably affected 
other income expense the following table sets forth certain information regarding other income and expense items

other interest and dividend income securities gains losses  net 
interest expense interest income  including noncash interest income on restricted cash balances and restricted marketable debt securities  fluctuates in part based upon the amount of funds invested and yields thereon 
aggregate interest and dividend income declined million in compared to and million in compared with primarily due to lower average yields on invested funds 
average funds invested in were higher compared with the subsequent years primarily due to the decrease in the balance of restricted cash and marketable debt securities over the past three years as such funds were used to pay for certain environmental remediation expenditures of the company 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company expects interest income will be lower in than due to lower average yields and lower average levels of funds available for investment 
securities gains losses  net in included a million noncash securities gain related to the exchange of the company s holdings of tremont corporation common stock for shares of valhi  inc common stock as a result of a series of merger transactions completed in february see note to the consolidated financial statements

as a result of the refinancing  the company recognized a foreign currency transaction gain of million in related to the extinguishment of certain intercompany indebtedness 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the insurance recoveries  net of million in related to insurance proceeds received from property damage resulting from the leverkusen fire 
the insurance proceeds received exceeded the carrying value of the property destroyed and cleanup costs incurred 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
interest expense in increased million compared to primarily due to higher levels of outstanding debt and associated currency effects  partially offset by lower interest rates 
interest expense in increased million compared with primarily due to million of additional second quarter interest expense related to the early extinguishment of the company s senior secured notes 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
assuming no significant change in interest rates  interest expense in is expected to be higher compared with due to higher average levels of outstanding indebtedness  partially offset by lower average interest rates 
provision for income taxes 
the principal reasons for the difference between the company s effective income tax rates and the us federal statutory income tax rates are explained in note to the consolidated financial statements 
income tax rates vary by jurisdiction country and or state  and relative changes in the geographic mix of the company s pre tax earnings can result in fluctuations in the effective income tax rate 
during  nl reduced its deferred income tax asset valuation allowance by approximately million  primarily as a result of utilization of certain income tax attributes for which the benefit had not previously been recognized 
in addition  the company recognized a million income tax benefit related to the net refund of certain prior year german income taxes 
during  nl reduced its deferred income tax asset valuation allowance by approximately million  primarily as a result of utilization of certain income tax attributes for which the benefit had not previously been recognized 
the provision for income taxes in also includes a million deferred income tax benefit related to certain changes in the belgian tax law 
during  nl reduced its deferred income tax asset valuation allowance by million 
of such reduction  million related to a change in estimate of nl s ability to utilize certain german income tax attributes following the completion of a restructuring of its german operations  the benefit of which had not previously been recognized under the more likely than not recognition criteria 
in addition  nl also utilized certain tax attributes during for which the benefit had also not previously been recognized 
at december   the company had the equivalent of approximately million of german income tax loss carryforwards with no expiration date 
however  nl has provided a deferred tax valuation allowance against substantially all of these income tax loss carryforwards because nl currently believes they do not meet the more likely than not recognition criteria 
the company periodically evaluates the more likely than not recognition criteria with respect to such tax loss carryforwards  and it is possible that in the future the company may conclude such carryforwards do meet the recognition criteria  at which time the company would reverse all or a portion of such deferred tax valuation allowance 
in january  the german federal government enacted new tax law amendments that limit the annual utilization of income tax loss carryforward effective january  the new law may significantly affect kronos future income tax expense and cash tax payments 
minority interest 
the company commenced recognizing minority interest in kronos following the company s december distribution of a portion of the shares of kronos common stock to its stockholders 
because of such distribution  the company expects to report a higher amount of minority interest in earnings in as compared to see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
minority interest in nl s subsidiaries also relates to nl s majority owned environmental management subsidiary  nl environmental management services  inc ems 
ems was established in  at which time ems contractually assumed certain of nl s environmental liabilities 
ems earnings are based  in part  upon its ability to favorably resolve these liabilities on an aggregate basis 
the stockholders of ems  other than nl  actively manage the environmental liabilities and share in of ems cumulative earnings 
nl continues to consolidate ems and provides accruals for the reasonably estimable costs for the settlement of ems environmental liabilities  as discussed below 
related party transactions 
the company is a party to certain transactions with related parties 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
accounting principles newly adopted in see note to the consolidated financial statements 
accounting principles not yet adopted 
see note to the consolidated financial statements assumptions on defined benefit pension plans and opeb plans defined benefit pension plans 
the company maintains various defined benefit pension plans in the us  europe and canada 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company accounts for its defined benefit pension plans using sfas no 
 employer s accounting for pensions 
under sfas no 
 defined benefit pension plan expense and prepaid and accrued pension costs are each recognized based on certain actuarial assumptions  principally the assumed discount rate  the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets and the assumed increase in future compensation levels 
the company recognized consolidated defined benefit pension plan expense of million in  million in and million in the amount of funding requirements for these defined benefit pension plans is generally based upon applicable regulations such as erisa in the us  and will generally differ from pension expense recognized under sfas no 
for financial reporting purposes 
contributions made by nl to all of its plans aggregated million in  million in and million in the discount rates the company utilizes for determining defined benefit pension expense and the related pension obligations are based on current interest rates earned on long term bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by recognized rating agencies in the applicable country where the defined benefit pension benefits are being paid 
in addition  the company receives advice about appropriate discount rates from the company s third party actuaries  who may in some cases utilize their own market indices 
the discount rates are adjusted as of each valuation date september th to reflect then current interest rates on such long term bonds 
such discount rates are used to determine the actuarial present value of the pension obligations as of december st of that year  and such discount rates are also used to determine the interest component of defined benefit pension expense for the following year 
at december   approximately   and of the projected benefit obligation related to nl plans in the us  germany  canada and norway  respectively 
the company uses several different discount rate assumptions in determining its consolidated defined benefit pension plan obligations and expense because the company maintains defined benefit pension plans in several different countries in north america and europe and the interest rate environment differs from country to country 
the company used the following discount rates for its defined benefit pension plans discount rates used for obligations at obligations at obligations at december  and expense december  and expense december  and in in expense in us germany canada norway the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets represents the estimated average rate of earnings expected to be earned on the funds invested or to be invested in the plans assets provided to fund the benefit payments inherent in the projected benefit obligations 
unlike the discount rate  which is adjusted each year based on changes in current long term interest rates  the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets will not necessarily change based upon the actual  short term performance of the plan assets in any given year 
defined benefit pension expense each year is based upon the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets for each plan and the actual fair value of the plan assets as of the beginning of the year 
differences between the expected return on plan assets for a given year and the actual return are deferred and amortized over future periods based either upon the expected average remaining service life of the active plan participants for plans for which benefits are still being earned by active employees or the average remaining life expectancy of the inactive participants for plans for which benefits are not still being earned by active employees 
at december   approximately   and of the plan assets related to plan assets for nl s plans in the us  germany  canada and norway  respectively 
the company uses several different long term rates of return on plan asset assumptions in determining its consolidated defined benefit pension plan expense because the company maintains defined benefit pension plans in several different countries in north america and europe  the plan assets in different countries are invested in a different mix of investments and the long term rates of return for different investments differ from country to country 
in determining the expected long term rate of return on plan asset assumptions  the company considers the long term asset mix eg equity vs 
fixed income for the assets for each of its plans and the expected long term rates of return for such asset components 
in addition  the company receives advice about appropriate long term rates of return from the company s third party actuaries 
such assumed asset mixes are summarized below o during  the company s plan assets in the us are invested in the combined master retirement trust cmrt  a collective investment trust established by valhi to permit the collective investment by certain master trusts which fund certain employee benefits plans sponsored by contran and certain of its affiliates 
harold simmons is the sole trustee of the cmrt 
the cmrt s long term investment objective is to provide a rate of return exceeding a composite of broad market equity and fixed income indices including the s p and certain russell indices utilizing both third party investment managers as well as investments directed by mr 
simmons 
during the year history of the cmrt  through december   the average annual rate of return has been 
prior to  the company s us plan assets were invested with a combination and equity and fixed income managers 
o in germany  the composition of nl s plan assets is established to satisfy the requirements of the german insurance commissioner 
the current plan asset allocation at december  was to equity managers and to fixed income managers 
o in canada  nl currently has a plan asset target allocation of to equity managers and to fixed income managers  with an expected long term rate of return for such investments to average approximately basis points above the applicable equity or fixed income index 
the current plan asset allocation at december  was to equity managers and to fixed income managers 
o in norway  nl currently has a plan asset target allocation of to equity managers and to fixed income managers  with an expected long term rate of return for such investments of approximately and  respectively 
the current plan asset allocation at december  was to equity managers and to fixed income managers 
the company regularly reviews its actual asset allocation for each of its plans  and will periodically rebalance the investments in each plan to more accurately reflect the targeted allocation when considered appropriate 
the company s assumed long term rates of return on plan assets for  and were as follows us germany canada norway the company currently expects to utilize the same long term rate of return on plan asset assumptions in as it used in for purposes of determining the defined benefit pension plan expense 
to the extent that a plan s particular pension benefit formula calculates the pension benefit in whole or in part based upon future compensation levels  the projected benefit obligations and the pension expense will be based in part upon expected increases in future compensation levels 
for all of the company s plans for which the benefit formula is so calculated  the company generally bases the assumed expected increase in future compensation levels upon average long term inflation rates for the applicable country 
in addition to the actuarial assumptions discussed above  because nl maintains defined benefit pension plans outside the us  the amount of recognized defined benefit pension expense and the amount of prepaid and accrued pension costs will vary based upon relative changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
based on the actuarial assumptions described above and nl s current expectation for what actual average foreign currency exchange rates will be during  nl expects its defined benefit pension expense will approximate million in in comparison  nl expects to be required to make approximately million of contributions to such plans during as noted above  defined benefit pension expense and the amount recognized as prepaid and accrued pension costs are based upon the actuarial assumptions discussed above 
the company believes all of the actuarial assumptions used are reasonable and appropriate 
if nl had lowered the assumed discount rate by basis points for all of its plans as of december   nl s aggregate projected benefit obligations would have increased by approximately million at that date  and nl s defined benefit pension expense would be expected to increase by approximately million during similarly  if nl lowered the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets by basis points for all of its plans  nl s defined benefit pension expense would be expected to increase by approximately  during opeb plans 
certain subsidiaries of the company in the us and canada currently provide certain health care and life insurance benefits for eligible retired employees 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company accounts for such opeb costs under sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
under sfas no 
 opeb expense and accrued opeb costs are based on certain actuarial assumptions  principally the assumed discount rate and the assumed rate of increases in future health care costs 
the company recognized consolidated opeb expense income of  in   in and  in similar to defined benefit pension benefits  the amount of funding will differ from the expense recognized for financial reporting purposes  and contributions to the plans to cover benefit payments aggregated 
million in  million in and million in the assumed discount rates the company utilizes for determining opeb expense and the related accrued opeb obligations are generally based on the same discount rates the company utilizes for its us and canadian defined benefit pension plans 
in estimating the health care cost trend rate  the company considers its actual health care cost experience  future benefit structures  industry trends and advice from its third party actuaries 
during each of the past three years  the company has assumed that the relative increase in health care costs will generally trend downward over the next several years  reflecting  among other things  assumed increases in efficiency in the health care system and industry wide cost containment initiatives 
for example  at december   the expected rate of increase in future health care costs ranges from in  declining to in and thereafter 
based on the actuarial assumptions described above and nl s current expectation for what actual average foreign currency exchange rates will be during  the company expects its consolidated opeb expense will approximate million in in comparison  the company expects the employer contribution portion of costs to approximate million during as noted above  opeb expense and the amount recognized as accrued opeb costs are based upon the actuarial assumptions discussed above 
the company believes all of the actuarial assumptions used are reasonable and appropriate 
if the company had lowered the assumed discount rate by basis points for all of its opeb plans as of december   the company s aggregate projected benefit obligations would have increased by approximately  at that date  and the company s opeb expense would be expected to increase by less than  during similarly  if the assumed future health care cost trend rate had been increased by basis points  the company s accumulated opeb obligations would have increased by approximately million at december   and opeb expense would have increased by  in foreign operations nl has substantial operations located outside the united states principally europe and canada for which the functional currency is not the us dollar 
as a result  the reported amount of nl s assets and liabilities related to its non us operations  and therefore the company s consolidated net assets  will fluctuate based upon changes in currency exchange rates 
as of january   the functional currency of nl s german  belgian  dutch and french operations had been converted to the euro from their respective national currencies 
at december   nl had substantial net assets denominated in the euro  canadian dollar  norwegian kroner and united kingdom pound sterling 
liquidity and capital resources consolidated cash flows the company s consolidated cash flows for each of the past three years are presented below years ended december  in millions operating activities investing activities financing activities net cash provided used by operating  investing and financing activities operating activities 
certain items included in the determination of net income do not represent current inflows or outflows of cash 
for example  insurance recoveries  net of million in  are excluded from the determination of operating cash flow 
these insurance proceeds are shown in the statement of cash flows under investing activities to partially offset the cash outflow impact of capital expenditures related to the leverkusen sulfate plant reconstruction 
certain other items included in the determination of net income have an impact on cash flows from operating activities  but the impact of such items on cash will differ from their impact on net income 
for example  the amount of income or expense recorded for pension and opeb assets and obligations which depend upon a number of factors  including actuarial assumptions used to value obligations will generally differ from the outflows of cash for such benefits 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the tio industry is cyclical and changes in economic conditions within the industry significantly impact the earnings and operating cash flows of the company 
cash flow from operations is considered the primary source of liquidity for the company

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general 
the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and equity security prices 
in the past  the company has periodically entered into interest rate swaps or other types of contracts in order to manage a portion of its interest rate market risk 
otherwise  the company does not generally enter into forward or option contracts to manage such market risks  nor does the company enter into any such contract or other type of derivative instrument for trading or speculative purposes 
other than as described below  the company was not a party to any material forward or derivative option contract related to foreign exchange rates  interest rates or equity security prices at december  and see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
interest rates 
the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates  primarily related to indebtedness 
at december   all of the company s aggregate indebtedness was comprised of fixed rate instruments of fixed rate instruments and of variable rate borrowings 
the large percentage of fixed rate debt instruments minimizes earnings volatility which would result from changes in interest rates 
the following table presents principal amounts and weighted average interest rates for the company s aggregate outstanding indebtedness at december  at december  and  all outstanding fixed rate indebtedness was denominated in us dollars or the euro  and the outstanding variable rate borrowings were denominated in us dollars  the euro or the norwegian kroner 
information shown below for such foreign currency denominated indebtedness is presented in its us dollar equivalent at december  using exchange rates of us dollars per euro 
certain norwegian kroner denominated capital leases totaling  in have been excluded from the table below 
amount carrying fair interest maturity indebtedness value value rate date in millions fixed rate indebtedness euro denominated kii senior secured notes at december   fixed rate indebtedness aggregated million fair value million with a weighted average interest rate of  and variable rate indebtedness at such date aggregated million  which approximates fair value  with a weighted average interest rate of 
all of such fixed rate indebtedness was denominated in euros 
such variable rate indebtedness was denominated in the euro of the total or the norwegian kroner 
foreign currency exchange rates 
the company is exposed to market risk arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of manufacturing and selling its products worldwide 
earnings are primarily affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to the euro  the canadian dollar  the norwegian kroner and the united kingdom pound sterling 
as described above  at december   nl had the equivalent of million of outstanding euro denominated indebtedness the equivalent of million of euro denominated indebtedness and million of norwegian kroner denominated indebtedness 
the potential increase in the us dollar equivalent of the principal amount outstanding resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in exchange rates at such date would be approximately million at december  million 
at december   the company had entered into a short term currency forward contract maturing on january  to exchange an aggregate of euro million into us dollars at an exchange rate of us per euro 
such contract was entered into in conjunction with the january payment of an intercompany dividend from one of the company s european subsidiaries 
at december   the actual exchange rate was us per euro 
the estimated fair value of such foreign currency forward contract was not material at december  marketable equity and debt security prices 
the company is exposed to market risk due to changes in prices of the marketable securities  which are owned 
the fair value of such debt and equity securities at december  and was million and million  respectively 
the potential change in the aggregate fair value of these investments  assuming a change in prices  would be million at december  and million at december  the fair value of restricted marketable debt securities at december  and was million and million  respectively 
the potential change in the aggregate fair value of these investments assuming a change in prices would be million and million  respectively 
other 
the company believes there may be a certain amount of incompleteness in the sensitivity analyses presented above 
for example  the hypothetical effect of changes in interest rates discussed above ignores the potential effect on other variables which affect the company s results of operations and cash flows  such as demand for the company s products  sales volumes and selling prices and operating expenses 
contrary to the above assumptions  changes in interest rates rarely result in simultaneous parallel shifts along the yield curve 
accordingly  the amounts presented above are not necessarily an accurate reflection of the potential losses the company would incur assuming the hypothetical changes in market prices were actually to occur 
the above discussion and estimated sensitivity analysis amounts include forward looking statements of market risk which assume hypothetical changes in market prices 
actual future market conditions will likely differ materially from such assumptions 
accordingly  such forward looking statements should not be considered to be projections by the company of future events  gains or losses 
non gaap financial measures 
in an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding the company s results as determined by gaap  kronos has disclosed certain non gaap information which the company believes provides useful information to investors 
as discussed above  the company discloses percentage changes in its average tio prices in billing currencies  which excludes the effects of foreign currency translation 
such disclosure of the percentage change in kronos average tio selling price in billing currencies is considered a non gaap financial measure under regulations of the sec 
the disclosure of the percentage change in the company s average tio selling prices using actual foreign currency exchange rates prevailing during the respective periods is considered the most directly comparable gaap measure 
the company discloses percentage changes in its average tio prices in billing currencies because the company believes such disclosure provides useful information to investors to allow them to analyze such changes without the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  thereby facilitating period to period comparisons of the relative changes in average selling prices in the actual various billing currencies 
generally  when the us dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies  the percentage change in average selling prices in billing currencies will be higher or lower  respectively  than such percentage changes that would be used actual exchange rates prevailing during the respective periods
