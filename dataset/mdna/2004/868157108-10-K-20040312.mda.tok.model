executive summary we are a leading provider of specialized oilfield services and equipment focused on serving the production related needs of oil and gas companies primarily operating in the gulf of mexico 
we operate our businesses through four segments well intervention  marine  rental tools and other oilfield services 
although most of our revenue is derived from enhancing production from existing wells  a significant portion of our revenue from our rental tool businesses are derived from drilling related activity 
we operate in highly competitive markets where revenue and earnings are driven by competitive pricing  changes in the level of customer spending on drilling and production related projects  general economic conditions and governmental regulations 
most of our work is on a call out basis  meaning projects are secured within days before commencing  and completed within a month 
as a result  predicting revenue and earnings is difficult because backlog  or guaranteed future work  is not typical for the products and services we offer in the markets we compete 
we believe the key differentiating factors in our industry are product and service quality  project management and coordination  availability and reliability of assets and personnel  health  safety and environmental standards  and price 
key business drivers include the gulf of mexico drilling rig count  oil and natural gas production levels  current and expected future energy prices  particularly natural gas prices  and customers capital spending allocated for gulf of mexico drilling and production 
in  we experienced revenue growth in three of our four business segments as compared to revenue was a record million and net income was million  or per share 
despite our record revenue  our core gulf of mexico market area experienced only a modest upturn in activity in over although production related activity slightly increased  the average number of drilling rigs working offshore in the gulf of mexico was in  down from an average of rigs in  further indicating that overall demand for oilfield services did not meaningfully recover during the year 
energy producers continue to deploy the cash flows they reaped from high commodity prices to strengthen their balance sheets and improve their returns on capital 
although energy producers have historically reinvested the vast majority of their cash flows in further exploration and production opportunities  they now seem to be cutting back on these expenditures 
they also seem to be reinvesting more of their cash flows into international opportunities rather than in the gulf of mexico market area 
we believe the shallow water gulf of mexico still has economically viable prospects  and much is being done to stimulate additional exploration and production  such as royalty relief for deep drilling on the us continental shelf 
we believe the gulf of mexico will see activity levels increase on a long term basis as properties change owners from major integrated producers to independents  and as producers drill several deep water prospects 
however  while activity levels remain relatively low  we have implemented two strategies to increase the utilization of our assets and enhance our earnings potential 
one of the strategies to enhance our financial performance is to acquire  manage and decommission mature properties in the shallow waters of the gulf of mexico 
our main objective in this new venture is to provide additional opportunities for our other well intervention services  as well as our platform management businesses 
we will use our production related services to enhance production and  at the end of a property s economic life  use our assets to plug wells and decommission properties 
we will acquire older  more mature properties since they need many of the production enhancement services we provide 
by owning the properties  we can choose when we perform much of the work  helping to increase the utilization of our assets and services during seasonal downtime 
we made our first acquisition of oil and gas properties in december and intend to acquire other mature properties 
our second strategy is to grow our international business 
we intend to accomplish this by seeking international expansion opportunities through both internal growth and possible strategic acquisitions 
we have identified other markets that are similar to the gulf of mexico with many production enhancement opportunities 
those markets include mexico  the middle east  west africa and the north sea  in addition to our locations in australia  eastern canada  trinidad and venezuela 
in august  we increased our international business by acquiring premier oilfield services  a provider of rental tools based in aberdeen  scotland 
premier oilfield services has operations in various rental markets such as the north sea  continental europe  the middle east and west africa and will serve as a gateway to provide our other rental tools and production related services to these markets 
we are also focusing on additional expansion within mexico  venezuela and trinidad since we believe they offer the best opportunity to deploy most of our assets including liftboats  production related services and rental tools 
these markets are close to our core gulf of mexico market and are forecasted to have significant customer spending 
the discussion below gives a description of some of the drivers affecting the performance of each segment and highlights some of the main factors that impacted our performance in for additional industry segment financial information  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
well intervention segment the well intervention segment consists of specialized down hole services  which are both labor and equipment intensive 
while our gross margin percentage tends to be fairly consistent  special projects such as well control can directly increase the gross margin percentage 
during  we expanded our well intervention segment by forming a new subsidiary  spn resources  llc  to acquire  manage and decommission mature properties in the shallow waters of the gulf of mexico 
as previously mentioned  the main objective of this new venture is to provide additional opportunities for our other well intervention services  as well as our platform management businesses 
we intend to increase the utilization of our well intervention services by deploying these services to our own properties during periods of downtime 
since our first acquisition did not occur until december  this expansion did not have a material financial impact on our operating results 
marine segment liftboats have relatively high operating leverage  meaning that costs are fairly fixed and  therefore  gross margins can change significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year based on dayrates and utilization levels 
in  it was difficult for us to maintain steady liftboat utilization due to fluctuating customer demand and multiple weather disruptions in the gulf of mexico 
the average utilization of our liftboat fleet did not exceed for any quarter 
also  as the result of a tropical storm  one of our foot class liftboats sank in the gulf of mexico on june  the vessel was declared a total loss  and we received million of insurance proceeds for the vessel 
we recorded a gain from the insurance proceeds of million 
rental tools segment over time  our rental tools segment has shown consistent gross margin percentages despite changing levels of industry demand 
this has occurred because many of their costs of services vary directly with revenue 
in addition  there tends to be little variation in pricing 
as a result  changes in revenue are primarily a function of utilization 
the rental of drill pipe in the deep water gulf of mexico is another factor driving the steady performance of this segment 
drilling related projects in the deep water gulf of mexico market area typically last longer and are less impacted by changes in commodity prices and other factors impacting drilling activity in the shallow water gulf of mexico 
despite a small decline in the gulf of mexico rig count  our rental tools revenue increased in this segment continued to expand internationally  primarily in eastern canada and trinidad 
the acquisition of premier oilfield services  in aberdeen  scotland is serving to expand our rental tool operations in the north sea  continental europe  the middle east and west africa 
other oilfield services segment demand for our dockside vessel and tank cleaning and non hazardous waste treatment businesses are primarily driven by drilling activity in the shallow water gulf of mexico  as reflected by the drilling rig count 
much of the cleaning and waste treatment is from residual waste created during the drilling process 
our platform and field management businesses are highly competitive and labor intensive resulting in relatively low gross margins 
historically  the field management business has contributed the largest percentage of revenue to this segment  yielding gross margin percentages that have been lower than our other segments 
the other oilfield services segment benefited from sales of oil spill containment equipment early in as a result of a large oil spill off the coast of spain 
however  the decline in drilling in the gulf of mexico negatively impacted our environmental services  especially our non hazardous oilfield waste treatment business 
in august  we sold our construction and fabrication assets 
while this sale has greatly reduced this segment s revenue  it has not had a material impact on the segment s earnings because  historically  it was a business with low gross margins 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note to our consolidated financial statements contains a description of the accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements 
we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis  including those related to long lived assets and goodwill  income taxes  allowance for doubtful accounts  self insurance and oil and gas properties 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual amounts could differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies are most important to the presentation of our financial statements and require the most difficult  subjective and complex judgments 
long lived assets 
we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any such asset may not be recoverable 
we record impairment losses on long lived assets  including oil and gas properties  used in operations when the estimated cash flows to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those items 
our cash flow estimates are based upon  among other things  historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market rates  utilization levels  operating performance  future oil and natural gas sales prices  an estimate of the ultimate amount of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves that will be produced from a field  the timing of this future production  future costs to produce the oil and natural gas and other factors 
our estimates of cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to  among other things  changes in economic conditions or changes in an asset s operating performance 
if the sum of the cash flows is less than the carrying value  we recognize an impairment loss  measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset 
the net carrying value of assets not fully recoverable is reduced to fair value 
our estimate of fair value represents our best estimate based on industry trends and reference to market transactions and is subject to variability 
the oil and gas industry is cyclical and our estimates of the period over which future cash flows will be generated  as well as the predictability of these cash flows  can have significant impact on the carrying value of these assets and  in periods of prolonged down cycles  may result in impairment charges 
during the year ended december   we did not record any impairment losses related to long lived assets 
goodwill 
in assessing the recoverability of goodwill  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions adversely change in the future  we may be required to record material impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded 
we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
fas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective january  fas no 
requires that goodwill as well as other intangible assets with indefinite lives no longer be amortized  but instead tested annually for impairment 
we estimated the fair value of each of our reporting units which are consistent with our reportable segments using various cash flow and earnings projections 
we then compared these fair value estimates to the determined carrying value of our reporting units 
based on this test  the fair value of the reporting units exceeded the carrying amount  and no impairment loss has been recognized 
our estimates of the fair value of these reporting units represent our best estimates based on industry trends and reference to market transactions 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in performing these evaluations since the results are based on estimated future events 
income taxes 
we provide for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
fas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this standard takes into account the differences between financial statement treatment and tax treatment of certain transactions 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
our deferred tax calculation requires us to make certain estimates about our future operations 
changes in state  federal and foreign tax laws  as well as changes in our financial condition or the carrying value of existing assets and liabilities  could affect these estimates 
the effect of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
these estimated allowances are periodically reviewed  on a case by case basis  analyzing the customer s payment history and information regarding customer s creditworthiness known to us 
in addition  we record a reserve based on the size and age of all receivable balances against which we do not have specific reserves 
if the financial condition of our customers was to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
self insurance 
we self insure up to certain levels for losses related to workers compensation  protection and indemnity  general liability  property damage  and group medical 
with the recent tightening in the insurance markets  we have elected to retain more risk by increasing our self insurance 
we accrue for these liabilities based on estimates of the ultimate cost of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date 
we regularly review our estimates of reported and unreported claims and provide for losses through reserves 
while we believe these estimates are reasonable based on the information available  our financial results could be impacted if litigation trends  claims settlement patterns  health care costs and future inflation rates are different from our estimates 
although we believe adequate reserves have been provided for expected liabilities arising from our self insured obligations  and we believe that we maintain adequate excess insurance coverage  we cannot assure that such coverage will adequately protect us against liability from all potential consequences 
oil and gas properties 
our subsidiary  spn resources  llc  acquires mature oil and gas properties and assumes the related well abandonment and decommissioning liabilities 
we estimate the third party market value including an estimated profit to plug and abandon wells  abandon the pipelines  decommission and remove the platforms and clear the sites  and use that estimate to record our proportionate share of the decommissioning liability 
in estimating the decommissioning liabilities  we perform detailed estimating procedures  analysis and engineering studies 
whenever practical  we will utilize the services of our subsidiaries to perform well abandonment and decommissioning work 
when these services are performed by our subsidiaries  all recorded intercompany revenues and expenses are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements 
the recorded decommissioning liability associated with a specific property is fully extinguished when the property is completely abandoned 
the liability is first reduced by all cash expenses incurred to abandon and decommission the property 
if the liability exceeds or is less than our out of pocket costs then the difference is reported as income or loss in the period in which the work is performed 
we review the adequacy of our decommissioning liability whenever indicators suggest that the estimated cash flows underlying the liability have changed materially 
the timing and amounts of these cash flows are subject to changes in the energy industry environment and may result in additional liabilities recorded  which in turn would increase the carrying values of the related properties 
at december   the balance of our oil and gas properties was not significant at an estimated million 
comparison of the results of operations for the years ended december  and for the year ended december   our revenues were million resulting in net income of million or diluted earnings per share 
for the year ended december   our revenues were million and our net income was million or diluted earnings per share 
our increase in revenue and net income is the result of an overall increased demand for most of our services due to increased activity by our customers 
the following discussion analyzes our operating results on a segment basis 
well intervention segment revenue for our well intervention segment was million for the year ended december   as compared to million for this segment s gross margin percentage increased slightly to in the year ended december  from in the increase in revenue and gross margin percentage is the result of increased demand for almost all of our services as production related activity in the gulf of mexico increased 
our pumping and stimulation services benefited the most from the increased activity levels in the gulf of mexico while our hydraulic workover and well control services benefited from international activity 
marine segment our marine revenue for the year ended december  increased over to million 
the fleet s average dayrate increased to approximately  in the year ended december  from approximately  in  and the average utilization decreased to for from in the gross margin percentage for the year ended december  decreased to from in while revenues and the average dayrate increased because of additions of three larger liftboats to the fleet during  a drop off in utilization and the increased costs of the new liftboats resulted in a lower gross margin percentage 
increased costs  including maintenance and insurance  also contributed to the decline in gross margin percentage 
rental tools segment revenue for our rental tools segment for the year ended december  was million  a increase over the increase in this segment s revenue was primarily due to an increased demand for our expanded inventory of rental tool equipment and our geographic expansion 
during  revenue from international markets grew as we continue to diversify outside of the gulf of mexico market area 
we acquired premier oilfield services  an aberdeen  scotland based provider of oilfield equipment rentals  in august to further this diversification 
the gross margin percentage decreased slightly to in from in due primarily to a change in the mix of the demand for our rental tools 
other oilfield services segment other oilfield services revenue for the year ended december  was million  a decrease over the million in revenue in the gross margin percentage decreased slightly to in from in the lower revenue is attributable to a decrease in construction and fabrication revenue as the result of the sale of those assets in august  which was partially offset by increases in revenue from our field management services  growth in our oilfield waste treatment business and higher sales of oil spill containment equipment 
this segment s slightly lower gross margin percentage was due to additional costs associated with the sale of our construction and fabrication assets and the growth and expansion of our oilfield waste treatment business  which were partially offset by the increased sales of higher margin oil spill containment equipment 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization increased to million in the year ended december  from million in the increase resulted mostly from our larger asset base as a result of our capital expenditures during and general and administrative general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million in the increase is primarily the result of our internal growth and the acquisition of premier oilfield services 
however  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue remained relatively unchanged at approximately for both periods 
comparison of the results of operations for the years ended december  and for the year ended december   our revenues were million resulting in net income of million or diluted earnings per share  as compared to revenue of million and income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of million or diluted earnings per share for the decrease in revenue and operating income is a result of reduced activity by our customers  resulting in lower utilization of the company s expanded asset base 
in  we significantly expanded our capacity to serve our customers by adding three large liftboats  expanding our rental tool inventory  and expanding and enhancing several of our operating facilities 
the following discussion analyzes our operating results on a segment basis 
well intervention segment revenue for our well intervention segment was million for the year ended december   lower than the same period in this segment s gross margin decreased to in the year ended december  from in the year ended december  demand and pricing decreased for almost all of our services as production related activity decreased significantly 
marine segment our marine revenue for the year ended december  decreased over the same period in to million 
the gross margin percentage decreased to from as utilization for most liftboat classes declined in to from in we added two foot class liftboats and one foot class liftboat to our fleet during although these larger liftboats earn higher average dayrates  the fleet s average dayrate remained relatively unchanged from rental tools segment revenue for our rental tools segment for the year ended december  was million  a increase over the same period in  and the rental tools gross margin percentage increased to from in these increases resulted from our acquisition of a drill pipe and handling tool rental company near the end of the third quarter of and our larger asset base as a result of our acquisitions and capital expenditures during and other oilfield services segment other oilfield services revenue for the year ended december  was million  a increase over the same period in the gross margin increased slightly to million in the year ended december  from million in the same period in this segment generated higher revenue and gross margin primarily from the acquisition of an environmental services company in january depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization increased to million in the year ended december  from million in the increase mostly resulted from our larger asset base as a result of our acquisitions and capital expenditures during and as of january   we ceased amortizing our goodwill  while approximately million of goodwill amortization expense was recorded in the year ended december  general and administrative general and administrative expenses increased to million in the year ended december  from million in the increase is primarily the result of our and acquisitions 
liquidity and capital resources in the year ended december   we generated net cash from operating activities of million 
our primary liquidity needs are for working capital  capital expenditures  debt service and acquisitions 
our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
we had cash and cash equivalents of million at december  compared to million at december  we made million of capital expenditures during the year ended december   of which approximately million was used to expand and maintain our rental tool equipment inventory  approximately million was used on facilities construction including our facility in broussard  louisiana and approximately million was made in our marine segment 
we also made million of capital expenditures to expand and maintain the asset base of our well intervention group and other oilfield services group 
in august  we acquired premier oilfield services  an aberdeen  scotland based provider of oilfield equipment rentals  in order to geographically expand our operations and the rental tools segment 
we paid million in cash consideration for premier oilfield services  including transaction costs  and paid an additional million to repay its existing debt  concurrently with the acquisition 
we have outstanding million of senior notes due the indenture governing the senior notes requires semi annual interest payments  which commenced november  and continue through the maturity date of may  the indenture governing the senior notes contains certain covenants that  among other things  prevent us from incurring additional debt  paying dividends or making other distributions  unless our ratio of cash flow to interest expense is at least to  except that we may incur debt in addition to the senior notes in an amount equal to of our net tangible assets  which was approximately million at december  the indenture also contains covenants that restrict our ability to create certain liens  sell assets or enter into certain mergers or acquisitions 
we also have a bank credit facility  which was amended in august the amendment increased the balance of the term loans by million to finance the acquisition of premier oilfield services and extended the maturity date of the facility 
at december   we had term loans in an aggregate amount of million outstanding and a revolving credit facility of million  none of which was outstanding 
as of march   these balances were unchanged and the weighted average interest rate on amounts outstanding under the credit facility was per annum 
indebtedness under the credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets  including the pledge of the stock of our principal subsidiaries 
the credit facility contains customary events of default and requires that we satisfy various financial covenants 
it also limits our capital expenditures  our ability to pay dividends or make other distributions  make acquisitions  make changes to our capital structure  create liens or incur additional indebtedness 
we have million outstanding at december  in u 
s 
government guaranteed long term financing under title xi of the merchant marine act of  which is administered by the maritime administration marad for two foot class liftboats 
this debt bears an interest rate of per annum and is payable in equal semi annual installments of  which began december   and matures on june  our obligations are secured by mortgages on the two liftboats 
in accordance with the agreement  we are required to comply with certain covenants and restrictions  including the maintenance of minimum net worth and debt to equity requirements 
the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments at december  amounts in thousands for our long term debt and operating leases 
we do not have any other material obligations or commitments 
description thereafter long term debt       operating leases      total       we have no off balance sheet arrangements other than our guarantee of the lamb energy services credit facility consisting of a million term loan at december  and a million revolving credit facility   of which was outstanding as of december  and potential additional consideration that may be payable as a result of our acquisitions 
additional consideration is generally based on the acquired company s operating performance after the acquisition as measured by earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda and other adjustments intended to exclude extraordinary items 
while the amounts of additional consideration payable depend upon the acquired company s operating performance and are difficult to predict accurately  as of december   the maximum additional consideration payable for the company s remaining acquisitions will be approximately million  which will be determined in the second quarter of and payable during the second half of these amounts are not classified as liabilities under generally accepted accounting principles and are not reflected in our financial statements until the amounts are fixed and determinable 
we do not have any other financing arrangements that are not required under generally accepted accounting principles to be reflected in our financial statements 
when amounts are determined  they are capitalized as part of the purchase price of the related acquisition 
in the year ended december   we capitalized additional consideration of million related to five of our acquisitions  of which million was paid during and million is expected to be paid in the first half of we have identified capital expenditure projects that will require up to million in  exclusive of any acquisitions 
we believe that our current working capital  cash generated from our operations and availability under our revolving credit facility will provide sufficient funds for our identified capital projects 
we intend to continue implementing our growth strategy of increasing our scope of services through both internal growth and strategic acquisitions 
we expect to continue to make the capital expenditures required to implement our growth strategy in amounts consistent with the amount of cash generated from operating activities  the availability of additional financing and our credit facility 
depending on the size of any future acquisitions  we may require additional equity or debt financing in excess of our current working capital and amounts available under our revolving credit facility

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations and changes in interest rates 
a discussion of our market risk exposure in financial instruments follows 
foreign currency exchange rates because we operate in a number of countries throughout the world  we conduct a portion of our business in currencies other than the us dollar 
the functional currency for most of our international operations is the us dollar  but a portion of the revenues from our foreign operations is paid in foreign currencies 
the effects of foreign currency fluctuations are partly mitigated because local expenses of such foreign operations are also generally denominated in the same currency 
the company continually monitors the currency exchange risks associated with all contracts not denominated in the us dollar 
any gains or losses associated with such fluctuations have not been material 
we do not hold any foreign currency exchange forward contracts and or currency options 
we make limited use of derivative financial instruments to manage risks associated with existing or anticipated transactions 
we do not hold derivatives for trading purposes or use derivatives with leveraged or complex features 
derivative instruments are traded with creditworthy major financial institutions 
assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries are translated at current exchange rates  while income and expense are translated at average rates for the period 
translation gains and losses are reported as the foreign currency translation component of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity 
interest rates on occasion  we use interest rate swap agreements to manage our interest rate exposure 
under interest rate swap agreements  we agree with other parties to exchange  at specific intervals  the difference between fixed rate and variable rate interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed upon notional principal amount 
at december   we were party to an interest rate swap with an approximate notional amount of million designed to convert a similar amount of variable rate debt to fixed rates 
the interest rate was  and the swap matured in october at december   million of our long term debt had variable interest rates 
based on debt outstanding at december   a increase in variable interest rates would increase our interest expense in the year by approximately  while a decrease would decrease our interest expense by approximately
