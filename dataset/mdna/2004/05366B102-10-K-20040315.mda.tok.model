risk factors our dependence on the aerospace industry makes us susceptible to negative trends and adverse economic conditions in the aerospace industry 
virtually all of aviall services net sales and operating income are derived from the sale of parts  components  supplies and services to customers in the aerospace industry 
as a result  aviall services business is directly affected by trends and economic factors that affect flight activity in the aerospace industry  including fuel prices  economic cycles  inflation  labor instability and regulatory oversight  as well as other factors that affect flying activity by the us military and its allies 
reduced flight activity generally results in reduced demand for parts  components  supplies and services by customers in the aerospace industry 
because a high proportion of aviall services operating costs are relatively fixed  reduced sales have a negative impact on its earnings  as lower gross profits cannot be offset by lower expenses 
further  because we purchase parts  components and supplies from our suppliers in advance of orders from our customers based upon our estimates of future demand  the effect of reduced demand can have an even greater impact on our earnings 
if expected sales do not materialize  our inventory levels could increase  resulting in increased financing requirements and interest expense and reducing the credit available under the credit facility 
the demand for commercial air transport has been reduced by the prevailing global economic slowdown  terrorist attacks and their aftermath  and military activity in iraq 
this reduced flight activity  which has accelerated retirement of older aircraft and caused the deferral of nonessential aircraft maintenance and overhaul services  has reduced the demand for our parts  components and supplies used on commercial aircraft 
in addition  some air operations have been reduced because commercial airlines  air freight carriers and other commercial airline related firms around the world are experiencing large financial losses  which in some cases have resulted in bankruptcies 
we cannot predict the length of time required for a recovery of the global commercial aviation sector  and any recovery could be hindered by a number of factors  including slower economic growth  foreign political instability or acts of war or terrorism 
in recent periods  we have relied heavily on increased flight activity by the us military and foreign militaries  particularly with respect to aircraft fitted with the rr t series engine  to offset the decrease in commercial aviation activity 
the us military and certain foreign militaries may not sustain their current levels of flight activity and the demand for parts and components for military aircraft utilizing the rr t engine in particular may not continue to increase 
as a result  we may be unable to realize fully all of the benefits that we hope to receive from our rr t engine parts agreement with rolls royce 
moreover  if some or all of these militaries were to effect an extensive  protracted grounding of their fleets of hercules c aircraft  the primary aircraft on which rr t engines are fitted  our business would be severely disrupted 
under the terms of our agreement with rolls royce  we are required to purchase million of rr t engine parts from rolls royce in as of february   we have purchased million of rr t parts 
if demand for rr t engine parts decreases substantially  our inventory levels of rr t engine parts could grow to be larger than needed to support our sales  increasing our financing requirements and interest expense and reducing the credit available under the credit facility 

table of contents 
index to financial statements in addition  the demand for our parts  components and supplies could decrease if one or more of our customers were to eliminate or retire one or more of their aircraft fleet types 
further  the demand for our parts  components and supplies could decrease if intense competition in the aerospace industry or other factors cause one or more of our customers to go out of business 
any decreases in demand for our parts  components and supplies could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operation 
if our principal suppliers terminate or limit their relationships with us  our net sales could decline substantially and our business could otherwise be adversely affected 
we have several significant  long term agreements with rolls royce to sell its parts 
in addition  we have several long term agreements with honeywell to sell its parts  which are significant in the aggregate 
during  and of aviall services net sales were derived from sales of parts from rolls royce and honeywell  respectively 
we expect these agreements to continue to represent a substantial percentage of our future net sales 
while our agreements with honeywell and rolls royce are ten year agreements  each of these agreements contains a termination for convenience provision that allows the other party to terminate the agreement on the dates and subject to the advance notice provisions set forth below supplier parts earliest date for notice of termination for convenience notice requirement rolls royce rr t engine parts january  days rolls royce rr engine parts january  days honeywell hydromechanical controls for rr and honeywell lt series engines january  days honeywell honeywell esa and ecs april  days honeywell honeywell esa and ecs june  days honeywell hydromechanical controls for rr t engines june  days honeywell airline and general aviation lighting products october  days honeywell and rolls royce may also terminate these agreements if we materially breach or fail to make payments under these agreements  or if we become bankrupt or insolvent or commence bankruptcy proceedings 
furthermore  rolls royce may terminate our agreements to provide rr t engine parts and rr engine parts upon days prior written notice upon a change of control of rolls royce  if we are acquired by a competitor of rolls royce  or if we are acquired by a person that is not a competitor of rolls royce and the acquisition causes our credit rating to fall one notch below our credit rating prior to the acquisition 
in the event that rolls royce or honeywell discontinues production of the products we sell or terminates or fails to perform under our agreements with them  and we are otherwise unable to obtain the parts we need to fulfill our customers orders  our results of operations would likely be materially adversely affected 
our largest customers represent a large percentage of our total business and loss of all or some of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
in  aviall services ten largest customers represented  in the aggregate  approximately of its net sales  and rolls royce  its single largest customer  accounted for approximately of its net sales 
the sales to rolls royce relate primarily to its role as prime contractor for supplying rr t parts to the us military 
the loss of rolls royce or the loss of the business that we conduct through rolls royce with the us military would  and the loss of all or some of these other large customers could  have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 

table of contents 
index to financial statements competition in our industry is intense 
if we do not compete effectively  we could lose market share and our business could otherwise be negatively affected 
with respect to aviall services  the market for aerospace parts  components and supplies is extremely competitive  and we face competition from a number of sources 
aviall services competes with independent distributors  redistribution suppliers and aerospace oems who  in the aggregate  offer most of the same product lines to the same customers 
many of our existing and potential competitors have greater resources than us 
also  many of our agreements with our suppliers  including some  like those with honeywell  which in the aggregate are significant to our business  are non exclusive  and others  like those with rolls royce  permit the supplier to sell its products directly to our customers 
additionally  from time to time  we face competition from individual airlines liquidating or reducing their inventories  and in the future  we may face pricing pressures from airline consortiums pooling their resources to purchase parts  components and supplies at discounted prices 
numerous companies compete with ils in the operation of global aerospace and marine related electronic marketplaces 
our competitors in this area include airlines  manufacturers  distributors  independent companies  and their alliances  and we expect the competition in this area to increase in the future 
these competitive pressures could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
if we fail to accurately forecast our inventory requirements  we may incur significant costs or lose customers and our business could otherwise be adversely affected 
we use complex rolling forecasts based upon our anticipated product orders to determine what we purchase from our suppliers 
lead times for our product orders vary significantly and depend on factors such as specific supplier requirements  contract terms and the then current market demand for particular products 
if we underestimate our product requirements  we may have insufficient inventory to meet demand  which could result in shipping delays  lost sales and dissatisfied customers 
alternatively  if we overestimate our product requirements  we may accumulate excess inventory  which could result in increased carrying costs and write offs of inventory and related unamortized distribution rights 
in december  we wrote off million of parts used on older commercial aircraft 
because many of these aircraft were temporarily grounded or permanently retired in the aftermath of the september  terrorist attacks  we experienced reduced demand for replacement parts and components used on these aircraft 
we wrote off this excess inventory because of the likelihood that we would not be able to sell it in the future 
in addition  we may be required to write off inventory and related unamortized distribution rights when we stop selling a supplier s parts or components or when a supplier chooses to compete against us 
any future write offs could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
if our inventory does not meet specifications established by certain governmental agencies  we could incur significant costs and our operating performance could otherwise be negatively affected 
our inventory consists primarily of new aerospace parts  components and supplies that we purchase from our suppliers 
before any part  component or supply item may be used on an aircraft  it must meet standards of condition established by the faa  the us department of defense or the equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries  such as the canadian transport authority in canada  the joint aviation authority in the european union and the civil aviation authority in australia  new zealand  singapore and the united kingdom 
although regulatory requirements in other countries generally coincide with applicable us requirements  specific regulations may vary from country to country 
in some instances  components  parts and supplies that we purchase must also be traceable to sources deemed acceptable by the appropriate regulatory agency 

table of contents 
index to financial statements parts and components that we own or acquire may not meet applicable standards and are subject to changing standards  which could require us to modify or eliminate parts and components contained in our inventory 
aerospace parts manufacturers may also develop new parts and components to be used in lieu of parts and components already contained in our inventory 
in all such cases  to the extent that we have such parts and components in our inventory  their value may be reduced 
our significant indebtedness and other contractual obligations could adversely affect our financial health 
as of december   we had million of debt outstanding  including capital lease obligations 
we also had significant commitments under our parts contracts with rolls royce 
in  we have committed to purchase million of rr t parts and million of rr parts from rolls royce 
as of february   we had purchased million of rr t parts and million of rr parts 
we also have significant obligations under operating leases 
as of december   we had approximately million of floating rate borrowings outstanding  primarily for fixed rate borrowings that have been effectively converted to floating rate borrowings through an interest rate swap agreement 
in addition  the credit facility allowed for up to million of additional floating rate borrowings as of december  as a result  our floating rate borrowings could increase dramatically in the future 
future interest rate increases will increase our interest expense on our floating rate borrowings  which could be significant 
our leverage could have important consequences 
for example  it could make it difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations  including making scheduled principal and interest payments on the new notes and our other indebtedness  place us at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to fulfill contractual obligations and service payments on our indebtedness  thereby reducing funds available for other purposes  increase our vulnerability to a downturn in general economic conditions or the industry in which we compete  limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and general corporate and other purposes  and limit our ability to plan for and react to changes in our business and the industry in which we compete 
we and our subsidiaries will be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future under our credit facility and any securities issued under our shelf registration statement 
although the credit facility and the indenture governing the new notes will restrict us and our restricted subsidiaries from incurring additional debt  these restrictions are subject to important exceptions and qualifications 
if we or our subsidiaries incur additional debt  the risks that we and they now face as a result of our leverage could intensify 
our corporate headquarters  distribution network hub and over of the value of our inventory reside in the same building 
if we lose access to  or use of  this building  our business would be interrupted  which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
our corporate headquarters building near dfw airport is the hub for our distribution network 
over of the value of our inventory resides in this building  and we receive and ship the majority of our inventory from this location 
if we were unable to access this building because of security concerns  a natural disaster or otherwise or if this building were destroyed or materially damaged  our business would be materially adversely affected 
furthermore  any damage to the building could damage some or all of the inventory stored in the building 
if inventory is damaged  the faa could require us to inspect each item before sale  which could take a protracted amount of time and cause us to lose sales and customers 
any material loss of sales or customers would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

table of contents 
index to financial statements while we have a disaster recovery plan to manage the use of our information technology and deal with telecommunications interruptions and other disasters  this plan has not been tested in an appropriate environment 
in addition  we have business interruption insurance to both offset the cost of  and compensate us for  any event which interrupts our operations 
however  the coverage may not be sufficient to compensate us for all potential losses and the conditions to the coverage may preclude us from obtaining reimbursement for some potential losses 
while we have attempted to match our coverage to the most likely potential disasters and events that could interrupt our business  we may not have been able to foresee all the costs and implications of a disaster or other event and  therefore  the coverage may not be sufficient to reimburse us for our losses 
any material losses for which we are unable to obtain reimbursement may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
if our faa repair authority is revoked or limited  we could incur significant costs and our growth could be hindered 
in  aviall services product overhaul  repair and final assembly activities  which are regulated by the faa  represented approximately of aviall services net sales  including the parts used in these activities 
the faa prescribes standards and licensing requirements for aerospace components and effectively regulates component repair stations worldwide 
comparable agencies also regulate these matters in each of the foreign countries in which aviall services conducts operations 
if aviall services does not have required faa authority for its overhaul  repair and final assembly facilities  or loses the authority once it has been granted  the operation of that facility may be prohibited until it is able to obtain faa authority 
while we believe that aviall services possesses all required domestic and foreign governmental certifications  the revocation or limitation of its faa repair authority would have a material adverse effect on its overhaul  repair and final assembly operations 
in addition  we may be forced to incur unanticipated costs to adapt aviall services overhaul  repair and final assembly operations to any changes in faa regulations 
moreover  for purposes of their own compliance with faa requirements  some of our customers may require us to certify that our facilities  products and services meet certain standards and specifications 
if we fail to meet these certification requirements or fail to maintain our certified status with one or more of our customers  our reputation could be harmed  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we are subject to risks associated with our international operations  and we may fail to implement strategies that adequately protect us against these risks 
we sell our products to customers located in many countries around the world 
because we sell our products and services outside of the us  we are exposed to risks associated with selling and operating in foreign countries 
these risks include fluctuations in currency exchange rates  political instability  limitations on the conversion of foreign currencies into us dollars  and economic volatility 
during  we derived approximately of our total sales from selling our products and services to customers located outside of the us only of our total sales were denominated in foreign currencies 
the percentage of our net sales derived from selling our products and services outside of the us could increase in the future 
although we may enter into certain transactions to hedge the risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations or take other steps to protect against these risks  we may be unable to fully protect ourselves against these risks 
any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations

index to financial statements the interests of our principal stockholders may be inconsistent with the interests of our other equity holders 
as of march   affiliates of the carlyle group  a private equity firm  beneficially owned approximately of our common stock  and two managing directors of the carlyle group sit on our board of directors 
in addition  pursuant to an investor rights agreement between affiliates of the carlyle group and us  or the investor rights agreement  we may not take certain actions without their consent  including incurring certain types of additional debt  making specified payments and capital expenditures or issuing any class of capital stock that ranks senior to our common stock 
as such  the carlyle group asserts considerable influence over our operations 
the interests of the carlyle group and its affiliates may not be consistent with the interests of our other equity holders 
although the carlyle investors may dispose of up to  shares of common stock pursuant to two shelf registration statements  portions of the investor rights agreement will continue in effect for so long as the carlyle investors continue to beneficially own at least of our common stock 
the terms of our indebtedness and the investor rights agreement could restrict our operations 
the terms of our indebtedness  including the credit facility and the indenture governing the new senior notes  and the investor rights agreement  contain covenants restricting our ability to  among other things  modify our corporate governance documents  incur certain additional debt  make specified payments and capital expenditures  authorize or issue capital stock  enter into transactions with our affiliates  consolidate  merge with or acquire another business  sell certain of our assets or liquidate  dissolve or wind up our company 
in addition  the terms of the credit facility require us to achieve and maintain certain specified financial ratios 
these restrictions may limit our ability to engage in activities which could expand our business  including obtaining future financing  making needed capital expenditures  or taking advantage of business opportunities such as strategic acquisitions and dispositions 
our failure to comply with the covenants contained in the credit facility or the indenture governing the new senior notes could result in an event of default that could cause acceleration of our indebtedness 
our failure to comply with the covenants and other requirements contained in the indenture governing the new senior notes  the credit facility or our other debt instruments could cause an event of default under the relevant debt instrument 
the occurrence of an event of default could trigger a default under our other debt instruments  prohibit us from accessing additional borrowings  and permit the holders of the defaulted debt to declare amounts outstanding with respect to that debt to be immediately due and payable 
our assets or cash flow may not be sufficient to repay fully borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments  and we may be unable to refinance or restructure the payments on indebtedness on favorable terms  or at all 
an event of default under our credit facility or our new senior notes  particularly if followed by an acceleration of any outstanding amounts  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we could incur significant costs and expenses related to environmental problems 
various federal  state  local and foreign laws and regulations require property owners or operators to pay for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances located on or emanating from their property 
some of our current operations  such as our battery repair and brake service centers  use small quantities of hazardous or toxic substances in their operations 
some of our previously owned businesses used certain chemicals classified by various federal  state  local and foreign agencies as hazardous substances 
we retain certain environmental liabilities related to these businesses for the period prior to their sale 
we are involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup to comply with federal  state  local and foreign regulations related to these businesses 

table of contents 
index to financial statements these same laws and regulations also impose liability on persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances for the costs of their removal or remediation at the disposal or treatment facility 
these laws and regulations generally impose liability regardless of whether the entity arranging for disposal ever owned or operated the disposal facility 
we have been named a potentially responsible party under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act and the superfund amendments and reauthorization act at five third party disposal sites to which wastes were allegedly sent by the previous owner of assets used in our discontinued engine services operations 
we did not use these identified disposal sites 
accordingly  the previous owner has retained  and has been discharging  all liability associated with the cleanup of these sites pursuant to the sales agreement 
although we could be potentially liable in the event of nonperformance by the previous owner  we do not anticipate nonperformance 
in addition  we have two pending lawsuits related to previously owned businesses  which we believe to be immaterial 
as a past operator of businesses that used hazardous or toxic substances  we may be liable for additional removal or remediation costs  governmental penalties  property damage and related expenses 
these costs and expenses could be significant and have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
if we improperly ship hazardous materials  we could incur substantial fines or damages 
the faa exercises regulatory jurisdiction over and actively monitors the shipment of hazardous materials by air 
some of the products that we sell contain hazardous materials that are subject to these regulations  such as chemicals  oxygen generators  oxygen bottles and life rafts 
we share responsibility with the air carrier for compliance with faa regulations in shipping hazardous materials by air  and we are primarily responsible for the proper packaging and labeling of these items 
if we mislabel or otherwise improperly ship hazardous materials  we may be liable for damage to the aircraft and other property as well as substantial monetary penalties 
if any of these events were to occur  they could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operation 
our failure to comply with the numerous laws and government regulations that govern our business could result in us being liable for material fines  penalties or damages or could restrict our operations 
in addition to regulation by the faa  foreign civil aviation authorities and the us environmental protection agency  our operations are subject to numerous federal  state  local and foreign laws and government regulations 
while we endeavor to comply with all applicable laws and government regulation  our operations may from time to time fail to fully comply with some of these laws and government regulations 
any violation of these laws or government regulations could result in material fines  penalties or damages being imposed on us or could result in restrictions or limitations on how we conduct our operations 
any such fines  penalties or damages or limitations on our operations could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations

index to financial statements a significant failure of our computer systems or networks could increase our operating costs significantly  cause us to lose customers and otherwise adversely affect our business 
we depend upon our computer systems and networks to deliver our products and services  respond to the needs of our customers  sell and manage our inventory  perform accounting and administrative functions  provide product and other informational services and create ils s electronic marketplaces 
the success of our businesses depend upon our ability to provide superior reliability  capacity and security for both our internet based and dial up systems 
we are continually upgrading our computer networks and software 
our computer systems and networks  and the networks upon which we depend  are subject to factors that may cause interruptions in service or reduce capacity for our customers  including  but not limited to  physical damage  problems upgrading or integrating new hardware or software  power loss  capacity limitations  software defects and breaches of security due to computer viruses  break ins or otherwise 
significant interruptions in service  capacity limitations or security breaches could disrupt our relationships with our suppliers and customers  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we plan to upgrade our enterprise resources planning software during to our current supplier s latest version 
we plan to use internal resources  as well as the supplier and other outside software consultants  to implement the upgrade by the end of the third quarter of to mitigate the risks associated with the implementation  we have installed a full hardware and software test environment  separate from our operating environment  to thoroughly test and validate the upgrade 
while we have experience with the software and a detailed implementation plan  all software implementations of this complexity have inherent risks 
we believe our plan mitigates any potential major disruption to our business from implementing the upgrade 
advances in technology and evolving industry standards could increase our costs or cause us to lose customers 
the electronic marketplace business in which ils operates is characterized by evolving industry standards and changing customer requirements 
the introduction of new hardware or software or the emergence of new industry trends or standards could render our existing hardware  software or services obsolete  cause us to incur significant hardware  software  development or labor costs or cause us to write off prior investments in hardware or software 
for example  in the second quarter of  we incurred a million impairment loss resulting from the write off of a vendor software license purchased in we took this loss because we decided to pursue other cost effective alternatives after the vendor changed its strategic focus 
in addition  our failure to introduce new services and enhancements to our existing services in response to changing market conditions or customer or technology requirements could cause us to lose business to our competitors 
any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets in the future could be limited  negatively affecting our results of operations and cash flows 
at december   we had a million net deferred tax asset of which million relates to our us federal net operating loss  or nol  carryforwards 
this equates to a gross us federal nol of approximately million  substantially all of which expires in while we believe we will generate sufficient future us federal taxable income to utilize our us federal nol carryforwards before expiration  we also believe that we may not generate sufficient future taxable income in primarily state and foreign tax jurisdictions to utilize all of our state and foreign nol carryforwards before their expiration 

table of contents 
index to financial statements section of the internal revenue code  or section  imposes limitations on a corporation s ability to utilize us federal nols if it experiences an ownership change as defined in section  or an ownership change 
the amount of the annual limitation can vary significantly based on factors existing at the date of the ownership change 
the value of the corporation s stock immediately before an ownership change is one of the most influential factors affecting the annual limitation calculation 
if we had experienced an ownership change as of december   based on our year end closing stock price of per share  we believe the annual limitation imposed would not have impacted our ability to fully utilize our us federal nol 
an ownership change under section may occur under circumstances which would not be considered as a change of control as used in most circumstances 
the dividend resulting from reducing the conversion price of our series d redeemable preferred stock and the subsequent conversion into common stock did not result in an annual limitation on the amount of our us federal nol carryforward that we could utilize 
in addition  the future exercise of our outstanding warrants will not be deemed to be additional changes to our stock ownership  separate and apart from the original issuance of the warrants in march  nor will the sale of the carlyle investors stock under the recent shelf registration statement cause an ownership change 
a substantial decrease in stock price combined with an ownership change could affect our ability to fully utilize our us federal nol carryforward and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows 
we cannot determine the stock price or amount of ownership change which would result in a limitation of our us federal nol carryforward due to various factors including the timing of a future ownership change and the amount of us taxable earnings earned prior to the ownership change

in no event should variable working capital be considered as an alternative to working capital or any other gaap measure as an indicator of our performance  nor should variable working capital be considered as an alternative to working capital as an indicator of our relative liquidity to meet our obligations within an ordinary business cycle 
we believe that variable working capital is a useful measure  along with measurements under gaap  in evaluating our financial performance and our ability to leverage sales and earnings 
in addition  we use variable working capital as a financial measure to evaluate our management of working capital and as a metric to measure contract and supplier performance

index to financial statements item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview we are the largest independent global provider of new aerospace parts  supply chain management and other related value added services to the aerospace aftermarket 
through aviall services  we purchase new and oem remanufactured aerospace parts  components and supplies from over oems and resell them through our network of customer service centers located in north america  europe  asia  australia and new zealand 
in addition  through ils we operate an electronic marketplace for buying and selling parts  equipment and services for the aerospace  defense and marine industries 
we have grown from million in net sales in to  billion in net sales in operating income has similarly grown from million in to million in despite a very challenging aerospace industry environment  we have been able to successfully implement our strategic vision of improved customer service  deployment of industry leading supply chain technologies and comprehensive efficiencies and improvements in our selling and administrative infrastructure 
these capabilities resulted in the award of several significant long term agreements with rolls royce and a series of contracts with honeywell  which in the aggregate are significant 
the successful implementation of these contracts produced net sales amounting to over million in in addition  these contracts have diversified aviall services customer base as of to approximately of its net sales from government military  of its net sales from general aviation corporate sales and from commercial airline sales 
while these new long term supplier contracts  particularly the rr t  have led to a reduction in our gross margin as a percentage of net sales  the gross margin percentage decrease is more than offset by a much lower increase in our selling and administrative expense 
we specifically designed our infrastructure and operations to be highly scalable  in order to accommodate these significant increases in both product range and volume  while incurring minimal incremental selling and administrative expense 
since  we have experienced only an million  or  increase in selling and administrative expenses while more than doubling our net sales 
consequently  our reportable segment operating profit has risen over from million in to million in in the future  we will continue to focus on the acquisition of new long term supplier contracts  delivering superior customer service  expanding the supplier base and product offerings and investing in technology and infrastructure to increase supplier and customer efficiencies 
we will also continue to evaluate potential strategic acquisitions 
we believe our ability to grow at a pace similar to that which we experienced since will depend on the award of one or a series of new long term scalable contracts and or completion of a strategic acquisition 
the timing and length of the process to procure a new long term agreement or strategic acquisition is unpredictable 
we are pursuing a number of opportunities for additional growth 
in addition  the economies of scale derived from these recent contracts may not be indicative of our future results 
in  we also enhanced our capital structure by refinancing the notes and converting our series d redeemable preferred stock into common stock  enabling us to reduce our cost of capital 
as of december   we had million available under the credit facility 
our business model assumes that we will continue to pursue new long term supplier contracts and strategic acquisitions and  accordingly  we believe an appropriate level of liquidity is essential 
however  as discussed  the timing for new contracts or acquisitions is uncertain and will depend upon  among other factors  availability of contracts or acquisition candidates and market trends 
we expect net earnings from continuing operations in to be in the range of approximately million to million or equivalent to approximately to per diluted share based upon the current number of diluted shares 

table of contents 
index to financial statements description of income statement classifications net sales 
aviall services net sales are generated primarily from the sale of new and oem remanufactured aerospace parts  components and supplies 
we sell these products at prices based upon either a discount from the manufacturers published list prices or with a margin above our cost to buy the product 
ils s net sales consist mainly of monthly or yearly subscription fees to access ils s online databases  fees charged to firms listing inventory in the databases  communications fees  revenue from the sale of custom reports and decision support products and fees for developing and hosting customers catalogs 
ils is an information service provider and does not own or sell the parts  equipment or services listed in its databases 
cost of sales and gross profit 
aviall services cost of sales consists primarily of costs incurred to purchase parts and supplies from oems  inventory carrying costs such as shrinkage and excess and obsolescence  and the amortization of the licensing fees for our significant long term agreements with honeywell and rolls royce 
we purchase parts  components and supplies based on discounts from the manufacturers published list prices as specified in agreements with our suppliers 
because the product sold by ils is information  we include the expenses required to maintain and operate the central ils computer system and communications network in our cost of sales 
these expenses include the salaries and benefits of the computer operations staff  depreciation and lease costs for computer and communications equipment  telecommunications expenses and software costs 
gross profit is the difference between the sales generated and the costs related to those sales 
selling and administrative expenses 
selling and administrative expenses include all costs related to marketing  sales  planning and purchasing  accounting  finance  and other administrative departments of the two business units and the corporate staff 
in addition  aviall services selling and administrative expenses include costs related to operating its central warehouse and our worldwide customer service centers 
critical accounting policies the process of preparing financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires us to use estimates and assumptions to determine certain of our assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
we base these estimates and assumptions upon the best information available to us at the time the estimates or assumptions are made 
our estimates and assumptions could change materially as conditions both within and beyond our control change 
accordingly  our actual results could differ materially from our estimates 
the most significant estimates made by our management include our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  reserves for excess and obsolete inventories  deferred tax asset valuation allowances  pension and postretirement benefit obligations and valuation of distribution rights 
the following is a discussion of our critical accounting policies and the related management estimates and assumptions necessary in determining the value of related assets or liabilities 
a full description of all of our significant accounting policies is included in note summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 

table of contents 
index to financial statements allowance for doubtful accounts 
an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable is established based on our estimates of the amount of uncollectible accounts receivable on a customer by customer basis 
we determine the required allowance using information such as customer credit history  industry and market segment information  economic trends and conditions  credit reports and customer financial condition 
the estimates can be affected by changes in the aviation industry  customer credit issues or customer bankruptcies 
the downturn in aerospace  particularly the commercial sector  has resulted over the past two years in the bankruptcies of several of our commercial aviation customers 
we regularly review our exposure to customers to determine appropriate loss reserves amounts and credit limits  if any  that should be recorded to cover potential loss as well as determining the strategies that could minimize exposure in case of bankruptcies 
while we believe our current reserves for doubtful accounts are adequate  we could be negatively affected if our receivables from several of our major customers become uncollectible 
during the third quarter of  us airways group and vanguard airlines each filed for bankruptcy protection 
during the fourth quarter of  united airlines filed for bankruptcy and us airways group filed a plan of reorganization 
during the first quarter of  air canada filed for bankruptcy 
aviall services net sales to these customers combined during and were less than million and million  respectively 
at december   our accounts receivable with rolls royce  our largest customer  was million  and we had no collectibility issues 
our sales to rolls royce relate primarily to its role as prime contractor for rr t parts to the us military 
pursuant to our parts agreement with rolls royce  we ship us military orders directly to us military agencies on behalf of rolls royce and then invoice rolls royce for the parts shipped 
inventories 
we make provisions for excess and obsolete inventories based on our assessment of slow moving and obsolete inventories on a part number by part number basis within each product line 
historical parts sales  estimated future demand and product maturity level adjusted for known or expected aviation industry trends or conditions provide the basis for our estimates 
these estimates are subject to volatility and can be affected by reduced flight hours  the retirement of aircraft  changes in distribution agreements and other changes in the aviation industry 
we constantly monitor our inventory levels and forecast potential excess or obsolete parts 
we actively target these potentially excess or obsolete parts for sale 
we make provisions for inventory shrinkage based on periodic physical inventory counts 
distribution rights 
from time to time  we enter into long term supplier distribution agreements that implicitly include a payment for distribution rights 
when we enter into these agreements  we must value the distribution rights and amortize them over the life of the agreement 
we calculate the value of the distribution rights using a discounted cash flow model of the expected net contract cash flows related to the specific distribution agreement 
the most significant variables used in the model include expected sales  inventory value  incremental costs and working capital requirements 
we base our valuation of inventory acquired on the contractual purchase discount off of list price adjusted for historical and expected parts sales 
the determination of the amounts for the other factors used are based on information acquired during the agreement negotiation process 
we amortize the value of the distribution rights over the term of the agreement using the straight line method  which approximates the operating cash flows expected over the life of the agreement 
in the event one or more of our material suppliers discontinue the products we sell  terminate our contract or are unable to perform under our agreement  the value of the distribution rights could be impaired  and we might be required to write down or write off the unamortized value of the distribution rights 
we regularly review these long term supplier distribution agreements to determine any potential impairment by comparing actual to expected performance 

table of contents 
index to financial statements income taxes 
we establish our deferred tax assets and liabilities based on our profits or losses in each jurisdiction in which we operate 
we periodically assess the likelihood of realizing our deferred tax assets and adjust the related valuation allowance based on the amount of deferred tax assets that we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
we base our judgment of the recoverability of our deferred tax asset  which includes us federal and  to a lesser degree  state and foreign nol carryforwards  primarily on historical earnings  our estimate of current and expected future earnings  prudent and feasible tax planning strategies  and current and future ownership changes 
at december   we had a million net deferred tax asset of which million relates to our us federal nol carryforwards 
this equates to a gross us federal nol of approximately million  substantially all of which expires in while we believe we will generate sufficient future us federal taxable income to utilize our us federal nol carryforwards before expiration  we also believe that we may not generate sufficient future taxable income in primarily state and foreign tax jurisdictions to utilize all of our state and foreign nol carryforwards before their expiration 
to fully utilize our net deferred tax assets as of december   we must generate million of taxable income based on current tax rates 
we generated taxable income of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
section imposes limitations on a corporation s ability to utilize us federal nols if it experiences an ownership change 
the amount of the annual limitation can vary significantly based on factors existing at the date of the ownership change 
the value of the corporation s stock immediately before an ownership change is one of the most influential factors affecting the annual limitation calculation 
during  changes in our ownership occurred  but these changes did not result in a limitation on the amount of the nol carryforward that can be utilized 
if we had experienced an ownership change as of december   based on our year end closing stock price of per share  we believe the annual limitation imposed would not have impacted our ability to fully utilize our us federal nol 
a substantial decrease in stock price combined with an ownership change could affect our ability to fully utilize our us federal nol and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows 
we cannot determine the stock price or amount of ownership change which would result in a limitation of our us federal nol carryforward due to various factors  including the timing of a future ownership change and the amount of us taxable earnings earned prior to the ownership change 
pension and postretirement benefits obligations 
the value of our pension and postretirement benefits assets and liabilities is determined on an actuarial basis 
these values are affected by the market value of plan assets  our estimates of the expected return on plan assets and the discount rates we use to value our projected benefit obligation 
we determine the discount rates using changes in the rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments 
we develop our expected long term rate of return assumptions through analysis by asset investment category of historical market returns  the fund s past experience and current market conditions 
actual changes in the fair market value of plan assets  differences between the actual return and the expected return on plan assets and changes in the discount rate we use affect the amount of pension expense we recognize

our cash flow during was stronger than  resulting  we believe  from increased cash earnings and reduced requirements for inventory provisioning for new contracts as compared to the initial rr t inventory investments we made in assuming our current level of internal growth  profitability  and the present relationship between increased revenues  working capital requirements and our annual capital expenditures  we expect to generate strong positive cash flows from operations 
assuming the foregoing  we project cash flow in for operating activities will exceed million 
our cash flow from operating activities does  however  depend on the timing of the delivery and payment for inventory 
in some months  we receive much larger deliveries than the average of the preceding several months 
these larger deliveries can significantly alter our cash flow for that month and on a cumulative basis for both the quarter and the fiscal year to date 
in and  we received large deliveries in november  which when paid for in december reduced our cash flow from operations for that quarter and twelve month period by approximately million 
as a result  in  we expect to fund internal growth  working capital and capital expenditures from cash flow from operations 
in  we do not expect to borrow any material amounts under our credit facility nor to sell debt  equity or other securities on our behalf under our shelf registration statement to fund expected internal growth  working capital and capital expenditures 
however  if we are awarded one or more long term parts agreements in that require significant investments in distribution rights and inventory  if we enter into a strategic acquisition or if our current projections prove to be inaccurate  we may be required to borrow significant amounts under our credit facility or to sell debt  equity or other securities under our shelf registration statement to fund this growth 
liquidity 
we plan to grow our business primarily by selling more of the products we currently distribute  or internal growth  and by selling new products that we obtain the right to sell either through new distribution agreements or through strategic acquisitions  or external growth 
most of the increase in our net sales and earnings over the last several years have been derived from external growth  such as sales generated from the rr t parts fulfillment agreement 
before entering into a distribution agreement for new products or substantially modifying the products distributed under an existing agreement  we prepare a financial model of the expected investment in variable working capital and cash flows under the agreement based on detailed plans  estimates and expectations for introducing and selling the products over the term of the agreement 
we construct our financial model based primarily on the following the upfront investment in initial inventory and purchase of distribution rights  if any  the expected levels of accounts receivable and associated payment terms as compared to the expected levels of accounts payable and associated payment terms  the estimated annual sales and contractual gross margin under the agreement  an assumed sale of the net inventory remaining at the end of the contract term equal to the investment in the inventory

index to financial statements an expected marginal increase in selling and administrative expense resulting from implementing the new agreement  an assumption that the amount of the initial investment in inventory  distribution rights and accounts receivable offset by accounts payable will be a proportion of the annual revenue generated by the sale of the products under the agreement  and will be phased in over a period of approximately days  and an assumption that the investment in distribution rights will be amortized over the term of the agreement and will not have any residual value 
based on this financial model  we determine the expected internal rate of return under the agreement and compare it to our internal rate of return threshold 
if the agreement meets or exceeds our internal rate of return threshold and is otherwise acceptable  we will consider entering into the agreement 
historically  we have funded our internal growth utilizing available cash flows from operations 
external growth has been funded using external financing  such as our credit facility and now retired notes 
our business model assumes that external growth will continue to be funded utilizing external liquidity sources 
we believe that a continuation of our current level of internal growth  profitability  and the present relationship between increased revenues  variable working capital requirements and our annual capital expenditures  will generate positive cash flows from operations  including cash on hand  sufficient to fund all our internal growth and a portion of our external growth requirements related to new business opportunities 
we have no plans to pursue a reduction in our available liquidity and continue to believe this liquidity will provide us with sources to finance new contracts or strategic acquisitions

on june   the carlyle investors converted all of the outstanding shares of series d redeemable preferred stock into  shares of our common stock  following a reduction by our board of directors of the conversion price of the shares of series d redeemable preferred stock from per share to per share

environmental matters aviall services business includes parts repair operations that require the use  storage and disposal of certain chemicals in small quantities 
these chemicals are regulated under various federal  state  local or foreign environmental protection laws which require us to eliminate or mitigate the impact of these substances on the environment 
in response to these requirements  we have upgraded facilities and implemented programs to detect and minimize contamination 
due to the small quantities of chemicals used and the current programs in place  we do not anticipate any material environmental liabilities or significant capital expenditures will be incurred in the future related to our ongoing operations to comply or remain in compliance with existing environmental regulations 
additionally  some of the products  such as chemicals  oxygen generators  oxygen bottles and life rafts  sold by aviall services contain hazardous materials that are subject to faa regulations and various federal  state  local or foreign environmental protections laws 
if aviall services ships such products by air  it shares responsibility with the air carrier for compliance with these faa regulations and is primarily responsible for the proper packaging and labeling of these items 
if aviall services mislabels or otherwise improperly ships hazardous materials  it may be liable for damage to the aircraft and other property  as well as substantial monetary penalties 
any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
the faa actively monitors the shipment of hazardous materials 
certain of our previously owned businesses used certain chemicals classified by various federal  state  local or foreign agencies as hazardous substances 
we retain environmental liabilities related to these businesses for the period prior to their sale 
we are involved in various stages of investigation  cleanup  maintenance and closure to comply with federal  state  local or foreign regulations at these locations 
based on the current information available  we believe existing environmental financial reserves for these previously owned properties are sufficient 
in addition  we are in litigation with a previous owner of three of these locations as to their potential shared liability associated with the cleanup of these sites 
due to the uncertainty of recoverability of this claim  we have not recorded a receivable 
we have been named a potentially responsible party at five third party disposal sites to which wastes were allegedly sent by the previous owner of assets used in our discontinued engine services operations 
we did not use these identified disposal sites 
accordingly  the previous owner has retained  and has been discharging  all liability associated with the cleanup of these sites pursuant to the sales agreement 
although we could be potentially liable in the event of nonperformance by the previous owner  we do not currently anticipate nonperformance 
based on this information  we have not accrued for any costs associated with these third party sites 
in addition  we have two pending lawsuits related to previously owned businesses which we believe to be immaterial

new accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued a revised interpretation no 
 or fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
 replacing the original interpretation issued in january fin r requires certain entities to be consolidated by enterprises that lack majority voting interest when equity investors of those entities have insignificant capital at risk or they lack voting rights  the obligation to absorb expected losses  or the right to received expected returns 
entities identified with these characteristics are called variable interest entities and the interests that enterprises have in these entities are called variable interests 
these interests can derive from certain guarantees  leases  loans or other arrangements that result in risks and rewards that are disproportionate to the voting interests in the entities 
the provisions of fin r must be immediately applied for variable interest entities created after january  and for variable interests in entities commonly referred to as special purpose entities 
for all other variable interest entities  implementation is required by march  because we have no current or planned variable interest entities  the adoption of this statement will not have a significant effect on our consolidated financial position and results of operations

index to financial statements item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
from time to time  we have used financial instruments to offset these risks 
these financial instruments are not used for trading or speculative purposes 
we did not experience any significant changes in market risk during our objective in managing our interest rate risk on our debt is to maintain a reasonable balance of fixed and variable rate debt that will lower our overall borrowing costs within reasonable risk parameters 
interest rate swaps are used to convert a portion of our debt portfolio from a fixed rate to a variable rate 
factored into our decision as to the mix of fixed and variable rate debt are two components the borrowings under the credit facility are at a variable rate and the ability to adjust the prices on a large portion of our inventory for inflation each year 
in november  we entered into an interest rate swap to effectively convert the interest rate from fixed to floating on million of the million principal amount of new senior notes 
under the swap agreement  we pay the london interbank offered rate  or libor  plus an applicable margin 
at december   the interest rate in effect under the swap agreement was  composed of libor of and margin of 
the interest payment and maturity dates of the interest rate swap match the terms of the debt it is intended to modify 
the fair value of our interest rate swap at december  was a liability of million 
fluctuations in the interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt 
at december   we had million of variable rate debt obligations outstanding under our canadian credit facility with a weighted average interest rate of 
the total amount of our variable rate debt was approximately million at december  a hypothetical increase of basis points in the variable interest rate for these borrowings  assuming debt levels at december   would increase interest expense by approximately million
