item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation capital resources 
risk based capital ratio requirements are discussed in greater detail in the following section 
prompt corrective action provisions federal law requires each federal banking agency to take prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of insured financial institutions  including but not limited to those that fall below one or more prescribed minimum capital ratios 
the federal banking agencies have by regulation defined the following five capital categories well capitalized total risk based capital ratio of  tier risk based capital ratio of  and leverage ratio of 
table of contents  adequately capitalized total risk based capital ratio of  tier risk based capital ratio of  and leverage ratio of  or if the institution receives the highest rating from its primary regulator  undercapitalized total risk based capital ratio of less than  tier risk based capital ratio of less than  or leverage ratio of less than  or if the institution receives the highest rating from its primary regulator  significantly undercapitalized total risk based capital ratio of less than  tier risk based capital ratio of less than  or leverage ratio less than  and critically undercapitalized tangible equity to total assets less than 
as of december  and  the bank was deemed to be well capitalized for regulatory capital purposes 
a bank may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if after notice and the opportunity for a hearing  the appropriate federal agency finds an unsafe or unsound condition or practice so warrants  but no bank may be treated as critically undercapitalized unless its actual capital ratio warrants such treatment 
at each successively lower capital category  an insured bank is subject to increased restrictions on its operations 
for example  a bank is generally prohibited from paying management fees to any controlling persons or from making capital distributions if to do so would make the bank undercapitalized 
asset growth and branching restrictions apply to undercapitalized banks  which are required to submit written capital restoration plans meeting specified requirements including a guarantee by the parent holding company  if any 
significantly undercapitalized banks are subject to broad regulatory authority  including among other things  capital directives  forced mergers  restrictions on the rates of interest they may pay on deposits  restrictions on asset growth and activities  and prohibitions on paying certain bonuses without fdic approval 
even more severe restrictions apply to critically undercapitalized banks 
most importantly  except under limited circumstances  not later than days after an insured bank becomes critically undercapitalized  the appropriate federal banking agency is required to appoint a conservator or receiver for the bank 
in addition to measures taken under the prompt corrective action provisions  insured banks may be subject to potential actions by the federal regulators for unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their businesses or for violations of any law  rule  regulation or any condition imposed in writing by the agency or any written agreement with the agency 
enforcement actions may include the issuance of cease and desist orders  termination of insurance of deposits in the case of a bank  the imposition of civil money penalties  the issuance of directives to increase capital  formal and informal agreements  or removal and prohibition orders against institution affiliated parties 
safety and soundness standards the federal banking agencies have also adopted guidelines establishing safety and soundness standards for all insured depository institutions 
those guidelines relate to internal controls  information systems  internal audit systems  loan underwriting and documentation  compensation and interest rate exposure 
in general  the standards are designed to assist the federal banking agencies in identifying and addressing problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired 
if an institution fails to meet these standards  the appropriate federal banking agency may require the institution to submit a compliance plan and institute enforcement proceedings if an acceptable compliance plan is not submitted 
premiums for deposit insurance the fdic regulations also implement a risk based premium system  whereby insured depository institutions are required to pay insurance premiums depending on their risk classification 
under this system  insured banks are categorized into one of three capital categories well capitalized  adequately capitalized  and undercapitalized and one of three supervisory categories based on federal regulatory evaluations 
the three supervisory categories are financially sound with only a few minor weaknesses group a  demonstrates weaknesses that could result in significant deterioration group b  and poses a substantial probability of loss group c 
the capital ratios used by the fdic to define well capitalized  adequately capitalized and undercapitalized are the same in the fdic s prompt corrective action regulations 
the current base assessment rates expressed as cents per of deposits are summarized as follows 
table of contents group a group b group c well capitalized adequately capitalized undercapitalized in addition  banks must pay an amount toward the retirement of the financing corporation bonds issued in the s to assist in the recovery of the savings and loan industry 
this amount fluctuates but for the first quarter of is cents per of insured deposits 
community reinvestment act the bank is subject to certain requirements under the community reinvestment act cra 
the cra generally requires federal banking agencies to evaluate the record of a financial institution in meeting the credit needs of its local communities  including low and moderate income neighborhoods 
the cra further requires the agencies to consider a financial institution s efforts in meeting its community credit needs when evaluating applications for  among other things  domestic branches  consummating mergers or acquisitions  or holding company formations 
in measuring a bank s compliance with its cra obligations  the regulators utilize a performance based evaluation system 
they determine cra ratings based on the bank s actual lending  service and investment activities  rather than on the extent to which the institution conducts needs assessments  documents community outreach activities or complies with other procedural requirements 
in connection with its assessment of cra performance  the fdic assigns a rating of outstanding  satisfactory  needs to improve or substantial noncompliance 
the bank was last examined for cra compliance in june when it received a satisfactory cra assessment rating 
other consumer protection laws and regulations the bank regulatory agencies are increasingly focusing attention on compliance with consumer protection laws and regulations 
examination and enforcement has become intense  and banks have been advised to carefully monitor compliance with various consumer protection laws and regulations 
the federal interagency task force on fair lending issued a policy statement on discrimination in home mortgage lending describing three methods that federal agencies will use to prove discrimination overt evidence of discrimination  evidence of disparate treatment  and evidence of disparate impact 
in addition to cra and fair lending requirements  the bank is subject to numerous other federal consumer protection statutes and regulations 
due to heightened regulatory concern related to compliance with consumer protection laws and regulations generally  the bank may incur additional compliance costs or be required to expend additional funds for investments in the local communities it serves 
interstate banking and branching the riegle neal interstate banking and branching efficiency act of the interstate banking act regulates the interstate activities of banks and bank holding companies and establishes a framework for nationwide interstate banking and branching 
since june   a bank in one state has generally been permitted to merge with a bank in another state without the need for explicit state law authorization 
however  states were given the ability to prohibit interstate mergers with banks in their own state by opting out enacting state legislation applying equality to all out of state banks prohibiting such mergers prior to june  since  adequately capitalized and managed bank holding companies have been permitted to acquire banks located in any state  subject to two exceptions first  any state may still prohibit bank holding companies from acquiring a bank which is less than five years old  and second  no interstate acquisition can be consummated by a bank holding company if the acquirer would control more than of the deposits held by insured depository institutions nationwide or percent or more of the deposits held by insured depository institutions in any state in which the target bank has branches 
a bank may establish and operate de novo branches in any state in which the bank does not maintain a branch if that state has enacted legislation to expressly permit all out of state banks to establish branches in that state 

table of contents in california enacted legislation to implement important provisions of the interstate banking act discussed above and to repeal california s previous interstate banking laws  which were largely preempted by the interstate banking act 
the changes effected by interstate banking act and california laws have increased competition in the environment in which the bank operates to the extent that out of state financial institutions directly or indirectly enter the bank s market areas 
it appears that the interstate banking act has contributed to the accelerated consolidation of the banking industry 
financial modernization act effective march  the gramm leach bliley act eliminated most barriers to affiliations among banks and securities firms  insurance companies  and other financial service providers  and enabled full affiliations to occur between such entities 
this legislation permits bank holding companies to become financial holding companies and thereby acquire securities firms and insurance companies and engage in other activities that are financial in nature 
a bank holding company may become a financial holding company if each of its subsidiary banks is well capitalized under the fdicia prompt corrective action provisions  is well managed  and has at least a satisfactory rating under the cra by filing a declaration that the bank holding company wishes to become a financial holding company 
no regulatory approval will be required for a financial holding company to acquire a company  other than a bank or savings association  engaged in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to activities that are financial in nature  as determined by the federal reserve board 
the company has no current intention of becoming a financial holding company  but may do at some point in the future if deemed appropriate in view of opportunities or circumstances at the time 
the gramm leach bliley act defines financial in nature to include securities underwriting  dealing and market making  sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies  insurance underwriting and agency  merchant banking activities  and activities that the board has determined to be closely related to banking 
a national bank and therefore  a state bank as well may also engage  subject to limitations on investment  in activities that are financial in nature  other than insurance underwriting  insurance company portfolio investment  real estate development and real estate investment  through a financial subsidiary of the bank  if the bank is well capitalized  well managed and has at least a satisfactory cra rating 
subsidiary banks of a financial holding company or national banks with financial subsidiaries must continue to be well capitalized and well managed in order to continue to engage in activities that are financial in nature without regulatory actions or restrictions  which could include divestiture of the financial in nature subsidiary or subsidiaries 
in addition  a financial holding company or a bank may not acquire a company that is engaged in activities that are financial in nature unless each of the subsidiary banks of the financial holding company or the bank has a cra rating of satisfactory or better 
the gramm leach bliley act also imposes extensive requirements on financial institutions with respect to the privacy of customer information  and modifies other existing laws  including those related to community reinvestment 
usa patriot act of on october   president bush signed the usa patriot act of the patriot act 
enacted in response to the terrorist attacks in new york  pennsylvania and washington  dc on september   the patriot act is intended to strengthen the ability of us law enforcement agencies and intelligence communities to work cohesively to combat terrorism on a variety of fronts 
the impact of the act on financial institutions of all kinds is significant and wide ranging 
the act contains sweeping anti money laundering and financial transparency laws and requires various regulations applicable to financial institutions  including due diligence requirements for financial institutions that administer  maintain  or manage private bank accounts or correspondent accounts for non us persons  standards for verifying customer identification at account opening  and rules to promote cooperation among financial institutions  regulators  and law enforcement entities in identifying parties that may be involved in terrorism or money laundering 

table of contents the company has incorporated the requirements of the patriot act into its operating procedures  and while these requirements have resulted in an additional time burden the financial impact on the company is difficult to quantify 
sarbanes oxley act of the sarbanes oxley act of soa was enacted to increase corporate responsibility  to provide for enhanced penalties for accounting and auditing improprieties at publicly traded companies  and to protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of corporate disclosures pursuant to the securities laws 
the soa generally applies to all companies  both us and us  that file or are required to file periodic reports under the securities exchange act of  including the company 
the soa includes very specific additional disclosure requirements and new corporate governance rules  requires the sec and securities exchanges to adopt extensive additional disclosure  corporate governance and other related rules and mandates further studies of specified issues by the securities and exchange commission and the comptroller general 
the soa represents significant federal involvement in matters traditionally left to state regulatory systems  such as the regulation of the accounting profession  and to state corporate law  such as the relationship between a board of directors and management and between a board of directors and its committees 
the soa contains provisions which became effective upon enactment on july  and provisions which became effective from within days to one year from enactment 
the securities and exchange commission has promulgated regulations to implement various provisions of the soa  including additional disclosure requirements in periodic filings under the exchange act 
the company has revised its internal policies and exchange act disclosures to comply with these new requirements 
other pending and proposed legislation other legislative and regulatory initiatives which could affect the company  the bank and the banking industry in general are pending  and additional initiatives may be proposed or introduced before the united states congress  the california legislature and other governmental bodies in the future 
such proposals  if enacted  may further alter the structure  regulation and competitive relationship among financial institutions  and may subject the bank to increased regulation  disclosure and reporting requirements 
in addition  the various banking regulatory agencies often adopt new rules and regulations to implement and enforce existing legislation 
it cannot be predicted whether  or in what form  any such legislation or regulations may be enacted or the extent to which the business of the company or the bank would be affected thereby 
risk factors statements and financial discussion and analysis by management contained throughout this report that are not historical facts are forward looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of forward looking statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from forward looking statements herein include  without limitation  the factors set forth below 
poor economic conditions in our market areas may cause us to suffer higher default rates on our loans and leases 
a substantial majority of our assets and deposits are generated in the san joaquin valley in central california 
as a result  poor economic conditions in the san joaquin valley could cause us to incur losses associated with higher default rates and decreased collateral values in our loan portfolio 
the local economy currently appears to be experiencing a moderate expansion  and while the company expects continued improvement  no assurance can be given that this will occur 
the san joaquin valley has not experienced the same type of growth that has historically occurred in other areas of california  especially those where high tech industries have taken hold 
while this fact minimized the negative impact of the recent technology related downturn  unemployment levels are still relatively high 
in the visalia tulare porterville metropolitan statistical area msa  for example  which is our geographic center and the base of our 
table of contents agriculturally oriented communities  the unemployment rate has averaged around for the past four years 
while unemployment levels remain relatively high in all of the company s markets  in recent years some areas in the south and central san joaquin valley have experienced substantial commercial growth 
the area s relatively inexpensive real estate and central proximity to both southern and northern california have attracted a growing number of warehouse and distribution facilities  as well as manufacturing  health  and other service companies 
the low cost of housing has also drawn retirees from more expensive areas of california 
poor economic conditions affecting the agricultural industry could have an adverse effect on our customers and their ability to make payments to us 
the company s balance of non performing assets is relatively high due in large part to persistent agricultural difficulties 
furthermore  a sizable portion of our total loan portfolio consists of loans to borrowers either directly or indirectly involved in the agricultural industry 
while a great number of our borrowers may not be individually involved in agriculture  many of the jobs in the san joaquin valley are ancillary to the regular production  processing  marketing and sales of agricultural commodities 
the ripple effect of lower commodity prices for milk  nuts  olives  grapes  tree fruit and oranges has a tendency to spread to lower land prices  lower borrower income  and lower collateral values 
weather patterns in particular are of critical importance to row crop  tree fruit  and orange production 
a degenerative cycle of weather and commodity prices can impact consumer purchasing power  which has the potential to create further unemployment throughout the san joaquin valley 
global competition is another significant issue affecting the agricultural industry 
because of increased global competition and other factors  excess supply and low prices currently characterize the markets for many agricultural products 
if current agricultural conditions do not improve  our level of non performing assets could increase further 
such conditions have affected and may continue to adversely affect our borrower base and negatively impact our business 
concentrations of real estate loans could subject us to increased risks in the event of a real esate recession or natural disaster 
our loan portfolio is heavily concentrated in real estate loans  particularly commercial real estate 
at december   of our loan portfolio consisted of loans secured by real estate 
between the end of and the end of  our loans secured by commercial professional office properties including construction and development loans increased from to of total loans  while loans secured by residential properties have decreased form to 
in the early s  the entire state of california experienced an economic recession that particularly impacted real estate values and resulted in increases in the level of delinquencies and losses for many financial institutions 
much of our market area seems to have been insulated from the significant fluctuations in real estate prices experienced by other parts of california over the past few decades 
however  if a similar real estate recession affects our market areas in the future  the security for many of our loans could be reduced in value and the ability of some of our borrowers to pay could decline 
similarly  the occurrence of a natural disaster like those california has experienced in the past  including earthquakes  brush fires  and flooding  could impair the value of the collateral we hold for real estate secured loans and negatively impact our results of operations 
we may have difficulty managing our growth 
management intends to leverage the company s current infrastructure to grow assets  and one to two new branches per year are also tentatively planned  although no assurance can be provided that this strategy will result in significant growth 
our ability to manage growth will depend primarily on our ability to monitor and manage expanded operations  control funding costs and operating expenses  maintain positive customer relations  and attract  assimilate and retain qualified personnel 
if we fail to achieve those objectives in an efficient and timely manner we may experience disruptions in our business plans  and our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
our earnings are subject to interest rate risk 
the earnings of most financial institutions depend largely on the relationship between the cost of funds  primarily deposits and borrowings  and the yield on earning assets such as loans and investment securities 
this relationship  known as the interest rate spread  is subject to fluctuation and is 
table of contents affected by economic  regulatory and competitive factors that influence interest rates  the volume and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and the level of non performing assets 
many of these factors are beyond our control 
fluctuations in interest rates affect the demand of customers for our products and services  and the company is subject to interest rate risk to the degree that our interest bearing liabilities re price or mature more slowly or more rapidly or on a different basis than our interest earning assets 
given the current volume  mix  and re pricing characteristics of the company s interest bearing liabilities and interest earning assets  our interest rate spread should not change significantly if interest rates rise or fall 
however  there are scenarios where fluctuations in interest rates in either direction could have a negative effect on net income 
for example  if funding rates rise faster than asset yields in a rising rate environment ie  if basis compression occurs  or if we do not continue to actively manage certain loan index rates in a declining rate environment  we would be negatively impacted 
we operate in a competitive market dominated by banks and other financial services providers  many of which have lower cost structures and offer more services 
in california generally  and in our primary service area specifically  branches of major banks dominate the commercial banking industry 
by virtue of their larger capital base  such institutions have substantially greater lending limits than we have  and perform certain functions for their customers  including trust services and international banking  which we are not equipped to offer directly but some of which we offer indirectly through correspondent relationships 
many of these banks also operate with economies of scale that result in lower operating costs on a per loan or per asset basis 
we also compete with other financial institutions such as savings and loan associations  credit unions  thrift and loan companies  mortgage companies  securities brokerage companies and insurance companies  and with quasi financial institutions such as money market funds for deposits and loans 
financial services like ours are increasingly offered over the internet on a national and international basis  and we compete with providers of these services as well 
ultimately  competition can drive down our interest margins and reduce our profitability 
it can also make it more difficult for us to continue to increase the size of our loan and deposit portfolios 
you may have difficulty selling your shares in the future if a more active trading market for our stock does not develop 
although sierra bancorp s common stock has been listed on the nasdaq national market since august  the effective date of the holding company reorganization and bank of the sierra s common stock was previously listed on the nasdaq national market since june   trading in our stock has not been extensive and cannot be characterized as amounting to an active trading market 
we may experience loan and lease losses in excess of our allowance for loan and lease losses 
we are careful in our loan underwriting process in order to limit the risk that borrowers might fail to repay  nevertheless  losses can and do occur 
we create an allowance for estimated loan and lease losses in our accounting records  based on estimates of the following industry standards  historical experience with our loans  evaluation of economic conditions  regular reviews of the quality mix and size of the overall loan portfolio  regular reviews of delinquencies  and the quality of the collateral underlying our loans 
we maintain an allowance for loan and lease losses at a level that we believe is adequate to absorb any specifically identified losses as well as any other losses inherent in our loan portfolio 
however  changes in economic  operating and other conditions  including changes in interest rates  that are beyond our control  may cause our actual loan losses to exceed our current allowance estimates 
if actual losses exceed the amount reserved  it will have a negative impact on our profitability 
in addition  the fdic and the department of financial institutions  as part of their supervisory functions  periodically review our allowance for loan and lease losses 
such agencies may require us to increase our provision for loan and lease losses or to recognize further losses  based on their judgments  which may be different from those of our management 
any increase in the allowance required by the fdic or the department of financial institutions could also hurt our business 

table of contents our directors and executive officers control a near majority of our stock  and your interests may not always be the same as those of the board and management 
as of february   our directors and executive officers  together with their affiliates  beneficially owned approximately of the bank s outstanding voting stock including vested option shares 
as a result  if all of these shareholders were to take a common position  they could most likely control the outcome of most corporate actions  such as approval of mergers or other business combinations  sales of all or substantially all of our assets  any matters submitted to a vote of our shareholders  issuance of any additional common stock or other equity securities  incurrence of debt other than in the ordinary course of business  the selection and tenure of our chief executive officer  and payment of dividends on common stock or other equity securities 
in some situations  the interests of our directors and executive officers may be different from yours 
however  our board of directors and executive officers have a fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of the shareholders  rather than in their own best interests  when considering a proposed business combination or any of these types of matters 
provisions in our articles of incorporation will delay or prevent changes in control of our corporation or our management 
these provisions make it more difficult for another company to acquire us  which could reduce the market price of our common stock and the price that you receive if you sell your shares in the future 
these provisions include the following staggered terms of office for members of the board of directors  the elimination of cumulative voting in the election of directors  and a requirement that our board of directors consider the potential social and economic effects on our employees  depositors  customers and the communities we serve as well as certain other factors  when evaluating a possible tender offer  merger or other acquisition of the company

both visalia branches are leased from unrelated parties 
in addition  the company operates a technology center in porterville which consists of approximately  square feet in a freestanding single story building that is leased from unrelated parties 
the bank has five remote atm locations leased from unrelated parties  although the amount of monthly rent at these locations is minimal 
management believes that the company s existing back office facilities are adequate to accommodate the company s operations for the immediately foreseeable future  although limited branch expansion is planned 
item legal proceedings from time to time  the company is a party to claims and legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business 
after taking into consideration information furnished by counsel to the company as to the current status of these claims or proceedings to which the company is a party  management is of the opinion that the ultimate aggregate liability represented thereby  if any  will not have a material adverse affect on the financial condition of the company

shareholders of record at the company s stock transfer agent totaled  while street name holders totaled about  c dividends as a bank holding company that currently has no significant assets other than its equity interest in the bank  the company s ability to declare dividends depends primarily upon dividends it receives from the bank 
the bank s dividend practices in turn depend upon the bank s earnings  financial position  current and anticipated capital requirements and other factors deemed relevant by the bank s board of directors at that time 
the company paid cash dividends totaling million  or per share in  and million or per share in  representing of the prior year s earnings for both years 
the company s general dividend policy is to pay cash dividends of approximately the prior year s net earnings  provided that such payments do not adversely affect the company s financial condition and are not overly restrictive to its growth capacity 
however  no assurance can be given that earnings and or growth expectations in any given year will justify the payment of such a dividend 

table of contents during any period in which the company has deferred payment of interest otherwise due and payable on its subordinated debt securities  it may not make any dividends or distributions with respect to its capital stock see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations capital resources 
the power of the bank s board of directors to declare cash dividends is also subject to statutory and regulatory restrictions which limit the amount available for cash dividends depending upon the earnings  financial condition and cash needs of the bank  as well as general business conditions 
under california banking law  the bank may declare dividends in an amount not exceeding the lesser of its retained earnings or its net income for the last three years reduced by dividends paid during such period or  with the prior approval of the california commissioner of financial institutions  in an amount not exceeding the greatest of i the retained earnings of the bank  ii the net income of the bank for its last fiscal year  or iii the net income of the bank for its current fiscal year 
the payment of any cash dividends by the bank will depend not only upon the bank s earnings during a specified period  but also on the bank meeting certain regulatory capital requirements 
the company s ability to pay dividends is also limited by state corporation law 
the california general corporation law prohibits the company from paying dividends on the common stock unless i its retained earnings  immediately prior to the dividend payment  equals or exceeds the amount of the dividend or ii immediately after giving effect to the dividend the sum of the company s assets exclusive of goodwill and deferred charges would be at least equal to of its liabilities not including deferred taxes  deferred income and other deferred liabilities and the current assets of the company would be at least equal to its current liabilities  or  if the average of its earnings before taxes on income and before interest expense for the two preceding fiscal years was less than the average of its interest expense for the two preceding fiscal years  at least equal to of its current liabilities

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion presents management s analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of the company as of and for each of the years in the three year period ended december  the discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the company and the notes related thereto presented elsewhere in this form k annual report see item below 
statements contained in this report or incorporated by reference that are not purely historical are forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of as amended  including the company s expectations  intentions  beliefs  or strategies regarding the future 
all forward looking statements concerning economic conditions  rates of growth  rates of income or values as may be included in this document are based on information available to the company on the date noted  and the company assumes no obligation to update any such forward looking statements 
it is important to note that the company s actual results could materially differ from those in such forward looking statements 
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in such forward looking statements include but are not limited to fluctuations in interest rates  inflation  government regulations  economic conditions  customer disintermediation and competitive product and pricing pressures in the geographic and business areas in which the company conducts its operations 
critical accounting policies the company s financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the financial information contained within these statements is  to a significant extent  based on approximate measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred 
critical accounting policies are those that involve the most complex and subjective decisions and assessments  and have the greatest potential impact on the company s stated results of operations 
in management s opinion  the company s critical accounting policies deal with the following areas the establishment of the company s allowance for loan losses  as explained in detail in the provision for loan losses and allowance for loan losses sections of this discussion and analysis  the annual evaluation of goodwill for impairment  and the accrual of the company s tax liability  particularly as it relates to the inclusion of benefits from the reit  as detailed in the section on income taxes in this discussion and analysis 
summary of performance the company again achieved record earnings in in fact  net income has increased in of the last years 
net income in was million  an increase of more than million  or  over the million in net earnings recognized in net income in was million higher than net earnings of million 
net income per basic share was for  as compared to during and in the company s return on average assets roa was and return on average equity roe was in  as compared to and  respectively in  and and  respectively for the following were significant factors relevant to the company s results of operations for the most recent three years net interest income was the major contributor to the increase in net income in the million  or  increase in net interest income was primarily the result of growth in average earning assets and a basis point improvement in net interest margin 
relatively strong growth in average core deposits was the most significant driver of the net interest margin increase 
in the largest gain was also in net interest income  which came from million growth in average earning assets and a basis point improvement in the company s net interest margin 
the net interest margin increased in mainly because of a relatively stable interest rate environment during most of that allowed the company to maintain its cost of funds at record low levels 
in  the company s interest earning assets repriced more quickly that its interest bearing liabilities during a record drop in interest rates  which had a negative impact on the company s net interest margin that year 
non interest income showed healthy improvement in  increasing by million  or 
service charges on deposits increased by  or  due to the increase in demand deposit accounts  and a 
table of contents  increase in bank owned life insurance boli income was also a significant factor in the overall increase in non interest income 
the bulk of the company s boli investments were made in september and october of non interest expenses were held to a increase in  despite increases of almost in salaries and employee benefits  and occupancy and fixed asset expenses 
those increases  which were in part the result of a conversion to in house item processing in september of and the addition of a branch in  were partially offset by savings from the elimination of outsourced item processing costs in outsourced item processing costs totaled million in the provision for loan losses was  lower in despite significant growth in the company s loan portfolio  because most of the growth was comprised of loans secured by real estate which have a lower historical loss factor and due to the fact that net loan charge offs were lower in than in the provision for income taxes experienced a disproportionate increase of million  or  from to  while pre tax income increased by million  or only  for the same periods 
the increase in the tax accrual rate in was due to the company s decision in the fourth quarter of to reverse all tax benefits derived during the year from the company s real estate investment trust reit 
the increase in the company s tax provision would have been even higher in if not for higher boli income  which is tax exempt  and additional low income housing investment tax credits 
the following are important factors in understanding our financial condition and liquidity  which remain strong total assets grew by million  or  from million at the end of to million at the end of most of this increase came from growth in loan balances  and because most of the loan expansion occurred in the latter half of the impact on annual average balances was not as great as it might otherwise have been 
gross loan and lease balances increased by million  mainly from growth in real estate secured loans 
the majority of the increase in loan balances was generated in high growth markets located within the company s geographic footprint  however net loan participations added approximately million from outside our primary service area 
cash and due from banks was million lower at december  than at december   primarily due to timing differences in the collection of cash items 
the annual average balance of cash and due from banks was million in  relative to million in an important shift in the composition of the company s balance sheet was seen in loans and leases  which increased to of total assets at december  from at the end of a notable change in deposits from the end of to the end of was a million  or  increase in demand deposit balances 
non interest bearing deposits increased to of total deposits at the end of as compared to at the end of other interest bearing core deposits increased by a combined million  or  despite historically low interest rates 
these core deposit increases were the result of focused marketing and increased cross selling efforts 
management intends to continue these activities  although no assurance can be given that core deposits will continue in the same growth patterns  and the possibility exists that a change in the interest rate environment or changes in the relative returns of non deposit products such as mutual funds or bonds could lead to disintermediation 
short term borrowings increased from to of total liabilities 
the increase in short term funding balances was mainly the result of overnight borrowings that were being used as an interim measure to fund the rapid loan growth that occurred in the latter half of the year 

table of contents total shareholders equity increased to million at december  from million at december   due primarily to the retention of earnings less dividends paid 
this is an increase of million  or about 
the company s total risk based capital ratio at december  was results of operations during the company generated net income of million as compared to million in and million in the company earns income from two primary sources 
the first is net interest income  which is interest income generated by earning assets less interest expense on interest bearing liabilities 
the second is non interest income  which primarily consists of customer service charges and fees but also comes from non customer sources such as loan sales  bank owned life insurance  and gains on sales from the company s investment portfolio 
the majority of the company s non interest expenses are operating costs that relate to providing a full range of banking services to our customers 
net interest income and net interest margin net interest income was million in compared to million and million in and  respectively 
this represents an increase of in over  and an increase of in over the level of net interest income depends on several factors in combination  including yields on earning assets  the cost of interest bearing liabilities  the relative volume of total earning assets and total interest bearing liabilities  and the mix of products which comprise the company s earning assets  deposits  and other interest bearing liabilities 
the volume and rate variances table which follows sets forth the dollar amount of changes in interest earned and paid for each major category of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the amount of change attributable to changes in average balances volume changes or changes in average interest rates 
volume changes are calculated by multiplying the change in the average balance by the prior period rate  whereas rate changes are equal to the change in average rate times the current period balance 
the variances attributable to both the volume and rate changes have been allocated to the change in rate

as shown in the table  volume variances contributed million to net interest income  while unfavorable changes in interest rates offset the favorable volume variance by  for a net increase of million in net interest income 
the positive volume variance is mainly due to growth in average earning assets and a significant increase in demand deposits  which diminished the need for interest bearing liabilities to fund asset growth 
note that growth in earning assets added million to interest income  while growth in interest bearing liabilities added only  to interest expense 
the detrimental rate movement was the result of the re pricing characteristics of the bank s rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
volume and rate variances are discussed more fully in the paragraphs following the distribution  rate  and yield table 
the following distribution  rate and yield table shows  for each of the past three years  the annual average balance for each principal balance sheet category  and the amount of interest income or interest expense associated with that category

table of contents a substantial portion of the company s earning assets are variable rate loans that re price immediately when the company s prime lending rate is changed  versus a large base of core deposits that are generally slower to re price 
this timing difference causes the company to be slightly asset sensitive  which means that all else being equal  the company s net interest margin will be lower during periods when short term interest rates are falling and higher when rates are rising 
in  shorter term interest rates continued their declining trend of the previous two years and fell by another basis points 
the establishment of informal floors on certain variable loan rates  however  minimized the impact of declining rates during the converse of this hedge for declining rates is that net interest income will not increase as rapidly in a rising rate environment 
in  floors on loan rates and aggressive reductions in the pricing of deposit products also resulted in a fairly stable net interest margin  which showed significant improvement over during most of  a precipitous drop in interest rates had a sustained negative impact on the company s net interest margin as assets re priced more quickly than liabilities 
exacerbating the timing effect was the narrowing of the relative spread between loan and deposit rates as market rates moved lower 
a positive factor impacting the company s net interest margin in both and was a favorable shift in the mix of the company s deposits and other interest bearing liabilities 
for  average interest bearing deposits fell slightly relative to average total liabilities and shareholders equity  dropping to from  and borrowed funds also declined to from 
making up the difference was million  or growth in average non interest bearing demand deposits  which increased to from of average total liabilities and shareholders equity 
in  the increase in average demand deposit balances was million  or  relative to the new fresno branch opened in june of  and increased cross selling efforts and marketing campaigns targeting checking accounts were in effect during much of the year  all of which contributed to the increase in demand deposit balances in in addition to their decline relative to total liabilities and equity  there were income enhancing changes within interest bearing deposits 
substantial volume growth occurred in relatively low cost savings accounts  which increased by million  or  for in comparison to  and expanded to from of average interest bearing deposits 
average money market account balances increased by million  or  in relative to  growing to from of average interest bearing deposits

the changes in customer core deposit balances may be due in part to uncertainty in equity markets and the desire of our customers to minimize their risk of principal loss  as insured bank deposits are currently viewed as a safe haven relative to other investment products 
however  as depositors feel more secure with alternative investments  the company could be forced to pay increasingly more for deposits to avoid potential run off  even if other interest rates remain static 
from to  the company s average loan portfolio grew by approximately million  or  with earnings on that growth  net of associated funding costs  contributing to net interest income 
since most of the growth in occurred in the last half of the year  the increase in annual average balances is significantly lower than the million increase in actual balances from the end of to the end of furthermore  loan balances  which are the highest yielding component of the company s earning assets  have become a larger portion of the company s average asset base  increasing to of average assets in from in conversely  average investment balances have declined relative to total assets  to in from in  due primarily to a decrease in fed funds sold 
having a negative effect on the company s net interest margin in was an million  or  increase in average non earning assets 
this increase was centered in the company s boli and low income housing tax credit fund investments  which averaged million and million  respectively in  but only million and million  respectively in these assets  while having a positive impact on the company s profitability with expected tax equivalent returns in the to range  are technically not interest earning assets 
their returns are not included as interest income  yet they are funded for the most part with interest bearing liabilities and thus these balances ultimately have a negative impact on the company s net interest margin 
management estimates that this impact was not more than a few basis points in  although it would become more significant in a rising rate environment 
this should be more than offset  however  by increases in other income from gains in the net cash surrender value of boli and tax credits generated by the low income housing tax credit funds 

table of contents management anticipates that the company s current net interest margin will not vary significantly under any likely interest rate scenario  and net interest income will increase if loans grow as planned and the loan growth is funded by reasonably priced deposits 
however  no assurance can be given that this will  in fact  occur 
non interest income and non interest expense the company s results reflect a million  or  increase in non interest income for relative to non interest income was million in and million in  and increased to from of average earning assets 
non interest expense was million in versus million in  an increase of million  or 
non interest expense increased slightly as a percentage of average earning assets  growing to in from in because the increase in net interest plus other income in was proportionately greater than the increase in non interest expenses  the company s overhead efficiency ratio fell

during  the company also realized substantial gains on the sale of investment securities  and from the sale of loan servicing rights it had retained on previously sold residential mortgage loans 
loan sale income and loan 
table of contents servicing income are becoming less significant components of the company s profitability  while boli income has gained in importance 
other service charges and fees have also increased in relative importance to the company over the past three years  and non recurring gains from the sale of foreclosed properties boosted other income in taking investment gains out of the equation  and excluding non recurring gains of approximately  on the sale of other real estate owned in and about  on loan servicing in  combined loan sale and servicing income fell to of recurring non interest income in from in and using the same denominator  boli income increased to in from in and in  while other service charges  commissions fees increased to in from in and in the most significant source of non interest income to the company continues to be service charges on deposit accounts  however  which totaled million in  million in  and million in the company s ratio of service charge income to average transaction accounts demand and interest bearing now accounts was in  as compared to in and for other service charges  commissions  and fees also constitute a substantial portion of non interest income  and totaled million in  million in  and  in the largest items comprising the  increase in are the following a combined  increase in check card interchange and atm fees  which came mostly from increased activity but was also impacted by a fourth quarter transaction fee adjustment  a  increase in mortgage loan referral fees resulting from a relatively high level of re financing activity  the receipt of  in interest on income tax refunds  rental income totaling  received on other real estate owned  and  in rental income generated by operating leases 
the bulk of the increase in was the result of higher check card interchange fees 
boli income  which is not taxable  is generated by the increase in the cash surrender values of bank owned life insurance policies net of the cost of the associated insurance benefits and certain consulting expenses 
this income increased by approximately  in to a total of  which reflects a full year of income from the million boli purchase made in september and october of income from loan sales was  in   in  and  in while the company still originates and sells a certain number of residential mortgage loans primarily those associated with its all in one construction through permanent financing product  in march of the company restructured its mortgage lending group to reduce expenses and began outsourcing the majority of its residential mortgage loan origination services to moneyline lending  inc this resulted in a drop off in loan sales income  although moneyline pays the company referral fees for successfully closed loans 
moneyline fees are reflected in other service charges  commissions and fees  and totaled approximately  in and  in since those fees are dependent on the volume of closed residential mortgage loans  no assurance can be given that the current level of income will continue to be realized 
loan servicing income reached unusual levels in  when non recurring gains of approximately  were realized on the sale of the loan servicing rights the company had retained on previously sold residential mortgage loans 
pursuant to a detailed analysis of the loan servicing area  management determined that loan servicing revenue was not sufficient to cover associated costs and maintain a reasonable profit margin  and decided to sell the servicing rights on its residential loan servicing portfolio 
with the sale of most of the company s loan servicing portfolio  recurring loan servicing income excluding one time gains has dropped off substantially and was only  in compared to  in and  in  although associated expenses have also declined 
credit card fees increased by  or  to  in from  in these fees expanded by a much greater amount in  however  with the addition of an annual fee for participation in the company s score card program 
for relative to credit card fees increased by  or 
with no plans for significant growth in credit card receivables  credit card fees will likely stay at about the same level in the  gain on investment securities in is primarily comprised of liquidating dividends resulting from the company s investment in sphinx  as that company completed its planned dissolution 
other gains from municipal bonds called in were offset by the company s write off of its  investment in california bankers insurance agency  subsequent to the receipt from them of correspondence alerting the company to their 
table of contents dissolution 
the  gain in was also largely due to  in liquidating dividends from sphinx  less the write off of the remaining  book value of that equity investment 
the total gain on investments in was significantly higher than in the two subsequent years 
the decline in market interest rates in caused escalation in the market value of the company s investment portfolio  which is substantially comprised of fixed rate bonds  and the company was able to realize some of those gains as bonds were sold during the year 
also of note is the  or increase in other income in  which was mainly the result of non recurring gains from the sale of other real estate owned but also includes a  increase in rental income from investment centers of america  which is in the form of percentage rents based on gross commissions generated 
the largest dollar increase in for any single non interest expense category was in salaries and employee benefits  which increased by million  or  to million 
these expenses also increased relative to total non interest expense  going to in from in regular salaries not including overtime  temp costs  or incentive pay increased by in and contributed about million to the overall increase in total salaries and employee benefits 
since annual increases for existing employees averaged less than  or about  the rest of the increase in regular salaries is due to staff additions 
salaries and benefits in include staffing costs for the branch added in june  and reflect a full year of item processing personnel who came on board in august of furthermore  there were selective staff additions in our branches to boost business development activities  and back office staff additions to enhance customer service 
the increase in salaries and benefits in also includes an approximate  increase in accruals for salary continuation agreements  which were adopted for certain key employees in the fourth quarter of in conjunction with the company s purchase of boli 
as intended  however  boli income more than offset expense accruals for salary continuation agreements  as well as accruals for the directors retirement plan discussed later in this section 
most of the remaining increase in compensation expenses can be explained by the rising cost of benefits 
the company s workers compensation premiums nearly doubled  increasing by  per year to a total of  for  and group health insurance costs were up by  despite an increase in the percentage of premiums reimbursed by employees 
based on market analysis and peer comparisons  it is management s opinion that the company can achieve future growth in loans and deposits with only minimal increases in staff 
thus  it is expected that salaries and employee benefits will decline as a percentage of earning assets over the next few years  although there is no guaranty that this will actually occur 
the number of full time equivalent employees was at the end of  at the end of  and at the end of total rent and occupancy costs  including furniture and equipment expenses  were million in  million in  and million in the annual increase in these expenses was  or for  and  or in  and they rose to of total non interest expense in from in approximately half of the increase in is related to the inclusion of costs for a full year of the in house item processing operation  in the form of rent expense and depreciation on the equipment and tenant improvements  whereas in house item processing was only in operation for about one quarter in in late our data processing operations also relocated to the same building utilized by item processing  further increasing rent expense 
the new branch that commenced operations in fresno in june was another factor in the increase in rent and occupancy expense 
furthermore  security services were enhanced in  which created an additional  in what are likely to be ongoing occupancy expenses 
although relatively minor in  it should also be pointed out that depreciation related to operating leases will likely grow and is expected to become an increasingly significant portion of equipment expense in the future 
total data processing costs dropped by million  or  to a total of million in item processing outsourcing costs were completely eliminated in  but totaled million in other data processing costs increased by  or  due mainly to termination fees and other costs associated with the company s conversion of its core banking and online banking software in january of deposit services costs fell by  or  in primarily because of lower atm network costs 
loan services expenses were down by  or 
this decline was mainly the result of more accurate tracking and aggressive collection efforts for appraisal and inspection costs  but also reflects a slight decline in mortgage servicing costs 
the total cost of professional services was million in  million in  and million in while professional services expenses increased by  or  in  they dropped by  or 
table of contents  in relative to  since includes about  in costs associated with forming the holding company 
included in the net increase is a drop of  in legal and accounting fees and a  increase in the cost of other professional services 
legal and accounting costs declined by a net in relative to  due to the following audit and tax costs fell by  because included  in fees associated with formation of the company s reit  legal costs were  or lower  mainly because of lower legal costs related to collections  and payments to consultants for compliance  loan  and operations reviews increased by  due to the increased size and complexity of the company 
the majority of the increase in other professional services in is explained by the fact that includes a full year of accruals for a retirement plan for directors that was adopted effective october  in conjunction with the purchase of boli 
these accruals were approximately  higher in than in the other operating costs category includes telecommunications  postage  and other miscellaneous costs  and totaled million in  million in  and million in these expenses increased by  or in  and  or in other operating expenses for relative to include approximately  more in accruals for estimated operating losses on the company s investments in low income housing tax credit funds 
the losses are an expected component of these investments  and are factored into the initial assessment of projected returns 
this increase was partially offset by an  reduction in telecommunications expenses resulting from the restructuring of telephone and data line configurations  and a  reduction in postage costs 
we are increasingly focused on enhancing fee income and controlling overhead expenses to mitigate the potential effect of intensified competition on the company s net interest margin 
improvement is evident in the company s tax equivalent overhead efficiency ratio  which dropped to in from for and in no assurance can be given that future reductions in the company s efficiency ratio can be achieved as planned 
provision for loan and lease losses credit risk is inherent in the business of making loans and leases 
the company sets aside an allowance or reserve for loan and lease losses through charges to earnings  which are shown in the income statement as the provision for loan and lease losses 
specifically identifiable and quantifiable losses are immediately charged off against the allowance 
the loan and lease loss provision is determined by conducting a monthly evaluation of the adequacy of the company s allowance for loan and lease losses  and charging the shortfall  if any  to the current month s expense 
this has the effect of creating variability in the amount and frequency of charges to the company s earnings 
the procedures for monitoring the adequacy of the allowance  as well as detailed information concerning the allowance itself  are included below under allowance for loan and lease losses 
the company s provision for loan and lease losses was million in  million in  and million in the provision in was  lower than in due in part to lower net charge offs  which fell by  in to million 
because the provision exceed charge offs during  the company s allowance for loan and lease losses increased by  or 
subsequent to a thorough review of the allowance relative to the current size and composition of the company s loan and lease portfolio  this increase has been judged by management to be adequate to maintain the allowance at an appropriate level 
income taxes in  the company s provision for state and federal income taxes was million  while the provision was million and million  respectively  for and this represents of income before taxes in  in  and in the tax accrual rate declined substantially in from the rate in due primarily to the tax impact of the real estate investment trust  but also because of tax credits generated by low income housing investments and interest deductions for enterprise zone loans  all of which are described in more detail below 
the effective tax rate increased in relative to due to the suspension of real estate investment trust tax benefits  as discussed below  but the tax credits have been increased and enterprise zone deductions remain  thus the effective rate is still lower than in 
table of contents the company sets aside a provision for income taxes on a monthly basis 
as indicated in note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  the amount of such provision is determined by applying the company s statutory income tax rates to pre tax book income as adjusted for permanent differences between pre tax book income and actual taxable income 
these permanent differences include but are not limited to tax exempt income  increases in the cash surrender value of boli  california enterprise zone deductions  certain expenses that are not allowed as tax deductions  and tax credits 
an additional permanent difference arose as a result of the formation of a real estate investment trust reit which began operations in august the reit was formed to provide the company with greater flexibility in managing its capital  but had the added benefit of providing california income tax benefits 
the company adjusted its tax accrual effective august to allow for the year to date impact of the reit  and the total tax accrual for was approximately  lower than it otherwise would have been 
we continued to recognize this tax benefit through most of however  because of an adverse interpretation of existing law that was released by the california franchise tax board ftb on december   effective as of that date the company reversed all reit related tax benefits recognized during that year and suspended the recognition of those benefits going forward 
california tax laws relating to reit s have not changed and our reit tax advisors a national accounting firm have affirmed their initial tax opinion  thus we do not expect the ftb s interpretation to go unchallenged 
no assurance can be given that the tax benefits originally expected to be generated by the reit will be realized for or future years  however 
in addition  there appears to be a strong possibility that the ftb will contest tax benefits realized from the reit in if those benefits are ultimately reversed  the company would be required to pay the additional tax  interest  and possible penalties relating to the tax year  and would have to reflect on its current period income statement the amount by which actual payments exceed its tax reserve for such a contingency 
this outcome could add as much as  to our tax provision if this occurs in some items of income and expense are recognized in different years for tax purposes than when applying generally accepted accounting principles  leading to timing differences between the company s actual tax liability and the amount accrued for this liability based on book income 
these temporary differences comprise the deferred portion of the company s tax expense  which is accumulated on the company s books as a deferred tax asset or deferred tax liability until such time as it reverses 
most of the company s temporary differences involve recognizing more expenses in its financial statements than it has been allowed to deduct for taxes  and therefore the company s deferred tax asset typically exceeds its deferred tax liability 
at december  the company s million net deferred tax asset was primarily due to temporary differences in the reported allowance for loan losses  deferred compensation  and depreciation 
the company s income tax expense is also affected by income earned on tax exempt securities 
these securities are primarily the company s investments in state  county and municipal bonds  which averaged of the total investment portfolio in and in  and provided million in federal tax exempt income in and million in although not reflected in the investment portfolio  in the company committed million to an investment in wnc institutional tax credit fund x  a low income housing partnership  which should result in about million in net total tax credits over its expected year life 
this is in addition to a million investment in a like fund in  which should generate million in net total tax credits  and a million investment in  which is expected to result in million in net total tax credits 
about  of those credits should apply to the tax year  while  of the tax credits were realized in in  it is expected that approximately  of these tax credits will be utilized 
all of the credits  however  are dependent upon the occupancy level of the housing projects and income of the tenants and cannot be projected with complete certainty 
in addition  in early the company reevaluated the interest income earned on its loans to companies whose operations are located in areas designated as enterprise zones by the state of california 
this interest income is partially exempt from california income taxes  and in the company recognized  in total refunds of prior year taxes based on amended returns filed with the california franchise tax board 
these refunds were received by the company  with interest  in late 
table of contents financial condition a comparison between the summary year end balance sheets for through was presented previously in the table of selected financial data see item above 
as indicated in that table  the company s total assets  loans  and shareholders equity have grown each year for the past four years 
prior to  asset growth was most pronounced in as a result of the acquisition of snb 
however  the company experienced growth in total assets in of over million  or  as compared to growth in of million  or  and growth in of million  or 
total assets were million and million at december  and  respectively 
a positive trend is also seen in the increase in loans relative to total earning assets every year since  which has contributed to the company s relatively strong net interest margin 
on the liability side  an increase in non interest bearing deposits relative to total liabilities from the end of to the end of also had a positive effect on the company s net interest margin 
marketing and customer service efforts are currently focused on maintaining or improving the ratio of demand deposits to total liabilities in an effort to sustain this impact  although no assurance can be given that this will occur 
the other assets category  which is comprised mainly of accrued interest receivable  deferred taxes  prepaid items  and other investments including the net cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance policies  has also consistently increased over the past few years 
the million  or increase in was mainly due to an additional million low income housing tax credit fund commitment 
the rather large million  or increase during was due to the company s million investment in boli plus another million low income housing tax credit fund investment 
loan and lease portfolio the company s loan and lease portfolio represents the single largest portion of invested assets  substantially greater than the investment portfolio or any other asset category  and the quality and diversification of the loan and lease portfolio are important considerations when reviewing the company s financial condition 
at december   gross loans and leases represented of total assets  compared to and at december  and  respectively 
management expects that the company s ratio of loans and leases to assets will average between and during  although the ratio also depends upon the relative growth of investments and non earning assets and could be higher or lower 
the ratio of loans and leases to deposits also increased to at the end of from at the end of the selected financial data table in item above reflects the amount of loans and leases  net of deferred fees and origination costs  outstanding at december st for each year from through the loan and lease distribution table that follows sets forth the amount of the company s total loans and leases outstanding and the percentage distribution in each category at the dates indicated

the company s branches and other business units generated the bulk of that growth  although about million in net growth in was from commercial real estate loan participations purchased and about half of the company s total million loan growth during was due to the acquisition of snb 
the most significant shift in the loan portfolio mix over the past five years has been toward real estate loans secured by commercial properties  which increased from of total loans at the end of to of total loans at the end of the company s commercial loans are targeted for the largest percentage growth in however  from a pure volume standpoint  commercial real estate is still an important part of the company s lending focus and is likely to remain so for the immediate future 
demand for loans is strong in some markets within the company s service area  despite apparent weak demand elsewhere in california and in the united states 
in view of that fact competition has intensified locally  especially in the fresno and bakersfield markets 
the company intends to address increased competition with its addition of leasing options and possible further expansion of loan products 
more extensive loan oriented marketing has also been planned 
overall  loan demand in the company s immediate market has been weighted toward loans secured by real estate  including commercial and professional buildings and single family dwellings  as well as commercial loans  including sba loans 
as a result  these areas have comprised the major portion of the company s loan growth over the past few years

however  loans secured by farmland increased by larger percentage  going up by million  or commercial loans  including sba loans  grew by million  or  during the company s commercial loans are centered in locally oriented commercial activities in markets where the company has a physical presence 
additionally  the company has a business unit dedicated to its sba product and is very active in specific sba program lending 
further  the company is designated as an sba preferred lender  which allows greater flexibility to meet small business loan requests with a more timely credit approval process 
in the past the company has sold some of its sba loans  and while we still have the ability to do so  our intention for the immediate future is to retain the sba loans we originate 
the company s dedication to sba lending was recently reaffirmed when bank of the sierra was named third in the sba s fresno california district for the dollar volume of sba loans  and fourth for the number of sba loans 
further  bank of the sierra is a participant in the sba s innovative community express program  and was fifth in the nation from through for the volume of loans produced under that program  behind the likes of banks such as wells fargo  bank one  and jp morgan 
the consumer loans category represented of total loans and leases at december  and of total loans and leases outstanding at december  these loans increased slightly  by million or  during these balances consist primarily of automobile loans and unsecured lines of credit  which have gained popularity due to their ease of use 
this relatively small increase is due in part to the fact that the company has encountered a great deal of competition for consumer lending products  but is also because home equity lines  other revolving consumer credit facilities and credit card lines  which are all reflected in other loan categories  are playing an increasingly important role in the company s consumer lending activities 
in fact  a total of million of the company s loans to individuals at the end of are in the form of home equity loans  which allow more favorable tax treatment of interest payments 
these home equity loans  which are captured within the total reported for real estate loans secured by residential properties  increased by million  or during agricultural loans remained at  about the same percentage of the company s total loan and lease balances at the end of as at the end of however  this is down from at the end of the decline in the relative level of agricultural loans over the past few years has been due in part to reduced local plantings in response to foreign competition 
however  the company has also withdrawn from financing production lines  where year to year cash flow variations can impede the ability of borrowers to meet contractual repayment terms 
with uncertain commodity prices some of our borrowers have experienced declining equity in farming operations  and many are selling farm land for alternate uses such as housing and commercial development 
credit card loans represented just of total loans and leases outstanding at december   having declined from of total loans and leases at december  despite this decrease  the credit card segment of the company s loan product group remains an important part of the company s relationship oriented retail lending strategy 
another important aspect of the company s loan business has been that of residential real estate loans which  up until march of  were generated internally by the real estate mortgage loan department and ultimately sold in the secondary market to government sponsored enterprises or other long term lenders 
the company originated and sold aggregate balances of approximately million of such loans during this changed in march  when the company ceased originating and selling those loans itself  and began collecting referral fees for directing most of its residential mortgage customers to moneyline 
from march through december  the company referred a total of million in successfully completed mortgage loans to moneyline  with the volume of referrals increasing to million in the company also originates and sells agricultural mortgage loans to certain other investors  and the volume of these loans serviced totaled million as of december  total loans serviced for others numbered with an aggregate balance of million as of the end of  as compared to loans with an aggregate balance of million at the end of and loans with an aggregate balance of million at december 
table of contents the company is not involved with chemicals or toxins that might have an adverse effect on the environment  thus its primary exposure to environmental legislation is through its lending activities 
the company s lending procedures include steps to identify and monitor this exposure to in an effort to avoid any related loss or liability 
loan and lease maturities the following maturity table shows the amounts of total loans and leases outstanding as of december   including non accruing loans 
the maturity distribution is based on remaining scheduled principal payments that are due within three months  after three months but less than one year  after one but within five years  or after five years 
the principal balance of loans due after one year is indicated by both fixed and floating rate categories 
loan and lease maturity dollars in thousands as of december  three months or less three months to twelve months one to five years over five years total floating rate due after one year fixed rate due after one year agricultural commercial and industrial real estate consumer loans credit cards leases total includes small business administration loans this schedule can be used in combination with the investment maturities table in the investment securities section and the deposit maturities table in the deposits section to identify time periods with potential liquidity exposure 
the referenced maturity schedules do not convey a complete picture of the company s re pricing exposure or interest rate risk  however 
for details on the re pricing characteristics of the company s balance sheet and a more comprehensive discussion of the company s sensitivity to changes in interest rates  see the liquidity and market risk section 
off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business  the company makes commitments to extend credit to its customers as long as there are no violations of any conditions established in contractual arrangements 
these commitments are obligations that represent a potential credit risk to the company  yet are not reflected in any form within the company s consolidated balance sheets 
total unused commitments to extend credit were million at december  as compared to million at december  net of credit card lines available which were million and million at december  and  unused commitments represented and of outstanding gross loans and leases at december  and  respectively 
the company s stand by letters of credit at december  and were million and million  respectively 
the effect on the company s revenues  expenses  cash flows and liquidity from the unused portion of the commitments to provide credit cannot be reasonably predicted  because there is no certainty that the lines of credit will ever be fully utilized 
for more information regarding the company s off balance sheet arrangements  see note to the financial statements located elsewhere herein 

table of contents contractual obligations as of december   the company had contractual obligations for the following payments  by type and period due payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term obligations total non performing assets financial institutions generally have a certain level of exposure to asset quality risk  and could potentially receive less than a full return of principal and interest if a debtor becomes unable or unwilling to repay 
since loans are the most significant assets of the company and generate the largest portion of its revenues  the company s management of asset quality risk is focused primarily on loan quality 
banks have generally suffered their most severe earnings declines as a result of customers inability to generate sufficient cash flow to service their debts  or as a result of the downturns in national and regional economies which have brought about declines in overall property values 
in addition  certain debt securities that the company may purchase have the potential of becoming less valuable if the obligor s financial capacity to repay deteriorates  and the company s equity investments could fall in value 
to help minimize credit quality concerns  the company has established a sound approach to credit that includes well defined goals and objectives and well documented credit policies and procedures 
the policies and procedures identify market segments  set goals for portfolio growth or contraction  and establish limits on industry and geographic credit concentrations 
in addition  these policies establish the company s underwriting standards and the methods of monitoring ongoing credit quality 
the company s internal credit risk controls are centered in underwriting practices  credit granting procedures  training  risk management techniques  and familiarity with loan and lease customers as well as the relative diversity and geographic concentration of our loan and lease portfolio 
unfortunately  the company s credit risk may also be affected by external factors such as the level of interest rates  employment  general economic conditions  real estate values  and trends in particular industries or geographic markets 
as a multi community independent bank serving a specific geographic area  the company must contend with the unpredictable changes of the california and san joaquin valley markets 
the company s asset quality has suffered in the past from the impact of national and regional economic recessions  consumer bankruptcies  weather related agricultural loan losses  and depressed prices for agricultural goods 
the san joaquin valley  however  currently appears poised for commercial and residential growth even as the agricultural industry remains weak 
major companies are discovering the san joaquin valley as an ideal location for distribution facilities  jobs are growing at a relatively fast rate  and comparatively low cost housing has attracted new residents from the more expensive regions of california 
the company is optimistic that the local economy will continue to improve  but no assurance can be given that such improvement will in fact occur 
non performing assets are comprised of the following loans and leases for which the company is no longer accruing interest  loans and leases days or more past due and still accruing interest although they are generally placed on non accrual when they become days past due  loans and leases restructured where the terms of repayment have been renegotiated  resulting in a deferral of interest or principal  and other real estate owned oreo 
management s classification of a loan or lease as non accrual is an indication that there is reasonable doubt as to the full recovery of principal or interest on the loan or lease 
at that point  the company stops accruing income from the interest  reverses any uncollected interest that had been accrued but unpaid  and recognizes interest income only as cash interest payments are received and as long as the collection of all outstanding principal is not in doubt 
the loans may or may not be collateralized  and collection efforts are continuously pursued 
loans or leases may be restructured by management when a borrower has experienced some change in financial status causing an inability to meet the original repayment terms and where the company believes the borrower will eventually overcome those circumstances and make full restitution 
oreo consists of properties acquired by foreclosure or similar means that management intends to offer for sale 
the following table provides information with respect to components of the company s non performing assets at the dates indicated 

table of contents non performing assets dollars in thousands as of december  nonaccrual loans and leases agricultural commercial and industrial real estate secured by commercial professional office properties including construction and development secured by residential properties secured by farmland total real estate small business administration loans consumer loans credit cards subtotal loans and leases days or more past due still accruing as to principal or interest agricultural commercial and industrial real estate secured by commercial professional office properties including construction and development secured by residential properties secured by farmland total real estate small business administration loans consumer loans credit cards subtotal total non performing loans and leases other real estate owned total nonperforming assets restructured loans and leases n a n a n a n a n a nonperforming loans and leases as of total gross loans and leases nonperforming assets as a of total gross loans and leases and other real estate owned additional interest income of approximately  would have been recorded for the year ended december  if these loans had been paid in accordance with their original terms and had been outstanding throughout the applicable period then ended or  if not outstanding throughout the applicable period then ended  since origination 
a restructured loan or lease is one where the terms were renegotiated to provide a reduction or deferral of interest or principal because of a deterioration in the financial position of the borrower 
total non performing balances stood at million at the end of  with over of those balances being agriculture related 
the non performing agriculture loans and oreo stem from issues in our agriculture credit department prior to its reorganization in at that time  an experienced agriculture lender manager was hired to 
table of contents monitor problems that were becoming apparent  implement tighter controls  and establish more effective underwriting criteria 
with that accomplished  we are now cautiously expanding the agricultural loan portfolio with loans to creditworthy borrowers  although no assurance can be given that all of those borrowers will continue to pay principal and interest in a timely manner 
the balance of non performing assets at the end of represents an increase of million  or  from year end levels 
non performing assets to total gross loans plus oreo increased only slightly  however  to at the end of from at the end of  and non performing loans as a percentage of total loans and leases fell to from 
the main changes in non performing assets during were the transfer of million in commercial loans that were over days past due but still accruing as of the end of to non accrual status  and a million increase in oreo 
the oreo increase was due to the company s foreclosure on buildings and equipment securing a million commercial loan 
we are optimistic that the current fair market value of the property is sufficient to ensure a full recovery  however the ultimate amount recovered could differ substantially 
although non performing balances increased in  the company s non performing assets were lower at december  than at the end of by million  or  due in part to the favorable resolution of certain problem credits 
however  much of the decline was simply the result of the level of net loan balances charged off  which increased by million in due to a more proactive approach to identifying and aggressively charging off loans when losses appear imminent see allowance for loan losses 
the company s non performing assets increased by million during  primarily as the result of the transfer of million in loans to a single borrower to non accrual status 
approximately million of that balance has been collected and  has been charged off  thus the remaining balance on those loans was about million as of the end of a mitigating factor when evaluating the company s non performing loans is that million  or  of the total million balance at year end is secured by real estate 
an additional million  or  is comprised of the guaranteed portion of loans that are backed by the us government 
the company expects to maintain or reduce its non performing loans as a percentage of total gross loans and leases  however an increase in the dollar amount of non accrual loans and leases is possible as we expand our lending activities 
we also expect occasional foreclosures as a last resort in the resolution of some problem credits 
allowance for loan and lease losses the allowance for loan and lease losses is established through a provision for losses based on management s evaluation of known and inherent risks in the company s loan and lease portfolio 
the allowance is increased by provisions charged against current earnings  and reduced by net charge offs 
loans and leases are charged off when they are deemed to be uncollectible  while recoveries are generally recorded only when cash payments are received subsequent to the charge off 
we employ a systematic methodology for determining the allowance for loan and lease losses that includes a periodic review process and adjustment of the allowance at least quarterly 
our process includes a review of individual loans and leases that have been specifically identified as problems or have characteristics that could lead to impairment  as well as detailed reviews of other loans and leases either individually or in pools 
our methodology incorporates a variety of risk considerations  both quantitative and qualitative  in establishing an allowance for losses that management believes is appropriate at each reporting date 
quantitative factors include our historical loss experience  delinquency and charge off trends  collateral values  changes in non performing loans and leases  and other factors 
quantitative factors also incorporate known information about individual loans and leases  including borrowers sensitivity to interest rate movements and to other quantifiable external factors  such as commodity price changes and acts of nature freezes  earthquakes  fires  etc  that occur in a particular period 
qualitative factors are at least to some extent based on management s judgment and experience 
they include an assessment of the general economic environment in our markets and  in particular  the state of agriculture and other key industries in the central san joaquin valley 
the way a particular loan or lease might be structured  the extent and nature of waivers of existing loan policies  the results of bank regulatory examinations  model imprecision  and 
table of contents the expected rate of portfolio growth are additional factors that are considered 
the table which follows summarizes the activity in the allowance for loan and lease losses for the years indicated allowance for loan losses and leases dollars in thousands as of december  balances average gross loans and leases outstanding during period gross loans and leases outstanding at end of period allowance for loan and lease losses balance at beginning of period adjustments provision charged to expense charge offs agricultural commercial industrial loans real estate loans consumer loans leases credit card loans total recoveries agricultural commercial industrial loans real estate loans consumer loans leases credit card loans total net loan and lease charge offs balance at end of period ratios net loan and lease charge offs to average loans and leases allowance for loan and lease losses to gross loans and leases at end of period allowance for loan and lease losses to non performing loans and leases net loan and lease charge offs to allowance for loan and lease losses at end of period net loan and lease charge offs to provision for loan and lease losses allowance acquired from sierra national bank includes small business administration loans 
the company s allowance for loan and lease losses increased by  during and ended the year at million 
the loss provision in totaled million  compared to million in although the provision was  lower in than in  net loans charged off were also  lower 
net loan charge offs in were million  or of average loans and leases  compared to million  or 
in while commercial loan charge offs increased slightly in  charge offs declined for agricultural loans and consumer 
table of contents loans 
the decrease in consumer loan charge offs was mainly because charge offs were unusually high  due to certain unsecured lines of credit that were purchased by the company in late and charged off in specifically  some of the lines were to technology sector executives who became unable to meet contractual repayment terms subsequent to the purchase 
the agricultural charge off in represents balances that were placed on non accrual in and were ultimately deemed to be uncollectible 
the allowance as a percentage of total loans and leases at year end declined to versus at the end of this drop was mainly due to the extraordinary growth in real estate secured loan balances  which have lower historical loss ratios and thus have a smaller reserve percentage applied against them 
because non performing balances actually increased at a much lower rate that the loan portfolio as a whole  however  the allowance for loan and lease losses increased as a percentage of non performing loans 
that ratio was at the end of  versus at the end of our methodology for determining the adequacy of the company s allowance for loan and lease losses is  and has been  consistently followed 
however  as we add new products  increase in complexity  and expand our geographic coverage  we expect to enhance our methodology to keep pace with the size and complexity of the loan and lease portfolio 
on an ongoing basis we engage outside firms to independently assess our methodology  and to perform independent credit reviews of our loan and lease portfolio 
the company s external auditors  the fdic  and the california department of financial institutions also review the allowance for loan and lease losses as an integral part of the examination processes 
management believes that the current methodology is appropriate given our size and level of complexity 
further  management believes that the allowance for loan and lease losses is adequate as of december  to cover known and inherent risks in the portfolio 
fluctuations in credit quality  changes in economic conditions  or other factors could induce us to augment the allowance  however  and no assurance can be given that such factors will not result in increased losses in the loan and lease portfolio in the future 
the following table provides a summary of the allocation of the allowance for loan and lease losses for specific categories at the dates indicated 
the allocation presented should not be interpreted as an indication that charges to the allowance for loan and lease losses will be incurred in these amounts or proportions  or that the portion of the allowance allocated to each category represents the total amounts available for charge offs that may occur within these categories

investment portfolio the investment securities portfolio had a book value of million at december   compared to million at the end of it is the second largest component of the company s interest earning assets  and the structure and composition of this portfolio is important to any analysis of the financial condition of the company 
the investment portfolio serves the following purposes it provides liquidity to even out cash flows from the loan and deposit activities of customers  it provides a source of pledged assets for securing public deposits and borrowed funds  it provides a large base of assets  the maturity and interest rate characteristics of which can be changed more readily 
table of contents than the loan portfolio to better match changes in the deposit base and other funding sources of the company  it is an alternative interest earning use of funds when loan demand is weak  and it can enhance the company s tax position by providing partially tax exempt income 
the company uses two portfolio classifications for its investments held to maturity  and available for sale 
accounting rules also allow for a trading portfolio classification  but the company has no investments that would be classified as such 
the held to maturity portfolio can consist only of investments that the company has both the intention and ability to hold until maturity  to be sold only in the event of concerns with an issuer s credit worthiness  a change in tax law that eliminates their tax exempt status or other infrequent situations as permitted by generally accepted accounting principles 
since the company does not have a trading portfolio  the available for sale portfolio is comprised of all securities not included as held to maturity 
prior to  the company s long term tax exempt obligations and certain pledged treasury and agency issues were classified as held to maturity 
during the fourth quarter of  however  the company adopted financial accounting standards board statement  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  which afforded the opportunity to reclassify some or all of our investments 
upon adoption of this statement  the company reclassified all of its marketable investments from the held to maturity portfolio to the available for sale portfolio to allow more flexibility with regard to the active management of its investment securities 
sfas requires available for sale securities to be marked to market on a periodic basis with an offset to accumulated other comprehensive income  a component of equity 
thus  an adjustment to reflect the accounting differences between held to maturity and available for sale securities was made at the time of the reclassification 
because the market value was higher than the amortized cost  the difference was recorded on the balance sheet as an increase in accumulated other comprehensive income  net of the tax effect 
since then  monthly adjustments have been made to reflect changes in the market value of the company s available for sale securities 
the company s investment portfolio is currently composed primarily of us treasury and agency issues for liquidity and pledging  mortgage backed securities  which in many instances can also be used for pledging  and which generally enhance the yield of the portfolio  state  county and municipal obligations  which provide limited tax free income and pledging potential  and other equity investments 
the fourth category includes an equity investment in farmer mac stock  which is a required element to allow the company to sell certain agricultural loans to this quasi governmental agency 
continuing the trends started in  the relative distribution of these groups within the overall portfolio changed in in  us treasury and agency bonds declined to of the portfolio from in  and municipal bonds fell to of the total portfolio from in most of the decline in municipal securities was from bonds that were called prior to maturity 
the company was not inclined to replace these with similar investments due to the relatively long duration and low yields of currently available bonds 
the growth in the portfolio came in mortgage backed securities  which increased to of the total in from in as maturing bonds were replaced with relatively short duration  higher yielding mortgage backed securities 
still  as can be seen on the distribution  rate yield table presented in a previous section  the average tax equivalent yield earned on total investments declined to in from in unless interest rates rise substantially  the portfolio yield is likely to continue declining as high yielding assets mature or are called and are replaced by instruments with current market yields 
the following investment portfolio table reflects the amortized cost and fair market values for the total portfolio for each of the categories of investments for the past three years 

table of contents investment portfolio available for sale dollars in thousands as of december  amortized cost fair market value amortized cost fair market value amortized cost fair market value us treasury securities us government agencies corporations mortgage backed securities cmo corporate bonds state political subdivisions equity securities total investment securities while the carrying value of the company s investment portfolio increased slightly in  it declined by million during  falling to million from million at the end of the previous year 
while this would normally have undesirable liquidity implications  the company has enhanced its liquidity resources by expanding overnight fed funds borrowing lines  adding access to multiple brokered cd programs  and increasing its investment in bank owned life insurance 
the reduction in investment portfolio balances in added to the positive impact of rising loan balances on the company s net interest margin  when viewing both categories relative to interest earning assets 
while loans are generally higher yielding instruments and their increased weighting enhances the company s yield on earning assets  management does not anticipate letting investment balances drop further relative to total earning assets due to the investment portfolio s preferential liquidity and risk characteristics 
securities pledged as collateral for repurchase agreements  public deposits and for other purposes as required or permitted by law were million and million at december  and  respectively 
the investment maturities table below summarizes contractual maturities for the company s investment securities and their weighted average yields at december  the actual timing of principal payments may differ from remaining contractual maturities  because obligors may have the right to repay certain obligations with or without penalties

cash and due from banks cash on hand and balances due from correspondent banks totaled million at the end of and represent the major portion of the company s non earning assets 
at december   cash and due from banks comprised of total assets  compared to at december  because these balances fluctuate frequently and by 
table of contents large amounts depending on the status of cash items in process of collection and cash on hand  period end balances are not optimal indicators of trends in cash and due from banks  annual average balances provide a much more appropriate gauge 
the average balance for was million  a slight increase from the average for of million as the result of a higher level of currency and coin kept on hand for certain currency intensive customers 
in general  due from bank balances  including balances at the federal reserve bank  have been greater for the company than for similar size institutions in metropolitan areas where collection activity is more centralized 
however  when federal reserve banks begin accepting electronic items ie  imaged checks for collection  this geographic disadvantage could dissipate 
premises and equipment premises and equipment are stated at cost  less accumulated depreciation and amortization 
depreciation is charged to income over the estimated useful lives of the assets and leasehold improvements are amortized over the terms of the related lease  or the estimated useful lives of the improvements  whichever is shorter 
depreciation and amortization was million for the year ended december  as compared to million during the following premises and equipment table reflects the balances by major category of fixed assets premises equipment dollars in thousands as of december  cost accumulated depr and amort net book value cost accumulated depr and amort net book value cost accumulated depr and amort net book value land buildings leasehold improvements construction in progress furniture and equipment total the net book value of the company s premises and equipment increased by  in  due mainly to the new fresno branch and the addition of equipment leased to customers under operating leases 
in the total book value increased by million  or  due to the equipment purchased to facilitate in house item processing  a comprehensive replacement of desktop workstations  the upgrade of many of the company s network servers  and other technology initiatives undertaken that year 
the net book value of the company s aggregate premises and equipment was of total assets at december   at december   and at the end of other assets other assets increased by million  or  during  and were about of total assets at the end of and this increase is largely the result of an additional million commitment to invest in low income housing tax credit funds made in july of low income housing tax credit funds lower the company s tax liability through direct tax credits as well as partnership operating losses 
pass through partnership losses from tax credit funds are charged against the company s investment in such funds  thus the investment has been written down from its original total of million to million at december  even taking losses into consideration and assuming no gain upon disposition  the estimated tax equivalent return on these investments over the expected year life is around 
the other assets category also includes the company s aggregate million investment in boli  which increased by million during due to growth in its net cash surrender value 
boli  or bank owned life insurance  is an insurance policy with a single premium paid at policy commencement 
its initial net cash surrender value is equivalent to the premium paid  and it adds income through non taxable increases in its cash surrender value  net of the cost of insurance  plus any death benefits ultimately received by the company 
the costs of certain benefit plans added by the company in are funded with boli income  but even net of the accruals for expected expenses associated with these benefit plans the boli is projected to have a tax equivalent return of around 
no assurance can be given that this return will be fully realized  though 

table of contents the company holds certain other equity investments that are not readily marketable securities and thus are classified as other assets on the company s balance sheet 
these include investments in pacific coast bankers bancshares  diversified holding corporation dhc  california economic development lending initiative  and the federal home loan bank fhlb 
the largest of these investments is the company s million investment in fhlb stock 
this investment fluctuates from time to time based on the company s current and recent borrowing activity at the federal home loan bank 
the only other significant investment in this category is the company s million investment in dhc that was made during dhc is owned primarily by a consortium of california bank holding companies  none of which holds voting shares in excess of of the total voting stock of dhc 
dhc is a holding company for certain title insurance companies which operate mainly in california and which derive a portion of their revenues out of referrals from the banks that own dhc

deposits information concerning the average balance and average rates paid on deposits by deposit type for the past three fiscal years is contained in the distribution  rate  and yield table located in the previous section on results of operations net interest income and net interest margin 
the composition and cost of the company s deposit base are important components in analyzing the company s net interest margin and balance sheet liquidity characteristics  both of which are discussed in greater detail in other sections herein 
our net interest margin is improved to the extent that growth in deposits can be concentrated in historically lower cost deposits such as non interest bearing demand  now accounts  savings accounts and money market deposit accounts 
the company s liquidity is impacted by the volatility of deposits or other funding instruments  or in other words by the propensity of that money to leave the institution for rate related or other reasons 
potentially  the most volatile deposits in a financial institution are jumbo certificates of deposits  meaning time deposits with balances that equal or exceed  as customers with balances of that magnitude are typically more rate sensitive than customers with smaller balances 
the company s community oriented deposit gathering activities  however  seem to have engendered a base of local customers who tend to display more brand loyalty and thus are less likely to leave the company than might otherwise be expected 
the company s total deposits grew by million  or during  and by million  or during federal home loan bank borrowings were replaced by brokered cd s early in  which provided approximately million of the increase in deposit balances from the end of to the end of brokered cd s increased by another million during to their ending balance of million  while core deposits  which include all other deposits except customer time deposits issued in denominations of  or more  increased by over million for the year 
the average balance per core deposit account increased slightly  to  at the end of from  at the end of  however most of the increase in total balances was due to an increase in the number of accounts 
core deposit accounts increased by over  in number  or in the increase in customers and accounts was generated by marketing campaigns specifically targeting retail deposit products  and by more intense cross selling efforts in the company s branches 
non brokered cd s of  or more experienced minimal growth of about million  or in we are focused on sustaining the momentum in core customer deposit growth in order to let brokered deposits roll off as they mature  although no assurance can be given that the company will achieve this objective 
a favorable volume shift among deposits is particularly evident in non interest demand deposits  which increased to of total deposits plus interest bearing liabilities at december  from at the end of december these deposits increased by million  or in  and by million  or  in likewise  regular savings accounts increased by million  or in  a substantially higher rate of increase than the overall increase for total deposits 

table of contents the scheduled maturity distribution of the company s time deposits as of december  was as follows deposit maturity distribution dollars in thousands as of december  three months or less three to six months six to twelve months one to three years over three years total time certificates of deposits  other time deposits  total in addition to deposit liabilities obtained in its local markets  the company provides a cash management product to its commercial business customers 
this product group is categorized as a non deposit sweep account  and the company s december  financial statements include million in repurchase agreements that represent such sweep accounts see other borrowings section which follows 
at december   the company s financial statements reflected approximately million in repurchase agreements  secured by pledged investments held segregated from the company s own securities portfolio 
due to their short term overnight nature  the cost of these sweep accounts has generally been lower than the company s interest rates for longer term funds 
it is anticipated that this product will remain an important aspect of the company s service capacity 
other borrowings the company utilizes other short term borrowing to temporarily fund loan growth when customer deposit growth has not kept pace with increases in outstanding loan balances 
in addition  short term borrowings may be used to purchase additional investments  or when additional liquidity is required to support higher customer cash utilization 
short term borrowings principally include overnight fed funds purchased  overnight advances from the federal home loan bank of san francisco fhlb  and securities sold under repurchase agreements which were described more fully in the previous section 
the details of these borrowings for the years   and are presented below short term borrowings repurchase agreements dollars in thousands balance at december average amount outstanding maximum amount outstanding at any month end average interest rate for the year fed funds purchased and overnight fhlb advances dollars in thousands balance at december average amount outstanding maximum amount outstanding at any month end average interest rate for the year

total shareholders equity at the end of was million 
net income has provided over million in capital over the last three years  of which million or approximately was distributed in dividends 
the retention of earnings has been the company s main source of capital since the company did  however  issue million in trust preferred securities in through its unconsolidated wholly owned subsidiary  sierra capital trust i 
the proceeds of this issuance are considered to be tier capital for regulatory purposes but long term debt in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
however  no assurance can be given that trust preferred securities will continue to be treated as tier capital in the future 
the company paid cash dividends totaling million or 
per share in  and million or per share in  representing of the prior year s earnings for both years 
the company anticipates paying future dividends of around of the prior year s net earnings  however no assurance can be given that earnings and or growth expectations in any given year will justify the payment of such a dividend 
the company uses a variety of measures to evaluate capital adequacy 
management reviews various capital measurements on a monthly basis and takes appropriate action to ensure that such measurements are within established internal and external guidelines 
the external guidelines  which are issued by the federal reserve board and the fdic  establish a risk adjusted ratio relating capital to different categories of assets and off balance sheet exposures 
there are two categories of capital under the federal reserve board and fdic guidelines tier and tier capital 
tier capital currently includes common shareholders equity and the proceeds from the issuance of trust preferred securities trust preferred securities are counted only up to a maximum of of tier capital  less goodwill and certain other deductions  notably the unrealized net gains or losses after tax adjustments on securities available for sale  which are carried at fair market value 
tier capital includes preferred stock and certain types of debt equity which the company does not hold  as well as the allowance for loan losses  subject to certain limitations

as of the end of  both the company and the bank were considered to be well capitalized by regulatory standards 
we do not foresee any circumstances that would cause the either the company or the bank to be less than well capitalized  although no assurance can be given that this will not occur 
liquidity and market risk management liquidity liquidity refers to the company s ability to maintain cash flows sufficient to fund operations  and to meet obligations and other commitments in a timely and cost effective fashion 
at various times the company requires funds to meet short term cash requirements brought about by loan growth or deposit outflows  the purchase of assets  or liability repayments 
to manage liquidity needs properly  cash inflows must be timed to coincide with anticipated outflows  or sufficient liquidity resources must be available to meet varying demands 
the company manages liquidity in such a fashion as to be able to meet unexpected sudden changes in levels of its assets or deposit liabilities without maintaining excessive amounts of on balance sheet liquidity 
excess balance sheet liquidity can negatively impact the interest margin 
an integral part of the company s ability to manage its liquidity position appropriately is the company s large base of core deposits  which are generated by offering traditional banking services in the communities in its service area and which have  historically  been a very stable source of funds 
in addition to core deposits  the company has the 
table of contents ability to raise deposits through various deposit brokers if required for liquidity purposes 
the company s loan to deposit ratio increased to at december   from at the end of the numerator of this ratio was impacted by the rapid growth in loans relative to investment securities  and the denominator was affected by the disproportionate increase in overnight borrowings needed to fund that growth 
the ratio declined in relative to year end subsequent to the replacement of overnight borrowings with deposits  and it is anticipated that the short term borrowings reflected on the company s balance sheet at the end of will also decline as core deposit growth catches up to loan growth 
the unpledged portion of the company s investment portfolio is also an integral component of liquidity management due to the relative ease with which many bonds can be sold 
despite the relatively weak growth in investment balances during the year  there were still million in unpledged marketable investments at the end of that could be sold  if necessary 
management is of the opinion that its investments and the other standby funding sources it has arranged are more than sufficient to meet the company s current and anticipated short term liquidity needs 
those additional sources include the following a formal borrowing line with the federal home loan bank that is secured by certain of the company s real estate loans  informal short term liquidity lines for overnight fed funds with certain correspondent banks  readily marketable loans  including the guaranteed portion of sba loans  and the net cash surrender value of boli 
interest rate risk management market risk arises from changes in interest rates  exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
the company s market risk exposure is primarily that of interest rate risk  and it has risk management policies to monitor and limit earnings and balance sheet exposure to changes in interest rates 
the company does not engage in the trading of financial instruments 
the principal objective of interest rate risk management often referred to as asset liability management is to manage the financial components of the company in a manner that will optimize the risk reward equation for earnings and capital in relation to changing interest rates 
in order to identify areas of potential exposure to rate changes  the company performs an earnings simulation analysis and a market value of portfolio equity calculation on at least a quarterly basis to identify more dynamic interest rate risk exposures than those apparent in a standard re pricing gap analysis 
third party modeling software is used by the company for asset liability management in order to simulate the effects of potential interest rate changes on its net interest margin 
these simulations can also provide information on the projected fair market values of the company s financial instruments under different interest rate scenarios 
the software utilizes detailed information on loan and deposit maturities  embedded options  rates  and re pricing characteristics to determine the effects of a given interest rate change on the company s interest income and interest expense 
rate scenarios consisting of key rate and yield curve projections are run against the company s investment  loan  deposit and borrowed funds portfolios 
these rate projections can be shocked an immediate and sustained change in rates  up or down  ramped an incremental increase or decrease in rates over a specified time period  economic based on current trends and econometric models or stable unchanged from current actual levels 
the company typically uses seven standard interest rate scenarios in conducting its simulations  namely stable  upward shocks of  and basis points  and downward shocks of   and basis points 
the company s policy is to limit the change in the company s net interest income for the next months to plus or minus based on a basis point bp shock  plus or minus based on a bp shock  and plus or minus based on a bp shock in interest rates 
as of december   the company had the following estimated net interest income sensitivity profile relative to a base case of stable rates immediate change in rate bp bp bp bp bp bp change in net int inc change 
table of contents the above profile illustrates that if there were an immediate downward adjustment of basis points in interest rates and the company did nothing further with regard to the active management of its assets or liabilities  net interest income during the next twelve months would probably be million  or lower than if rates had remained unchanged 
by the same token  if there were an immediate increase of basis points in interest rates  the company s net interest income would likely gain million  or  over the next year 
the company is slightly asset sensitive  meaning that all else being equal  net interest income is typically expected to progressively increase when rates are rising and go down in like proportions as rates fall 
in fact the company has  in the past  seen erosion in its interest margin when rates have declined and has benefited from rising rates 
the exposure to declining rates appears disproportionate in these simulations  however  because most of the company s deposit rates are currently so close to a natural floor of zero 
as rates on interest bearing liabilities hit this floor the company s yield on earning assets continues to fall  creating significant net interest margin compression 
even though management does not expect current historically low rates to fall further  if they did the company would likely limit movement in the bank of the sierra prime rate 
this was the case in late and  and with approximately million in variable rate loan balances pegged to that index the company s net interest margin was protected 
no assurance can be given that this would occur in the future should rates continue to decline 
however  if the bank of the sierra prime rate is not lowered further from its current level  the company s interest rate risk profile changes dramatically immediate change in rate bp bp bp bp bp bp change in net int inc change as shown  net interest income is actually enhanced in declining scenarios if a floor is maintained on the bank s prime rate 
in either case  increases in net interest income under the rising rate scenarios are also non symmetrical  with a slight dip in the up basis points simulation 
this is the result of incorporating into the model the assumption that if interest rates go up  the company will apply relatively lower increases to the bank of the sierra prime until it reaches parity with the industry standard wall street journal prime rate 
the economic values of the company s loan and deposit portfolios also change under the interest rate scenarios previously discussed 
the amount of change is based on the characteristics of each loan and deposit class  which include weighted average rates relative to current market  the likelihood of prepayment  whether the rate is fixed or floating  and the weighted average term remaining to maturity 
the quantification of the change in economic value is somewhat apparent in note  fair value of financial instruments  in the consolidated financial report  however  such values change over time based on changes in interest rates and the yield curve
