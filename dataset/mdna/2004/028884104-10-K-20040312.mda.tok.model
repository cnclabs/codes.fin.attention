overview of apcapital s operations we are a leading provider of medical professional liability insurance coverage  writing this coverage in states throughout the country 
this insurance coverage protects physicians and other health providers from claims filed against them for alleged acts of medical malpractice 
medical professional liability insurance represented of our direct premiums written in in addition  during  we wrote workers compensation insurance in states  insuring a variety of business classes 
during  we also participated in a health insurance program  writing small business employee health insurance through a single preferred provider organization located in western michigan 
in the fourth quarter of  the company began to implement plans to exit the workers compensation and health insurance lines of business 
in late and early  we received downgrades in our financial strength rating from am best 
these downgrades  and their potential impact on our business  are discussed more fully in item business am best company rating  which information is incorporated herein by reference 
the economics of property casualty insurance as a property and casualty insurer  our results of operations are primarily driven by our underwriting results  which are measured by subtracting incurred loss and loss adjustment expenses and underwriting expenses from net premiums earned 
while this measure is a key performance indicator of an insurance company s operations  it is not uncommon for a property and casualty insurance company to generate an underwriting loss  yet earn a profit overall  because of the availability of investment income to offset the underwriting loss 
an insurance company earns investment income on what is commonly referred to as the float 
the float is money that we hold  in the form of investments  from premiums that we have collected 
although most of these premiums will ultimately be used to make claim payments and to pay for claims adjustment expenses  the period of time that we hold the float prior to paying losses can extend over several years 
the key factors that determine the amount of investment income we are able to generate are the rate of return  or yield  on the float  and the amount of time we able to hold the float 
most of the insurance policies we write have a one year policy term 
the written premiums associated with policies we write are earned ratably over the year in which we provide insurance coverage 
this means that rate increases that we implement will not be fully earned for up to months as policyholders who renewed immediately prior to the rate increase will not be charged the higher rate for up to months  and then those premiums will take another months to be fully earned 
our loss experience is a major component of our results of operations 
when we receive notice of a claim that is covered under a policy we have issued  our claims adjusters establish a reserve for the expected cost to settle the claim  including estimates of any related legal or other expenses associated with resolving the claim 
these reserves are referred to as case basis reserves 
in addition  at the end of each reporting period  certain losses will have occurred that have not been reported to us 
accordingly  we establish reserves for such incurred but not reported ibnr losses and related loss adjustment expenses 
our incurred loss and loss adjustment expenses represent any payments made to settle losses  including related loss adjustment expense payments  as well as any change in our case basis and ibnr reserves 
paid and incurred losses give different pictures of our loss experience  and examining both can help provide a better understanding of our losses 
paid losses are the cash payments we make in a given year  irrespective of the year in which the claim giving rise to the payment occurred or was reported 
most payments made in a given year are for claims that were reported in previous years because of the extended amount of time required to resolve a claim through litigation or settlement 
incurred losses in any given year reflect our expectations of the amount that will ultimately be paid on claims reported in that year 
incurred losses in a single year  will also reflect any adjustment we make to the expected amounts that must be paid on claims reported during previous years  as well as any changes in our estimates for ibnr 
underwriting expenses represent costs associated with issuing new and renewal business as well as ongoing policy maintenance expenses 
some of these costs  such as commissions and premium taxes  as well as a portion of the salaries related to our underwriting staff  vary with and are primarily related to the production of new and renewal business 
these costs are deferred and amortized over the related period in which we earn the premiums associated with the business written 
other costs that do not vary with the production of new and renewal business are charged to income as incurred 
to ensure the security of our policyholders  we must maintain assets in excess of total liabilities 
this excess  or surplus  is the principal measure used by state insurance regulators  and rating agencies such as am best  to evaluate the company s financial strength 
medical professional liability insurers generally attempt to keep this surplus level approximately equal to their annual net premiums written 
the medical professional liability insurance market the medical professional liability insurance business  like all other property and casualty insurance markets  tends to cycle through what are often referred to as hard and soft markets 
a hard market is generally characterized as a period of rapidly rising premium rates  tightened underwriting standards  narrowed coverage  and the withdrawal of insurers from certain markets 
soft markets  are usually characterized by relatively flat or slow rising premium rates  less stringent underwriting standards  expanded coverage and strong competition among insurers 
in the mid to late s  the medical professional liability insurance industry was generally viewed as being in a soft market 
however  since approximately  the trend in medical professional liability insurance has been towards a harder market 
hard and soft market cycles tend to be more extreme in the medical professional liability business than in other insurance businesses because of the longer period of time required to resolve medical malpractice claims 
the rising cost of medical professional liability insurance has been prominent in the media in recent years 
several factors have contributed to the recent premium rate increases such as  an increase in paid losses  decreased investment income due to lower prevailing interest rates  reduced competition  and increased reinsurance rates 
the most significant factor contributing to the increase in medical professional liability premiums in recent years is the increase in paid losses 
to combat rising loss costs  we have initiated several actions including exiting unprofitable markets such as florida and nevada  ceased writing occurrence based policies in all markets with the exception of michigan  indiana and new mexico 
discontinued writing certain high risk specialties  implemented on site risk management assessments on all new business in ohio  kentucky and illinois  implemented a unique communication skills assessment in targeted markets  and reduced policy limits 
tort reform is another factor that affects our business 
tort reform encompasses a variety of subject matters  however  the one most critical to the medical professional liability insurance market is limits on non economic damages and punitive damages 
historically tort reform has occurred on a state by state basis 
accordingly  losses can vary dramatically by state depending on the level of tort reform the state has enacted 
we monitor state tort reform closely and evaluate any changes for impacts on our current business strategies and estimated loss reserves 
anticipated losses will generally be the primary determinant of premium rates 
we establish medical professional liability premium base rates for particular medical specialties within a given state and sometimes for a specific geographic region within a state 
we also offer discounts or add surcharges for particular policyholder characteristics  such as claims history or participation in any risk management programs 
our premium rates are based on anticipated losses on claims and related expenses  expected investment income  our surplus needs  and the desire to earn a reasonable profit for shareholders 
in most states  however  insurance regulators have the authority to approve or deny proposed premium rate changes 
medical professional liability insurance can be written on both a claims made and an occurrence basis 
claims made policies  which are the most common  cover claims reported during the year in which the policy is in effect 
occurrence based policies cover claims arising out of events that have occurred during the year in which the policy was in effect  regardless of when they are reported 
during the last three years  approximately of our medical professional liability direct premiums represented claims made policies  with the remainder representing occurrence based policies 
although we have discontinued writing occurrence based policies in certain states and markets  we have not seen an overall decrease in occurrence based premiums as a result of premium rate increases in new mexico  where we are required to write occurrence based policies by law  and in other states such as michigan 
accurately predicting losses on medical professional liability claims is difficult for several reasons 
first  most medical professional liability claims take several years to resolve 
this often lengthy resolution period reflects the time needed for the discovery of the medical malpractice  which is often not reported to the insured immediately  the filing of a claim  determining  through settlement or trial  the payment responsibilities  if any  associated with the claim  and the payment of the claim 
as a result  we often must estimate the ultimate cost to settle a claim  including related expenses  several years in advance of payment 
second  the range of the ultimate potential loss can vary significantly for individual claims with similar characteristics  making it difficult to predict the ultimate loss associated with any single claim 
third  the ultimate projected loss is based  in part  on actuarial methodologies using relevant historical data  which in some cases may be limited 
we review our estimates quarterly  and as facts and patterns emerge that provide us with more relevant information related to projection of ultimate expected loss costs  we adjust our estimates related to the liability for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses  with the change in estimates resulting in either an increase or decrease in incurred loss and loss adjustment expenses for the current period 
as with other types of property and casualty insurance  medical professional liability insurance policies are subject to policy limits 
the limits of liability purchased by our medical professional liability policyholders differ by state 
in michigan and new mexico  the most common limits purchased are  of coverage per claim and  of aggregate coverage per year 
in all other states in which we write business  the most common policy limits purchased are million million 
we may write higher limits and excess coverage in conjunction with special reinsurance arrangements 
important agency relationship the principal agency through which we write medical professional liability insurance is scw agency group  inc and its wholly owned subsidiaries 
scw is owned by william b 
cheeseman  one of our directors and our former president and chief executive officer 
bridget cheeseman  mr 
cheeseman s adult daughter  is a vice president of scw and owns approximately of scw 
during the three years ended december   mr 
cheeseman has received no cash or other compensation  dividends or other distributions from scw and his only benefit from scw from this relationship is the potential appreciation of his ownership interest in that company 
if scw increases the amount of business it writes for us  scw will earn more commission revenue from us 
to the extent the increase in commission revenue we pay scw increases scw s profits  mr 
cheeseman s ownership interest may appreciate 
scw has been a significant agent for us for many years 
the commission rates we have paid to scw have been either the same or less than the commission rates we paid to our other agents 
in addition  with limited exceptions  the only medical professional liability insurance sold by scw in michigan was written by the company 
we are not required to sell insurance solely through scw 
we believe these factors have created a more favorable agency relationship for us than we have with our other agents 
scw sells insurance written by several companies 
however  the commissions it receives on premiums it writes for the company typically account for to of its revenues 
direct premiums written for us by scw during  and totaled   and  respectively  representing  and of direct premiums written during such years 
commission expense we incurred related to scw approximated   and  in  and  respectively 
based on financial information made available to us  we estimate scw s net profits on the commission revenue earned from us in to be approximately million 
we have not attempted to independently audit or verify the information scw has furnished  although we have no reason to believe it is inaccurate 
for purposes of this disclosure  we have estimated the net profits that scw earned on the revenue received from us by calculating the profit percentage that scw s net profits bears to its total revenue in and applying that percentage to the revenue earned from us 
prior to mr 
cheeseman s retirement  there were various safeguards to protect the company from actual or potential conflicts of interest arising from this relationship 
mr 
cheeseman was prohibited from acting as a director  officer or employee of scw and  pursuant to company policy  did not participate in day to day discussions between the company and scw or in decisions about whether to underwrite business proposed to be written by scw prior to his retirement 
moreover  we applied and continue to apply the same underwriting rules to business written by scw as we apply to business written by other agencies 
these underwriting rules are generally filed with the regulatory agencies in the various states in which we do business and are established solely by the company in order to control the quality of business submitted by all agents  including scw 
we also monitor our loss experience on the business written by our agents  including scw 
since his retirement from apcapital  mr 
cheeseman has taken a more active role in the activities of scw 
in january  we completed a new year contract with scw 
the agreement provides for american physicians to be the exclusive medical professional liability carrier scw represents in the state of michigan  subject to limited exceptions  such as a further downgrade of our am best rating 
however  we continue to have the right to appoint other agents 
scw may continue to represent other insurance companies in other states 
the contract provides for scw to be paid commissions consistent with the marketplace 
the terms of the new agency agreement were determined by negotiations between our management staff  scw s management  and under the review of independent consultants  and ultimately approved by our board of directors 
in rendering its approval  the board of directors considered the fairness of the agreed rates and determined that they were fair to the company based  upon other things  an evaluation of market rates and agreements between the company and its other agents 
significant accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related footnotes 
these estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an on going basis based on historical developments  market conditions  industry trends and other information we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
there can be no assurance that actual results will conform to our estimates and assumptions  and that reported results of operations will not be materially adversely affected by the need to make accounting adjustments to reflect changes in these estimates and assumptions from time to time 
adjustments related to changes in estimates are reflected in the company s earnings in the period those estimates changed 
the following policies are those we believe to be the most sensitive to estimates and judgments 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
such information is incorporated herein by reference 
unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses our consolidated financial statements include estimated reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses related to our various insurance lines of business 
we have actuaries on our staff that analyze and develop projections of ultimate payments that will be made to settle all losses incurred as of each balance sheet date  and the related loss adjustment expenses 
our actuaries utilize standard actuarial techniques to project ultimate losses based on our paid and incurred loss information and claim count  as well as industry data 
these projections are done using the company s data  including the number of claims reported and paid  and the average severity of reported and paid claims  as well as industry data 
this process assumes that past experience  adjusted for the effects of current developments and anticipated trends  is an appropriate basis for predicting future events 
a key projection used in the actuarial estimation of ultimate losses takes an average payment severity times a projected total number of claims frequency 
accordingly  any changes in the frequency or severity of claims reported to us can have a significant impact on actuarial estimates of ultimate losses and recorded reserves 
based on these quantitative as well as other qualitative factors  such as a review of current pricing and underwriting initiatives  an evaluation of reinsurance costs and retention levels  and the current reserving practices of the company s claims department  we select a best estimate of ultimate future losses  and then record this best estimate in the company s consolidated financial statements 
as required by insurance regulatory authorities  we receive an annual statement of opinion by an independent consulting actuary concerning the adequacy of our reserves 
when a claim is reported to us  claims personnel establish a case reserve for the estimated amount of the ultimate payment 
this estimate reflects an informed judgment based upon insurance reserving practices appropriate for the relevant line of business  and on the experience and knowledge of the estimator regarding the nature and value of the specific claim  the severity of injury or damage  and the policy provisions relating to the type of loss 
case reserves are periodically reviewed and adjusted as necessary by the claims staff as more information becomes available 
reserves for claims incurred but not reported provide for the future reporting of claims already incurred  and development on claims already reported 
the reserve for claims incurred but not reported is determined based on historical loss trends 
it often takes several years for medical professional liability claims to be resolved  three to six years on average from the time the loss is reported 
as a result  the ultimate payment can be difficult to project due to changes in legal and other economic environmental factors during the intervening period 
in addition  changes in the company s case reserving philosophy  such as those executed by the company over the last two years  can introduce additional uncertainty into the actuarial estimation process  as a strengthening of case reserves results in higher reported losses  which increases the average severity of claims used in actuarial projections 
therefore  careful consideration must be made when evaluating the strengthening of case reserves to ensure that the impact on ultimate projected losses is not under or overstated 
the process of estimating the reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses involves significant judgment and is complex and imprecise due to the number of variables and assumptions inherent in the estimation process 
these variables include the effects on ultimate loss payments of internal factors such as changes in claims handling practices and changes in the mix of our products  as well as external factors such as changes in loss severity trends  economic inflation  judicial trends and legislative and regulatory changes 
in addition  medical professional liability claims may take several years to resolve due to typical delays in reporting claims to us  the often lengthy discovery process  and the time necessary to defend the claim 
in addition  claims with similar characteristics may result in very different ultimate losses depending on the state or region where the claim occurred 
all of these factors contribute to the variability in estimating ultimate loss payments  especially since the affects of many of these variables cannot be directly quantified  particularly on a prospective basis 
although considerable variability is inherent in such estimates  we believe that the reserve for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses is adequate 
however  there can be no assurance that losses will not exceed the reserve for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses  as future trends related to the frequency and severity of claims  and other factors  may develop differently than management has projected 
the assumptions and methodologies used in estimating and establishing the reserve for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses are continually reviewed and any adjustments are reflected as income or expense in the period in which the adjustment is made 
historically  such adjustments have not exceeded of our recorded net reserves as of the beginning of the period  but can materially and adversely affect our results of operations when an adjustment is made 
due to the current volatility of losses in the medical professional liability industry  adjustments have occurred in each of the last several years 
with the exception of reserves for extended reporting period claims discussed below  we do not discount our reserves to recognize the time value of money 
investments investments represent our largest asset and are the primary source of funds to pay insurance claims 
all of our fixed maturity securities are classified as available for sale  which are those securities that would be available to be sold in the future in response to our liquidity needs  changes in market interest rates and asset liability management strategies 
available for sale securities are reported at their estimated fair value  with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of other comprehensive income  net of deferred taxes 
investment income includes amortization of premium and accrual of discount on the yield to maturity method relating to investments acquired at other than par value 
equity securities are carried at quoted market values 
the fair value of fixed maturity securities is based on market quotations provided to us by our third party custodian who engages independent third party pricing sources that use valuation models 
the valuation models used by the independent third party pricing sources use indicative information such as ratings  industry  coupon  and maturity along with publicly traded bond prices to determine security specific spreads  and the ultimate fair value of the non publicly traded fixed maturity securities 
real estate is carried at the lesser of historical cost  less accumulated depreciation or estimated fair value as determined by recent appraisals  offers from prospective independent third party buyers  or the undiscounted future cash flows associated with the property 
realized gains or losses on sales or maturities of investments are determined on a specific identification basis and are credited or charged to income 
we periodically review our investment portfolio for any potential credit quality or collection issues and for any securities with respect to which we consider any decline in market value to be other than temporary 
investments which are considered to be other than temporarily impaired otti are written down to their estimated net realizable value as of the end of the period in which the otti was noted 
subsequent recoveries in the fair value of impaired securities are not reported in income  but rather as unrealized gains  net of tax  in comprehensive income 
inherent in our evaluation of a particular security are assumptions and estimates about the operations of the issuer  and its future liquidity and earnings potential 
some of the factors considered in evaluating whether a decline in market value is other than temporary are our ability and intent to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in value  the recoverability of principal and interest related to the security  the duration and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost for equity securities  or amortized cost for fixed maturity securities  the financial condition  near term and long term earnings and cash flow prospects of the issuer  including relevant industry conditions and trends  and implications of rating agency actions  and the specific reasons that a security is in a significant unrealized loss position  including market conditions that could affect access to liquidity 
the following table shows the aging of unrealized losses included in our investment portfolio as of december  security type months in thousands fixed maturity equity total during the year ended december   we recorded an impairment charge of million on enhanced equipment trust certificates that were issued by delta airlines 
during the years ended december  and we recorded an impairment charge of  and million  respectively related to bonds issued by frontier corporation  a subsidiary of global crossings 
at december   the company s investment in delta enhanced equipment trust certificates is carried in the consolidated balance sheets  included elsewhere in this report  at a value of million 
in december of  the frontier bonds  as part of bankruptcy proceedings  were converted to equity securities of frontier s parent company  global crossings 
we received a total of  shares of global crossing common stock based on the amount of bonds held by the company 
these shares had an initial fair value of per share  which resulted in a realized gain of approximately  upon the conversion 
reserve for extended reporting period claims a portion of the coverage that physicians purchase under claims made policies is for an additional death  disability and retirement ddr insurance benefit 
this ddr coverage provides coverage to the physician for any prior incidents occurring during the coverage period that are reported after their death  disability or retirement 
the loss exposure associated with this product is known as extended reporting period claims 
the reserve for extended reporting period claims coverage is recorded during the term of the original claims made policy  based on the present value of future estimated benefits  including morbidity and mortality assumptions  less the present value of expected future premiums associated with this ddr coverage 
the reserves for these claims fluctuate based on the number of physicians who are eligible for this coverage and their age 
any changes in the ddr reserves are reflected as an expense in the period in which we become aware that an adjustment is necessary 
at december  and  our recorded ddr reserves were million 
reinsurance in accordance with industry practice  we cede to other insurance companies some of the potential liability under insurance policies we have underwritten 
this practice  called reinsurance  helps us reduce our net liability on individual risks  stabilize our underwriting results and increase our underwriting capacity 
as payment for sharing a portion of our risk  we are also required to share a part of the premium we receive on the related policies 
we determine the amount and scope of reinsurance coverage to purchase each year based upon an evaluation of the risks accepted  consultations with reinsurance brokers and a review of market conditions  including the availability and pricing of reinsurance 
our reinsurance arrangements are generally renegotiated annually 
reinsurance premiums and losses related to reinsured business are accounted for on bases consistent with those used in accounting for the original policies issued and the terms of the reinsurance contracts 
premiums ceded to other companies are reported as a reduction of premium income 
reinsured losses incurred are reported as a reduction of gross losses incurred 
under our primary professional liability reinsurance contract  the portion of the policyholder premium ceded to the reinsurers is swing rated  or experience rated on a retrospective basis 
this swing rated contract is subject to a minimum and maximum premium range to be paid to the reinsurers in the future  depending upon the extent of losses actually paid by the reinsurers 
we pay a provisional premium during the initial policy year 
a liability is recorded to represent an estimate of net additional payments to be made to the reinsurers under the program  based on the level of loss and lae reserves recorded 
to the extent that our estimate for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses changes  the amount of swing rated reinsurance premiums may also change 
we annually review the financial stability of all of our reinsurers 
this review includes a ratings analysis of each reinsurer participating in a reinsurance contract 
on the basis of this review  as of december   we concluded that an allowance for uncollectible reinsurance recoverables was unnecessary 
we do  however  have a reinsurance recoverable from gerling global gerling of approximately million million net of ceded premiums payable of million  at december  in  gerling s parent company put gerling s united states subsidiary into run off resulting in a series of am best rating downgrades for gerling 
we have discussed the possibility of a settlement with gerling  but have not received an offer that we deem financially adequate 
we continue to believe that gerling has adequate surplus and cash flow to satisfy its obligations to us and we have not experienced any difficulties in collecting amounts due from gerling  however  there can be no assurance that amounts currently recoverable from gerling will ultimately be collected 
because the company has not experienced any difficulties in collecting amounts from gerling  and in light of gerling s current surplus levels and cash flows  we determined not to accept the settlement offer because we do not believe that it is in the company s best long term economic interest 
we will continue to monitor gerling s financial strength and liquidity and may pursue a settlement in the future if circumstances change 
the periodic analysis of gerling includes reviews of gerling s publicly available financial information  as well as monitoring of trade publications and press releases 
should there be a material change in the financial condition of gerling  our assessment of its ability to meet its obligations to us may also change 
our assessment of the financial strength and liquidity of gerling is the primary basis by which we have determined not to record a valuation allowance against this recoverable 
income taxes deferred federal income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to the differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities  and their respective tax bases 
accounting for deferred taxes in accordance with gaap requires us to make a qualitative analysis of our deductible temporary differences  past financial history and future earnings projections to determine how much of a deferred tax asset can be recognized 
the standard for measuring whether or not a gross deferred tax asset can be recognized is more likely than not based on all available evidence 
in making this evaluation  historical losses weigh more heavily than future earnings projections due to uncertainties inherent in making such projections 
accordingly based on our recent loss experience  we have determined that sufficient taxable income may not exist in the periods of reversal  and have recorded a deferred tax asset valuation allowance for the entire net deferred tax asset as  under the accounting guidance  there is no reasonable basis to support carrying some of the individual deferred tax assets and not others 
the establishment of the valuation allowance is recorded as federal income tax expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of income  included elsewhere in this report 
once the company has re established a pattern of profitability  the deferred tax asset valuation allowance may be reduced upon evaluation of the availability of future taxable income 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the deferred tax valuation allowance and its impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
such information is incorporated herein by reference 
earned but unbilled premiums in addition to premiums earned on written premiums  the company also recognizes premium income for any changes in estimated earned but unbilled premiums in connection with future audit premium billings on workers compensation insurance policies 
audit premiums are retroactive adjustments made after the policy s expiration that result in either additional premium billings or premium refunds based on the insured s actual employee head count and other factors 
earned but unbilled premiums represent the portion of estimated future audit premiums that will be billed in future periods  but have been earned during the period based on the effective dates of the policies that are expected to generate the future audit premium billings 
estimated future audit premium billings are based on historical audit premium billings  adjusted for factors related to the current economic environment 
to the extent that there are changes in the classes of businesses that we insure  or that the headcount at insured businesses changes based on the overall economic environment  our use of historical data to estimate future earned but unbilled premiums may result in amounts that differ from actual billings 
the estimate for earned but unbilled premiums at december  and was  and  respectively 
deferred policy acquisition costs deferred policy acquisition costs dac are those costs that vary with and are primarily related to the production of new  or renewal  business and include such costs as commissions  premium taxes and other costs incurred in connection with writing business 
these costs are deferred and amortized over the period in which the related premiums are earned 
under gaap  the premiums that will be earned in future periods  to which these deferred costs relate  must produce sufficient profits to offset the future expense that will be recognized from the amortization of the dac  that is  the dac must be recoverable 
in evaluating the recoverability of dac  we have made certain assumptions regarding future costs associated with the business written  such as costs to maintain the policies and the ultimate projected loss and loss adjustment expense payments associated with these policies 
in addition  we have considered future investment income in determining the recoverability of dac  which requires certain assumptions regarding the timing of payments of future loss and loss adjustment expenses  as well as the yield on our investment portfolio 
based on our analysis as of december   the dac carried on the consolidated balance sheets  included elsewhere in this report  of million  was deemed to be fully recoverable 
while we believe that our assumptions and estimates related to the recoverability of dac are reasonable  historically  our accident year loss ratios have developed unfavorably 
in the event that future unfavorable adjustments to loss reserves occur  the likelihood of our being able to recover these deferred costs will diminish  and the possibility of a write off of a portion or all of our dac in future periods will increase 
description of ratios analyzed in the analysis of our operating results that follows  we refer to various financial ratios that management uses to analyze and compare the underwriting results of our insurance operations 
these ratios are calculated on a gaap basis and include loss ratio this ratio compares our losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred  net of reinsurance  to our net premiums earned  and indicates how much we expect to pay policyholders for claims and related settlement expenses compared to the amount of premiums we earn 
the calendar year loss ratio uses all losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred in the current calendar year ie  related to all accident years 
the accident year loss ratio uses only those loss and loss adjustment expenses that relate to the current accident year ie  excludes the effect of development on prior year loss reserves 
the lower the percentage  the more profitable our insurance business is  all other things being equal 
underwriting expense ratio this ratio compares our expenses to obtain new business and renew existing business  plus normal operating expenses  to our net premiums earned 
the ratio is used to measure how efficient we are at obtaining business and operating the insurance segments 
the lower the percentage  the more efficient we are  all else being equal 
sometimes  however  a higher underwriting expense ratio can result in better business and improve our loss ratio  and overall profitability 
combined ratio this ratio equals the sum of our loss ratio and underwriting expense ratio 
the lower the percentage  the more profitable our insurance business is 
this ratio excludes the effects of investment income 
the statutory ratios will differ from gaap ratios as a result of differences in accounting between the statutory basis of accounting and gaap 
additionally  the denominator for the underwriting expense ratio for gaap is net premiums earned  versus net premiums written for the statutory underwriting expense ratio 
results of operations consolidated results of operations the following table sets forth our results of operations for the years ended december   and on a consolidated basis 
the discussion that follows should be read in connection with the consolidated financial statements  and notes thereto  included elsewhere in this report

the unfavorable development on prior year loss reserves was primarily related to our medical professional liability segment  and was the result of an increase in paid loss severity noted during the third quarter  particularly in our florida  ohio and kentucky markets 
we also established the deferred tax valuation allowance in the third quarter of  as there was not adequate support regarding the availability of future taxable income based on our recent loss history 
our net loss in was primarily the result of a million underwriting loss  and a million charge  net of tax  for the write off of goodwill  which was recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  partially offset by million of investment income 
net premiums earned decreased during  as compared to  primarily as a result of the restructuring of our workers compensation book of business that began in in the fourth quarter of  we announced our intention to exit the workers compensation and health insurance lines of business  which is anticipated to cause a decrease in our net premiums earned in the yield on our investment portfolio was for compared to for the lower yield in was the result of a general decline in interest rates combined with a higher cash balance during the first part of the year  which produces a significantly lower yield than longer term more productive assets 
we delayed investing a portion of the cash flow generated during the first half of due to the very low interest rate environment and our reluctance to lock in longer term interest rates at prevailing levels 
incurred loss and loss adjustment expenses increased during as a result of the million of unfavorable development on prior year loss reserves mentioned above 
prior year unfavorable loss reserve development in was million 
the consolidated calendar year loss ratio for the year was  consisting of on prior accident years and on the current accident year

see effects of new accounting pronouncements for further discussion regarding our investment in pic 
we believe that the current pricing environment for medical professional liability insurance is favorable 
we expect medical professional liability direct premiums written to increase moderately in the future as the company is granted additional rate increases by regulatory authorities 
however  this growth may be limited by our ability to allocate appropriate levels of statutory capital and surplus to the medical professional liability segment 
the decrease in premiums related to our exit from the florida and other markets is expected to be offset by rate increases in other states 
while we do not anticipate any significant decline in business as a result of our recent am best downgrades  the downgrades could adversely impact our competitive position within the marketplace  making it more difficult to retain or attract new policyholders 
our net premiums written and earned during did not increase as much as direct premiums written primarily due to an increase in the cost of reinsurance  which resulted in additional ceded written and earned premiums 
the increase in incurred loss and loss adjustment expenses was primarily the result of million of adverse development on prior year loss and loss adjustment expense reserves in the third quarter of this unfavorable development is discussed more fully under item business loss and loss adjustment expense reserves

the loss ratio  on an accident year basis  was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the decrease in the accident year loss ratio was primarily the result of rate increases taken in all markets 
the increase in underwriting expenses was the result of increased salaries and employee relations costs as we added to our claims and underwriting personnel 
in addition  higher premium volumes resulted in increased commissions and premium taxes 
we anticipate that the medical professional liability underwriting ratio may increase in the near future due to the increased allocation of corporate and other overhead expense to this segment as we exit the workers compensation and health lines 
compared to the increase in direct premiums written was primarily the result of premium rate increases and reduced discounts instituted by the company in late and continued through  partially offset by our exit from the florida market  which began in december of insured physician counts were relatively flat from december  to december  during and  we experienced adverse development on prior year loss reserves 
the adverse development  approximately million  emerged primarily in our florida and ohio markets where loss frequency and severity have both exceeded our original expectations 
the adverse development on prior year loss reserves  approximately million  was the result of a significant increase in reported losses in the second half of losses on prior accident years increased in our ohio  florida and kentucky markets and were caused primarily by a dramatic increase in loss severity 
the accident year loss ratio was for the year ended december   compared to for the decrease in the accident year loss ratio is the direct result of premium rate increases  and reduced discounts taken in the increase in underwriting expenses from to was primarily the result of increased commissions and premium taxes on the higher premium volume

in june  the company filled several executive and management positions in its workers compensation segment 
these positions were filled to improve the overall performance of this segment  reduce risk exposures and improve profitability 
however  during  the workers compensation market remained very competitive and the growth of this line did not keep pace with expectations 
as a result  in the third quarter of  management made the decision to exit this line of business 
management has determined that non renewing our workers compensation policies is the most effective way to achieve the exit of this line of business 
as a result  apcapital ceased discussions to sell its workers compensation policy renewals under the terms of a previously announced non binding letter of intent 
we are required by various state regulatory authorities to provide a notification period  typically to days  to insureds prior to non renewing their policies to provide them time to find alternative coverage 
we began mailing non renewal notices in february  which means that additional written premiums may continue into the second quarter of net premiums earned did not decrease as much as direct premiums written as we continued to earn in the premiums that were written in the restructuring of this book of business  combined with rate increases and improved claims management  have translated into lower calendar year and accident year loss ratios  which were and  respectively  for the year ended december  compared to and  respectively  for the same period of the benefits of the improved claims management and rate increases  however  were partially offset by an increase in loss adjustment expenses related primarily to salaries  in the first half of  of the executives and managers the company hired to restructure the workers compensation book of business  as well as assessments related to workers compensation business in the state of minnesota 
salary and employee relations costs related to the management team during the first half of  combined with the decreases in net premiums earned  were the primary reasons for the increases in the underwriting expense ratios 
management is continuing to pursue a loss portfolio transfer of our existing workers compensation reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses 
as of december  workers compensation reserves totaled million  million net of reinsurance 
compared to workers compensation net premiums earned increased for the year ended december  compared to  primarily as a result of continuing to earn premiums written in  which exceeded those written in due to policy growth in  primarily in our minnesota  illinois and indiana markets 
the decrease in the loss ratio from to was due to an overall pattern of increasing premium rates and reduced discounts in all markets  as well as a million reserve enhancement related to prior accident years in there was no reserve development related to prior accident years in the decrease in the workers compensation underwriting expense ratio resulted primarily from the growth in net premiums earned for the year ended december  as compared with  as underwriting expenses remained relatively flat

the number of covered lives at december  was  compared to  at december   a decrease of approximately 
over the same period  the average per member per month premium increased from at december  to at december  we expect to see premiums for this segment continue to decrease due to a further decline in the number of covered lives as we tighten underwriting standards and raise rates during the first half of  after which we will discontinue issuing new health insurance policies 
effective december   we gave notice to the third party that administers our health plan of our intent to exit the health insurance market 
in accordance with the contract between the company and the third party administrator tpa  we are required to give a day notice of our intent to terminate the agreement between us and the tpa 
therefore  we will continue to write health policies through june   however  we intend to follow strict underwriting and pricing guidelines during this period 
the decrease in the incurred loss and loss adjustment expense ratio was primarily the result of improved underwriting and premium rate increases 
the decreases in underwriting expenses and the underwriting expense ratio were primarily due to the reduction of certain corporate overhead expenses related to the health insurance segment as well as a reduction in fees charged by a tpa who handles policy administration and premium collections on behalf of the company 
compared to the increase in direct premiums written was the result of rate increases  of up to  implemented in  as well as moderate membership growth in the fourth quarter of health net premiums earned increased less than direct premiums written as  in june  we discontinued assuming health premiums from a pool that we had previously participated in 
the increase in incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses was primarily the result of increased health care costs and membership growth during the fourth quarter of these increases were mostly offset by an increase in net premiums earned  causing the loss ratio to remain relatively flat 
the increase in underwriting expenses was primarily the result of additional commissions and premium taxes on higher premium volumes 
the decrease in the health underwriting ratio was primarily the result of holding underwriting salaries and employee benefit costs relatively constant  while net premiums earned increased during the year ended december  personal and commercial beginning january   we began non renewing all personal and commercial lines policies 
the negative net premiums earned for and   and  respectively  primarily represent retrospective premium adjustments related to certain personal and commercial reinsurance treaties 
net premiums earned in were million as a result of continuing to earn premiums on policies written in  prior to non renewing all policies

for this segment  loss before federal income taxes  minority interests and cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the same period of the increase was primarily attributable to higher general and administrative expenses as a result of increased legal  audit  and other professional fees pertaining to compliance with the new sarbanes oxley legislation and related sec rules 
as well as legal and investment banking fees incurred in the fourth quarter pursuant to the board of directors evaluation of alternatives to maximize shareholder value after the loss reported in the third quarter  as well as interest expense as a result of the issuance of floating rate junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
such information is incorporated herein by reference 
the increase in these expenses was partially offset by an increase in other income 
compared to loss before federal income taxes  minority interests and cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the same period of the decrease in net loss was primarily attributable to the restructuring charges incurred in liquidity and capital resources the primary sources of our liquidity  on both a short and long term basis  are funds provided by insurance premiums collected  net investment income  recoveries from reinsurers and proceeds from the maturity or sale of invested assets 
we also enter into financing transactions from time to time to acquire additional capital 
the primary uses of cash  on both a short and long term basis  are losses  loss adjustment expenses  operating expenses  the acquisition of invested assets and fixed assets  reinsurance premiums  interest payments  taxes  and the repurchase of the company s stock 
our holding company s only material assets are the capital stock of american physicians and its other subsidiaries  and a portion of the proceeds from recently issued junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures debentures 
apcapital s ongoing cash flow will consist primarily of dividends and other permissible payments from its subsidiaries and investment earnings on funds held 
the payment of dividends to apcapital by its insurance subsidiaries is subject to limitations imposed by applicable law 
apcapital s primary uses of cash  on both a short and long term bases include periodic interest payments  operating expenses  and the repayment of the debentures 
in january  apcapital made a million surplus contribution to its subsidiary american physicians 
the purpose of the contribution was to increase american physicians statutory capital and surplus  which is a critical factor in the financial stability rating process by insurance rating agencies such as am best 
after the contribution  apcapital s cash and cash equivalent resources totaled approximately million  which will be held at the holding company for future debt service costs 
the million of cash and cash equivalents held at the holding company is adequate to service interest payments on the debentures for approximately one and a half years 
at december   the company was indebted is to its former president and chief executive officer in the amount of million in connection with the purchase of stratton cheeseman management company 
as a result of his retirement  effective december   the note payable became due  and was paid in its entirety in january in may  the company issued debentures totaling million 
these debentures bear interest at a variable rate based on the london interbank offered rate libor  payable quarterly  and mature in years 
substantially all of the proceeds from the debenture issuance were contributed to american physicians 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of the debentures and the transactions in which they were issued 
such information is incorporated herein by reference 
the company also completed an additional debenture issuance in the fourth quarter of that was subsequently unwound prior to year end with such debentures being redeemed at par 
the net effect of the issuance and redemption did not have a material effect on our results of operations  financial condition or liquidity 
at december   we had no material planned expenditures for the acquisition of assets  or other expenditures  other than expenses incurred in the normal course of operations 
in september  the board of directors authorized the company to purchase an additional  shares of its outstanding common stock 
this brings the total number of shares authorized to be repurchased under publicly announced plans to  the company repurchased   and  shares  at a cost of million  million and million  during  and  respectively  bringing the total number of shares purchased pursuant to these authorizations to  at a total cost of  or an average price per share of 
the company s repurchase of any of its shares is subject to limitations that may be imposed by applicable laws and regulations and the rules of the nasdaq stock market 
the timing of the purchases and the number of shares to be bought at any one time depend on market conditions and the company s capital requirements 
as of december   the company has approximately  shares of its september  stock repurchase program remaining to be purchased 
the company does not anticipate repurchasing any of its shares in the near future 
our net cash flow generated by operations was approximately million for the year ended december   compared to million provided by operations for the cash generated by operations in was primarily the result of premiums collected  net of reinsurance premiums paid  of approximately million in excess of losses paid of approximately million 
premiums collected in excess of losses paid in were approximately million 
in general  our investment income offsets cash paid for underwriting and general and administrative expenses 
a large portion of our investment expense is related to depreciation on investment in real estate  which is a non cash charge 
anticipated premium rate increases are expected to have a positive impact on our cash flows from operations in at december   the company had million of cash and cash equivalents available and an investment portfolio of million 
the portfolio includes million of bonds maturing in the next year to meet short term cash flow needs 
on a long term basis  fixed income securities are purchased on a basis intended to provide adequate cash flows from future maturities to meet future policyholder obligations and ongoing cash needs to fund operations 
as of december   our fixed maturity portfolio included million of bonds that mature in the next one to five years and million that mature in the next five to ten years 
in addition  at december   we have million of mortgage backed securities that provide periodic principal repayments 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the anticipated maturities of our fixed maturity securities 
such information is incorporated herein by reference 
based on historical trends  market conditions and our business plans  we believe that our existing resources and sources of funds will be sufficient to meet our short and long term liquidity needs 
however  economic  market and regulatory conditions may change  and there can be no assurance that our funds will be sufficient to meet these liquidity needs 
in addition  in order to support future premium growth as a result of planned rate increases  or to support our am best rating  our insurance subsidiaries may require additional capital 
accordingly  we are exploring options with respect to raising future capital 
financial condition in evaluating our financial condition  two factors are the most critical 
first  the availability of adequate statutory capital and surplus to satisfy state regulators and to support our current am best rating  and second  the adequacy of our reserves for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses 
statutory capital and surplus our statutory capital and surplus surplus at december  was approximately million  which results in a net premiums written to surplus ratio of statutory surplus at december  was approximately million  for a net premiums written to surplus ratio of the increase in our ratio of net premiums written to surplus was primarily the result of the third quarter charge for unfavorable development on prior year loss reserves related to our medical professional liability segment  which reduced our statutory surplus by approximately million 
the exit from the workers compensation and health insurance lines of business in is expected to make additional surplus available to support future medical professional liability premiums 
however  as approximately million of our statutory surplus is related to our apspecialty and ica insurance subsidiaries  we are considering alternatives on how to maximize our use of that surplus to support the medical professional liability premium writings in american physicians 
these alternatives include a pooling arrangement between apspecialty and american physicians  and or a statutory merger among our various insurance subsidiaries 
in january  apcapital contributed million to american physicians 
we are also considering various options with respect to raising additional capital at the holding company level  which could then be contributed to american physicians 
reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses the adequacy of our reserves for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses is another critical factor in evaluating our financial condition 
for the year ended december   we recorded an increase in ultimate loss estimates  net of reinsurance  for accident years and prior of million  or of million of net loss and loss adjustment expense reserves as of december  the increase in net ultimate loss estimates reflected revisions in the estimated reserves as a result of actual claims activity in calendar year that differed from projected activity 
specifically  in the third quarter of  a pattern of increasing paid severity emerged on our medical professional liability losses related to the through accident years 
in light of this higher than expected trend of average paid severity  our internal and independent actuaries made significant upward revisions to their estimated ultimate severities on all claims incurred in those accident years  which had the effect of significantly increasing the projected ultimate losses on those years 
accordingly  recorded reserves on those years were adjusted to match these ultimate loss projections 
the following table shows reported claim counts  open claim counts  the average net case reserve per open claim  and the average claim payment on claims that were closed with a payment for our medical professional liability segment at or for the years ended december   and average net case average paid number number reserve claim per at or for the year ended of reported of open per open claim closed december  claims claims claim with payment due to the long tailed nature of the medical professional liability line of insurance  changes in the actuarially projected ultimate loss severity can have an even greater impact on the balance of recorded reserves than with most other property and casualty insurance lines 
while we believe that our estimate for ultimate projected losses related to our medical professional liability segment is adequate based on our open and reported claim counts  there can be no assurance that additional significant reserve enhancements will not be necessary in the future given the many variables inherent in such estimates and the extended period of time that it can take for claim patterns to emerge 
activity in the liability for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses by insurance segment for the year ended december  was as follows medical personal professional workers and all liability compensation health commercial segments in thousands balance  december  less  reinsurance recoverables net reserves  december  incurred related to current year prior years paid related to current year prior years net reserves  december  plus  reinsurance recoverables balance  december  development as a of december  net reserves also see part i item business loss and loss adjustment expense reserves for a longer term view on the development of our prior year loss reserves

other significant balance sheet items our invested assets consist primarily of fixed maturity and equity securities  which are carried in the consolidated balance sheets  included elsewhere in this report  at their estimated fair value  and investment real estate and real estate limited partnerships 
at december   our investment portfolio included net unrealized gains of approximately million  an increase of million as compared to december  net unrealized gains are reported  net of tax  in the shareholders equity section of the consolidated balance sheets  included elsewhere in this report  and represented approximately and of consolidated shareholders equity at december  and  respectively 
generally  the estimated fair value of our fixed maturity securities is inversely related to current interest rates 
therefore  as interest rates rise or fall  our net unrealized gains will change accordingly 
see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk  for further information regarding the potential impact of changes in prevailing interest rates on the fair value of our fixed maturity portfolio 
also see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more detail regarding our invested assets 
the cross referenced information is incorporated herein by reference 
reinsurance recoverables increased million  or  to million at december  reinsurance recoverables  on a gaap basis  represent reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses ceded under the various reinsurance treaties we have in place  as well as receivables from reinsurers for loss payments we have made and are entitled to recover under the terms of the treaties 
the increase in reinsurance recoverables is relatively consistent with the increase in the liability for direct and assumed unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses 
included in reinsurance recoverables are million of reserves and paid losses ceded to gerling global 
management s assessment of the ultimate collectibility of this recoverable is discussed more fully in the reinsurance section under significant accounting policies 
at december   we have no recorded deferred federal income tax assets due to the establishment of a valuation allowance during the valuation allowance was established in the third quarter of based on the company s recent loss experience  it is uncertain that sufficient taxable income will exist in the periods of when the deductible temporary differences that gave rise to the deferred tax assets are expected to reverse 
the establishment of the valuation allowance is recorded as federal income tax expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of income  included elsewhere in this report 
once the company has re established a pattern of profitability  the deferred tax asset valuation allowance may be reduced in whole or in part upon evaluation of the availability of future taxable income

accrued expenses and other liabilities at december  were million  an increase of million compared to december  this increase was primarily attributable to a million increase in ceded reinsurance premiums payable  primarily related to our medical professional liability reinsurance treaties  and a million increase in accrued expenses 
our medical professional liability reinsurance treaties are swing rated  on a retrospective basis 
in accordance with the treaties  we pay a provisional premium to the reinsurer  and after three years  the provisional premium is either increased or decreased depending on the actual loss experience on the business written during a given treaty year 
in light of our recent loss experience  especially related to accident years and  we have recorded the maximum liability for premiums due under the treaties for the and accident years 
for the accident year  we have recorded an additional liability for future premiums due  however  we have not recorded the maximum liability due to the improved loss ratio for that accident year 
accordingly  our exposure for additional ceded premiums on the accident year is approximately  the increase in accrued expenses was primarily the result of a change in the way certain workers compensation surcharges were assessed during this change caused us to have to record an additional liability of approximately million 
shareholders equity at december  was million  a decrease of million from million at december  the decrease in shareholders equity was primarily attributable to the reported net loss of million for the year ended december   stock repurchases of million  offset by an increase in unrealized gains  net of tax  of million

 effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december   a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity should be recognized and measured initially at fair value only when the liability is incurred 
under the previous restructuring accounting guidance  companies were permitted to record a liability for costs associated with exit or disposal activities at the date that management had formally committed to the activity and announced its plan 
as a result of this change in accounting practices  approximately  of estimated future employee separation costs associated with the exit of our workers compensation line of business were not recorded as a liability at december   but rather will be accrued prospectively over the remaining future minimum service period required of the employees affected

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general market risk is the risk of loss due to adverse changes in market rates and prices 
we invest primarily in fixed maturity securities  which are interest sensitive assets 
accordingly  our primary market risk is exposure to changes in interest rates 
as of december   the majority of our investment portfolio was invested in fixed maturity securities and short term investments 
the fixed maturity securities primarily consisted of us government and agency bonds  high quality corporate bonds  high yield corporate bonds  mortgage backed securities and tax exempt us municipal bonds 
qualitative information about market risk investments in our portfolio have varying degrees of risk 
the primary market risk exposure to the fixed maturity portfolio is interest rate risk  which is limited somewhat by our management of duration 
the distribution of maturities and sector concentrations are monitored on a regular basis 
equity securities are carried at quoted market values 
the fair value of publicly traded fixed maturity securities is based upon independent market quotations 
the fair value of non publicly traded securities is based on independent third party pricing sources that use valuation models 
the valuation models used by the independent third party pricing sources use indicative information such as ratings  industry  coupon  and maturity along with publicly traded bond prices to determine security specific spreads  and the ultimate fair value of the non publicly traded fixed maturity securities 
realized gains or losses on sales or maturities of investments are determined on a specific identification basis and are credited or charged to income 
at december   approximately of our fixed maturity portfolio excluding approximately million of private placement issues was considered investment grade 
we define investment grade securities as those that have a standards poors credit rating of bbb and above 
non investment grade securities typically bear more credit risk than those of investment grade quality 
credit risk is the risk that amounts due the company by creditors may not ultimately be collected 
we periodically review our investment portfolio for any potential credit quality or collection issues and for any securities with respect to which we consider any decline in market value to be other than temporary

the cross referenced information is included herein by reference 
in june  the company invested approximately million in mortgage backed securities and allocated an additional million for high yield corporate bonds and million for equity security investments 
high yield corporate bonds are typically not investment grade 
approximately million of the mortgage backed securities purchased are interest only certificates 
unlike traditional fixed maturity securities  the fair value of these investments is not inversely related to interest rates  but rather  moves in the same direction as interest rates as the underlying financial instruments are mortgage backed securities 
with mortgage backed securities  as interest rates rise  prepayments will decrease  which means that the interest only certificates will generate interest for a longer period of time than originally anticipated  which in turn will increase the fair value of these investments 
approximately million of these interest only certificates have an inverse floating rate of interest tied to libor 
the company has determined that these inverse floating interest only certificates contain an embedded derivative as defined by sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
because the company cannot readily segregate the fair value of the embedded derivative from the host debt instrument  the entire change in the fair value of these inverse floating interest only certificates is reported in earnings as investment income 
for the year ended december   approximately  was included in investment income for the change in fair value of the inverse floating interest only certificates 
quantitative information about market risk at december   our fixed income security portfolio was valued at million and had an average modified duration of years  compared to a portfolio valued at million with an average modified duration of years at december  of the million at december   million were interest only certificates that had a modified duration of years 
the following tables show the effects of a change in interest rates on the fair value and duration of our entire fixed maturity portfolio at december  and  and then separately for our interest only certificates 
we have assumed an immediate increase or decrease of or in interest rate for illustrative purposes 
you should not consider this assumption or the values shown in the table to be a prediction of actual future results
