streamlining plan in february we announced a plan to streamline the back office and warehouse operations of our computer businesses in the united states 
we anticipate that the streamlining will result in the elimination of approximately jobs and  in conjunction with a january consolidation of united kingdom sales offices which resulted in the elimination of jobs  will result in approximately million pre tax of severance and other restructuring costs  which will be reflected in our first quarter results 
we expect that this plan will result in annual savings of approximately million  excluding the severance and other restructuring costs to be recognized in fiscal products we offer more than  brand name and private label products 
we endeavor to expand and keep current the breadth of our product offerings in order to fulfill the increasingly wide range of product needs of our customers 
computer sales include systemax pcs complemented by offerings of other brand name pcs and notebook computers 
our computer related products include supplies such as laser printer toner cartridges and ink jet printer cartridges  media such as recordable disks and magnetic tape cartridges  peripherals such as hard disks  cd rom and dvd drives  printers and scanners  memory upgrades  data communication and networking equipment  ergonomic accessories such as adjustable monitor support arms and anti glare screens  and packaged software 
we assemble our systemax brand pcs in our  square foot  iso certified facility in fletcher  ohio 
we purchase components and subassemblies from suppliers in the united states as well as overseas 
certain parts and components for our pcs are obtained from a limited group of suppliers 
systemax pcs sold in europe are assembled by third parties 
we also utilize licensed technology and computer software in the assembly of our pcs 
for a discussion of risks associated with these licenses and suppliers  see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations factors that may affect future results and financial condition 
our industrial products include storage equipment such as metal shelving  bins and lockers  light material handling equipment such as hand carts and hand trucks  furniture  small office machines and related supplies  and consumable industrial products such as first aid items  safety items  protective clothing and osha compliance items 
the table below summarizes our mix of sales by product category product type years ended december percentage of net sales computer and computer related products industrial products total sales and marketing we market our products to both business customers and individual consumers 
our business customers include large businesses customers with more than  employees  small and mid sized businesses customers with to  employees  educational organizations and government entities 
we have invested consistently and aggressively in developing a proprietary customer and prospect database 
this database includes more than million names 
we consider our business customers to be the various individuals who work within an organization rather than the business location itself 
the business customer and prospect database includes detailed information  including company size  number of employees  industry  various demographic and geographic characteristics and purchasing history 
we have established an integrated three pronged system of direct marketing to business customers  consisting of relationship marketers  catalog mailings and propriety internet web sites  designed to maximize sales 
our relationship marketers focus their efforts on our business customers by establishing a personal relationship between such customers and a systemax account manager 
the goal of the relationship marketing sales force is to increase the purchasing productivity of current customers and to actively solicit newly targeted prospects to become customers 
with access to the records we maintain of historical purchasing patterns  our relationship marketers are prompted with product suggestions to expand customer order values 
in the united states  we also have the ability to provide such customers with electronic data interchange edi ordering and customized billing services  customer savings reports and stocking of specialty items specifically requested by these customers 
our relationship marketers efforts are supported by frequent catalog mailings and e mail campaigns designed to generate inbound telephone sales  and our interactive websites  which allow customers to purchase products directly over the internet 
we believe that the integration of these three marketing methods enables us to more thoroughly penetrate our business and government customer base 
increased internet exposure can lead to more internet related sales and can also generate more inbound telephone sales  just as catalog mailings which feature our websites can result in greater internet related sales 
we successfully increased our sales to individual consumers through our tiger direct subsidiary  using a combination of e commerce initiatives and catalog mailings 
to reach our consumer audience  we use methods such as website campaigns  banner ads and e mail campaigns 
we are able to monitor and evaluate the results of our various advertising campaigns to enable us to execute them in a cost effective manner 
our catalogs generate calls to inbound sales representatives 
these sales representatives use our information systems to fulfill orders and explore additional customer product needs 
sales to consumers are generally fulfilled from our own stock  requiring us to carry more inventory than we would for our business customers 
we also periodically take advantage of attractive product pricing by making opportunistic bulk inventory purchases with the objective of turning them quickly into sales 
we have also successfully increased our sales to individual consumers with the addition of a number of retail outlet stores 
these stores are located in or near one of our existing sales and distribution centers  thereby minimizing our operating costs 
we presently have four such retail locations in north america and plan to add several more in catalogs we currently produce a total of full line and targeted specialty catalogs under distinct titles 
our portfolio of catalogs includes such established brand names as global computer supplies  tigerdirect 
com  misco  hcs misco  global industrial  arrowstar  dartek 
com and 
full line computer product catalogs offer products such as pcs  notebooks  peripherals  computer components  magnetic media  data communication  networking and power protection equipment  ergonomic accessories  furniture and software 
full line industrial product catalogs offer products such as material handling products and industrial supplies 
specialty catalogs contain more focused product offerings and are targeted to individuals most likely to purchase from such catalogs 
we mail catalogs to both businesses and consumers 
in the case of business mailings  we mail our catalogs to many individuals at a single business location  providing us with multiple points of entry 
our in house staff designs all of our catalogs 
in house catalog production helps reduce overall catalog expense and shortens catalog production time 
this allows us the flexibility to alter our product offerings and pricing and to refine our catalog formats more quickly 
our catalogs are printed by third parties under fixed pricing arrangements 
the commonality of certain core pages of our catalogs also allows for economies in catalog production 
during  we distributed approximately million catalogs  of which approximately million catalogs were mailed in north america and approximately million catalogs were distributed in europe 
this total was approximately fewer than in the prior year as we were able to leverage our advertising spending as a result of increased internet sales 
e commerce we continually upgrade the capabilities and performance of our internet web sites

our internet sites feature on line catalogs of thousands of products 
many of these sites also permit customers to purchase build to order pcs configured to their own specifications 
in we had over million in internet related sales  representing of total revenues  an increase of million from customer service and support we generally provide toll free telephone number access to our customers 
certain of our domestic call centers are linked to provide telephone backup in the event of a disruption in phone service 
in addition to telephone orders  we also receive orders by mail  fax  electronic data interchange and on the internet 
orders are fulfilled on a timely basis and are generally shipped by united parcel service in the united states and by similar national small package delivery services in europe  as well as by various freight lines and local carriers 
most customers receive their orders other than custom items  large furniture and large industrial items shipped directly by the vendor within one or two business days of the order date as a result of the regional locations of our distribution centers 
we provide extensive technical telephone support to our systemax brand pc customers 
we maintain a database of commonly asked questions for our technical support representatives  enabling them to respond quickly to similar questions 
we conduct regular on site training seminars for our sales representatives to help ensure that they are well trained and informed regarding our latest product offerings 
sales and distribution centers a large number of our products are carried in stock  and orders for such products are fulfilled directly from our distribution centers  typically on the day the order is received 
the strategic locations of our distribution centers allow next day or second day delivery via low cost ground carriers throughout most of the united states  canada and western europe 
we maintain relationships with a number of large distributors in the united states and europe that deliver products directly to our customers 
north america we operate out of multiple sales and distribution facilities in north america 
certain of these facilities are linked by a wide area network management information system 
in the event of adverse delivery conditions  such as bad weather at a location  we can shift inbound calls and or order fulfillment and shipping to an alternate location 
we believe this provides us with important operating flexibility and protection from possible sales interruptions for our north american businesses 
europe we have sales and or distribution facilities in eight european countries and a central office in the united kingdom to direct their activities 
the central office is responsible for marketing support  financial reporting  logistics and computer website and programming support 
the locations of our distribution centers in europe have enabled us to market into four additional countries with limited incremental investment 
suppliers we purchase the majority of our products and components directly from manufacturers and large wholesale distributors

we own the tooling for many of these products  including plastic bins  computer accessories  furniture and metal alloy monitor arms 
see research and development costs in footnote to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
competition and other market factors personal computers the north american and european computer markets are highly competitive  with many us  asian and european companies vying for market share 
there are few barriers of entry to the pc market  with pcs being sold through the direct market channel  mass merchants  over the internet and by computer and office supply superstores 
timely introduction of new products or product features are critical elements to remaining competitive 
other competitive factors include product performance  quality and reliability  technical support and customer service  marketing and distribution and price 
some of our competitors have stronger brand recognition  broader product lines and greater financial  marketing  manufacturing and technological resources than us 
additionally  our results could also be adversely affected should we be unable to maintain our technological and marketing arrangements with other companies  such as microsoft  intel and advanced micro devices 
while economic conditions in the united states have recently begun to improve after several years of adverse conditions  economic conditions in europe continue to be unsettled  and  on balance  pc sales continue to be slow 
this continued slowness has resulted in lower selling prices among our competitors  creating an extremely competitive environment that has affected  and may continue to affect  profitability over the short term 
our long term view of the pc market  however  remains optimistic  assuming that the strengthening of us economic conditions continues and conditions in europe improve 
computer related products the north american computer related products market is highly fragmented and characterized by multiple channels of distribution including direct marketers  local and national retail computer stores that carry computer supplies  computer resellers  mass merchants  computer and office supply superstores and internet based resellers 
in europe  our major competitors are regional or country specific retail and direct mail distribution companies and internet based resellers 
as with pcs  the continued slowness of the global economy means the environment remains highly competitive  resulting in the continued reduction in retail prices for computer related products  which may continue to adversely affect our revenues and profits 
additionally  we rely in part upon the introduction of new technologies and products by other manufacturers in order to sustain long term sales growth and profitability 
there is no assurance that the rapid rate of such technological advances and product development will continue 
industrial products the market for the sale of industrial products in north america is highly fragmented and is characterized by multiple distribution channels such as retail outlets  small dealerships  direct mail distribution  internet based resellers and large warehouse stores 
we also face competition from manufacturers own sales representatives  who sell industrial equipment directly to customers  and from regional or local distributors 
many high volume purchasers  however  utilize catalog distributors as their first source of product 
in the industrial products market  customer purchasing decisions are primarily based on price  product selection  product availability  level of service and convenience 
we believe that direct marketing via catalog  the internet and sales representatives is an effective and convenient distribution method to reach mid sized facilities that place many small orders and require a wide selection of products 
in addition  because the industrial products market is highly fragmented and generally less brand oriented  it is well suited to private label products 
we sell a minor amount of industrial products in europe 
employees as of december   we employed a total of  employees  including  full time and part time employees  of whom  were in north america and  were in europe 
environmental matters under various national  state and local environmental laws and regulations in north america and europe  a current or previous owner or operator including the lessee of real property may become liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous substances at such real property 
such laws and regulations often impose liability without regard to fault 
we lease most of our facilities 
in connection with such leases  we could be held liable for the costs of removal or remedial actions with respect to hazardous substances 
although we have not been notified of  and are not otherwise aware of  any material environmental liability  claim or non compliance  there can be no assurance that we will not be required to incur remediation or other costs in connection with environmental matters in the future

overview we are a direct marketer of brand name and private label products  including personal desktop computers  notebook computers  computer related products and industrial products in north america and europe 
we assemble our own pcs and sell them under our own trademarks  which we believe gives us a competitive advantage 
we also sell computers manufactured by other leading companies  such as ibm and hewlett packard 
we offer more than  products and continuously update our product offerings to address the needs of our customers  which include large  mid sized and small businesses  educational and government entities as well as individual consumers 
computers and computer related products account for more than of our net sales  and  as a result  we are dependent on the general demand for information technology products 
the market for computer products is subject to intense price competition and is characterized by narrow gross profit margins 
distribution of information technology products is working capital intensive  requiring us to incur significant costs associated with the warehousing of many products  including the costs of leasing warehouse space  maintaining inventory and tracking systems  and employing personnel to perform the associated tasks 
we supplement our product availability by maintaining relationships with major distributors  utilizing a combination of stocking and drop ship fulfillment 
during fiscal and  our performance and that of the industry as a whole was impacted negatively by the global economic downturn and cautious information technology spending 
as it became evident that the industry was experiencing a prolonged economic downturn  we took measures to align our cost structure with lower revenues and decreasing gross margins 
the primary component of our operating expenses historically has been employee related costs  which includes items such as wages  commissions  bonuses  and benefits 
we have recently made substantial reductions in our workforce and closed or consolidated several facilities 
we have reduced selling  general and administrative expenses from of net sales in to on a comparable basis of net sales in in the first quarter of we announced and began the implementation of a plan to streamline our united states computer business 
this plan will consolidate duplicative back office and warehouse operations  which we expect to result in annual savings of approximately million excluding severance and other restructuring costs of approximately million to be recognized in fiscal the discussion of our results of operations and financial condition that follows will provide information that will assist in understanding our financial statements  the factors that we believe may affect our future results and financial condition as well as information about how certain accounting principles and estimates affect the financial statements 
results of operations we had net income for the year ended december  of million 
for the year ended december   we had a net loss of million  after recording a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of million  net of tax  to reflect the impairment of the entire carrying amount of goodwill 
we had net income for the year ended december  of  the following table represents our consolidated statement of operations data expressed as a percentage of net sales for the three most recent fiscal years net sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses restructuring and other charges goodwill impairment income loss from operations interest expense income taxes income loss before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  net of tax cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  net of tax net income loss net sales net sales for the year ended december  were billion  an increase of from billion for the year ended december  north american sales were billion  a increase from last year s million 
the increase in north american sales was a result of growth in our consumer business 
continued weakness in demand for information technology products from corporate customers resulted in lower sales to those customers 
european sales  in us dollars  increased to million for representing of worldwide sales compared to million representing of worldwide sales in the year ago period 
movements in foreign exchange rates positively impacted european sales for by approximately million 
if currency exchange rates for had prevailed in  european sales would have decreased from the prior year 
lower demand and the effect of exchange rate movements on product pricing in certain european markets resulted in decreased local currency denominated sales 
net sales of billion in were million or higher than the billion reported in the weak worldwide economic environment resulted in reduced demand  particularly in the technology sector 
while sales to individual consumers showed growth  sales to business customers remained weak  as the anticipated replacement cycle for pcs continued to be deferred due to our business customers desire to reduce capital expenditures 
pc sales were million in  representing of the company s net sales  which was largely unchanged from sales in north america decreased to million in from million in primarily as a result of the continuing economic slowdown in the united states 
european sales increased to million in from million in movements in foreign exchange rates positively impacted the european sales comparison by approximately million in compared to excluding the movements in foreign exchange rates  european sales would have been substantially unchanged from the prior year 
european economies continued to weaken during  which is reflected in our results 
we suffered declines in local currencies in after a relatively flat year in and slowing growth in the table below reflects european sales for the three reported years at constant exchange rates in millions european sales as reported european sales at exchange rates gross profit gross profit  which consists of net sales less product cost  shipping  assembly and certain distribution center costs  was million  or of net sales  compared to million  or of net sales  in the year ago period  an increase of million 
as a result of adopting emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor  million of vendor consideration was recorded as a reduction of cost of sales in excluding the impact of eitf  and therefore on a non gaap basis  the gross profit margin would have been in compared to in the non gaap gross profit margin has been included here to provide comparability to the prior year 
the decline in the gross profit margin was due to continued pricing pressure resulting from weak market demand and response to competition and changes in the mix of products sold  as customers continue to shift to lower priced solutions 
gross profit was million in  down  or million  from million in as a percentage of sales  gross profit fell to in  from in this decline resulted from a decline in the gross profit ratio in the company s european operations  which was affected by intense pricing pressure in certain of its markets 
the gross profit ratio in the company s north american business decreased only slightly from as pricing pressures were partially offset by cost reductions resulting from initiatives undertaken in recent years and production efficiencies achieved in the company s pc assembly business 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses for were million compared to million in  a net decrease of million or 
the decrease was realized in our north american operations and included decreased television advertising spending related to sales of the company s pcs 
in addition  as a result of increased internet sales  we were able to leverage our total advertising spending and reduce our other advertising expenses by reducing the number of catalogs we mailed 
these decreases were partially offset by approximately million of increased costs in europe resulting from the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates and the effects of the adoption of eitf the adoption of eitf resulted in the reclassification of million of vendor consideration as a reduction of cost of sales  which would previously have been recorded as a reduction of advertising expense 
as a percentage of sales  selling  general and administrative expenses were on a non gaap basis before the adoption of eitf compared to in the year ago period 
selling  general and administrative expenses totaled million  or of net sales  in  a decrease of million  or  compared to million  or of net sales  in reductions in catalog costs comprised the largest portion of the decrease 
the company also reduced its employee count in the united states  lowering its salary expense and related benefit costs in selling  general and administrative expenses also declined as a result of actions taken to reduce costs and tighten discretionary spending 
these reductions were partially offset by increased salary and other operating expenses in the company s european operations 
restructuring and other charges in the fourth quarter of we implemented a plan to consolidate the warehousing facilities in our united states computer supplies business 
we recorded  of costs related to this plan in the fourth quarter  including  of non cash costs for impairment of the carrying value of fixed assets and  of charges for other exit costs 
during we implemented a plan to consolidate the activities of our three united kingdom locations into a new facility we had constructed 
we incurred million of costs associated with the plan  including million for recruitment  staff relocation and severance and benefits for approximately terminated employees  million of charges for other exit costs  primarily facilities closing and lease terminations  and million of non cash costs for impairment of the carrying value of fixed assets 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal we recorded million of additional costs  net of reductions  related to this plan as a charge to operations 
these charges consisted of million of other restructuring activities as we adjusted the original estimates of lease and contract termination costs and  of additional non cash asset impairments  related to buildings vacated 
in approximately million of previously capitalized costs associated with software projects abandoned were written off 
we also incurred approximately  of costs in related to the consolidation of one of our domestic warehouse locations 
in august we settled our litigation with a software developer and reversed a previously recorded liability of million  which was no longer required 
during the second quarter of  we purchased the minority ownership of our netherlands subsidiary for approximately million  pursuant to the terms of the original purchase agreement 
all of the purchase price was attributable to goodwill and  as a result of an impairment analysis  was written off in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  goodwill and other intangible assets 
during the second quarter of we recorded a non recurring write off of million resulting from our decision to discontinue development of internal use computer software 
income loss from operations we had income from operations of million in  a loss from operations of million in and income from operations for the year ended december  of million 
results in include restructuring and other charges of million and a goodwill impairment charge of million 
the loss from operations in includes million of restructuring and other charges 
income from operations in includes the elimination of a liability of million recorded in a prior year which we determined was no longer required and expense of million for restructuring and other charges 
we had a loss from operations in europe in of million  compared to income from operations of million in and million in european results declined as a result of decreased gross profit  increased selling  general and administrative expenses and million of restructuring and other charges 
interest and other income and interest expense interest expense was million in  million in and million in the increased expense in resulted from increased short term borrowings under our united kingdom facility and a full year of interest expense on long term obligations incurred in we had decreased borrowings under our united states and united kingdom short term credit facilities in  the effect of which was partially offset by interest expense on new long term borrowings entered into during the year 
interest and other income was million in  million in and million in income taxes we recorded an income tax provision of million in  an income tax benefit of million in and an income tax provision of  in the effective rates were in  in and in the effective tax rate in was adversely affected by the goodwill impairment write off  which is not tax deducible 
the mix in taxable income and losses between our u 
s 
and foreign operations and the expected utilization of our deferred tax assets significantly impacted the recording of the tax benefit 
in  we also incurred additional tax expense in connection with audit assessments in two of our foreign subsidiaries 
for the years ended december  and  we have not recognized certain foreign tax credits  certain state tax benefits on losses in the united states and certain benefits on losses in foreign tax jurisdictions due to our inability to carry such credits and losses back to prior years 
accordingly  valuation allowances were recorded against the deferred tax assets associated with those tax credits and net operating loss carryforwards 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle during the first half of  we completed the transitional review for goodwill impairment required by sfas the review indicated that the entire carrying value of the goodwill recorded on our balance sheet was impaired as of january  accordingly  we recorded a transitional impairment loss of million million net of tax or a net loss per share of as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in our statements of operations for the year ended december  net income loss as a result of the above  net income for was million  or 
per basic and diluted share  the net loss for was million  or per basic and diluted share  and net income for was  or 
per basic and diluted share 
seasonality net sales have historically been modestly weaker during the second and third quarter as a result of lower business activity during those months 
the following table sets forth the net sales  gross profit and income loss from operations for each of the quarters since january  amounts in millions 
march june september december net sales percentage of year s net sales gross profit income loss from operations march june september december net sales percentage of year s net sales gross profit income loss from operations financial condition  liquidity and capital resources liquidity is the ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet obligations and commitments from operating activities and the ability to obtain appropriate financing and to convert into cash those assets that are no longer required to meet existing strategic and financing objectives 
therefore  liquidity cannot be considered separately from capital resources that consist of current and potentially available funds for use in achieving long range business objectives and meeting debt service commitments 
currently  our liquidity needs arise primarily from working capital requirements and capital expenditures 
our working capital was million at december   an increase of million from million at the end of this was due principally to a million increase in inventories  a million increase in accounts receivable and a million decrease in accrued expense and other current liabilities offset by a million decrease in cash  a million decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets and a million increase in accounts payable 
our inventories increased to meet the needs of our growing consumer base  as increased stock levels facilitate such sales  while sales to business customers include a large portion of merchandise shipped directly by our vendors 
the increase in accounts receivable was less pronounced  as sales to consumers are generally paid by credit card  which have a day shipment to cash cycle compared to the normal day payment terms offered to our business customers 
we expect that future accounts receivable and inventory balances will fluctuate with the mix of our net sales between consumer and business customers 
we maintain our cash and cash equivalents primarily in money market funds or their equivalent 
as of december   all of our investments mature in less than three months 
accordingly  we do not believe that our investments have significant exposure to interest rate risk 
our cash balance decreased million to million during the year ended december  net cash used in operating activities was million in  compared with net cash provided by operating activities of million in and million in the decrease in cash provided by operations in resulted from changes in our working capital accounts  which used million in cash compared to million in  and resulted primarily from the increase in our inventories and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
this was partially offset by an increase in cash generated from net income adjusted by other non cash items  which provided million in  compared to million provided by these items in the decrease of million in cash provided by operations in was primarily a result of changes in working capital  which used million in cash compared to million provided in  and resulted primarily from increases in our inventories  accounts receivable and prepaid expenses 
cash was provided by operations in by inventory reductions  decreases in accounts receivable and receipt of a tax refund resulting from the loss recorded in the united states in  offset by a decrease in accounts payable 
in  million of cash was used in investing activities  principally million for the purchase of property  plant and equipment  and million for the acquisition of the minority interest in our netherlands subsidiary 
the capital expenditures in included upgrades and enhancements to our information and communications systems hardware and facilities costs for the opening of several retail stores 
cash of million was used in investing activities in this included million of additions to property  plant and equipment  primarily for the completion of a new facility for our united kingdom operations 
in we used cash in investing activities of million  primarily for property  plant and equipment additions 
these expenditures included million for software and systems development and million toward the construction of our united kingdom facility 
we anticipate no major capital expenditures in and will fund any capital expenditures out of cash from operations and borrowings under our credit lines 
net cash of million was used in financing activities in cash of million was used to repay short and long term obligations  which was partially offset by million of cash provided by the issuance of capital leases and  provided by the exercise of stock options 
cash of million was provided by financing activities in from bank borrowings and the mortgaging of our georgia distribution facility and new united kingdom facility 
in  million of cash was used in financing activities  all of which paid down short term borrowings 
under our million united states secured revolving credit agreement  which expires in june  availability as of december  was million 
the revolving credit agreement contains certain financial and other covenants  including restrictions on capital expenditures and payments of dividends 
we were in compliance with all of the covenants as of december  there were outstanding letters of credit of million and there were no outstanding advances as of december  we are in the process of extending this facility through the end of the first quarter of while we negotiate a new agreement 
we also maintain a million million at the december  exchange rate multi currency credit facility with a financial institution in the united kingdom  which is available to our united kingdom subsidiaries 
the facility does not have a termination date  but may be canceled by either party on six months notice 
borrowings under the facility are secured by certain assets of our united kingdom subsidiaries 
at december  there were million million of borrowings outstanding under this line with interest payable at a rate of 
in october our netherlands subsidiary entered into a million million at the december  exchange rate credit facility 
borrowings under the facility are secured by the subsidiary s accounts receivable and are subject to a borrowing base limitation of of the eligible accounts 
at december  there were million million of borrowings outstanding under this line with interest payable at a rate of 
the facility expires in november in we entered into a million million at the december  exchange rate  year term loan agreement with a united kingdom bank  to finance the construction of a new united kingdom facility 
the borrowings are secured by the land and building and are repayable in quarterly installments of   through august the outstanding borrowings bear interest at libor plus basis points at december  
in connection with this term loan  we also entered into an interest rate collar agreement to reduce our exposure to market rate fluctuations 
at december   the notional amount of the interest rate collar was   with an interest rate cap of and a floor of 
the interest rate collar expires on april  as of december   the collar was in a loss position of approximately  and  accordingly  the aggregate fair value of the collar was recorded as a liability 
the change in the fair value of this derivative for the year ended december  has been recognized in the consolidated statement of operations as this hedge was determined to be ineffective 
the term loan agreement contains certain financial and other covenants related to our united kingdom subsidiaries 
in april we entered into a ten year  million mortgage loan on our suwanee  georgia distribution facility 
the mortgage has monthly principal and interest payments of  through may  with a final additional principal payment of million at maturity in may the mortgage loan bears interest at and is collateralized by the underlying land and building 
we are obligated under operating leases for the rental of certain facilities and equipment which expire at various dates through we currently lease our new york facility from an entity owned by richard leeds  robert leeds and bruce leeds  the company s three principal shareholders and senior executive officers 
the annual rental totals  and the lease expires in following is a summary of our contractual obligations for future principal payments on our debt  minimum rental payments on our non cancelable operating leases and minimum payments on our other commitments at december  in thousands after contractual obligations maturities of long term debt      payments on non cancelable      operating leases purchase commitments  total contractual obligations      other commitments letters of credit  n a n a n a n a n a our operating results have generated cash flow which  together with borrowings under our debt agreements  have provided sufficient capital resources to finance working capital and cash operating requirements  fund capital expenditures  and fund the payment of interest on outstanding debt 
our primary ongoing cash requirements will be to finance working capital  fund the payment of principal and interest on indebtedness and fund capital expenditures 
we believe future cash flows from operations and availability of borrowings under our lines of credit as they are expected to be extended will be sufficient to fund ongoing cash requirements 
we are party to certain litigation  as disclosed in commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements  the outcome of which we believe  based on discussions with legal counsel  will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements we have not created  and are not party to  any special purpose or off balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital  incurring debt or operating our business 
we do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into the financial statements that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or the availability of capital resources 
factors that may affect future results and financial condition there are a number of factors and variables that affect our results of operations and financial condition 
following is a description of some of the important factors that may affect future results 
economic conditions have affected and could continue to adversely affect our revenues and profits 
both we and our business customers are subject to global political  economic and market conditions  including military action and the threat of terrorism 
economic conditions in the united states have recently begun to improve after several years of adverse conditions 
economic conditions in europe continue to be unsettled 
if the strengthening of general economic conditions does not continue and if conditions in europe remain weak  our results could continue to be adversely affected 
we may experience a decline in sales as a result of poor economic conditions and the lack of visibility relating to future orders 
our consolidated results of operations depend upon  among other things  our ability to maintain and increase sales volumes with existing customers  our ability to attract new customers and the financial condition of our customers 
a decline in the economy that adversely affects our customers  causing them to limit or defer their spending  would likely adversely affect us as well 
we cannot predict with any certainty whether we will be able to maintain or improve upon historical sales volumes with existing customers  or whether we will be able to attract new customers 
in response to economic and market conditions  from time to time we have undertaken initiatives to reduce our cost structure where appropriate 
the initiatives already implemented as well as any future workforce and facilities reductions undertaken may not be sufficient to meet the changes in economic and market conditions and to achieve future profitability 
in addition  costs actually incurred in connection with our restructuring actions may be higher than our estimates of such costs and or may not lead to the anticipated cost savings 
competitive pressures could harm our revenue and gross margin 
we may not be able to compete effectively with current or future competitors 
the market for our products and services is intensely competitive and subject to constant technological change 
we expect this competition to further intensify in the future 
competitive factors include price  availability  service and support 
we compete with a wide variety of other resellers and retailers  as well as manufacturers 
some of our competitors are larger companies with greater financial  marketing and product development resources than ours 
in addition  new competitors may enter our markets 
this may place us at a disadvantage in responding to competitors pricing strategies  technological advances and other initiatives  resulting in our inability to increase our revenues or maintain our gross margins in the future 
in many cases our products compete directly with those offered by other manufacturers and distributors 
if any of our competitors were to develop products or services that are more cost effective or technically superior  demand for our product offerings could decrease 
our margins are also dependent on the mix of products we sell and could be adversely affected by a continuation of our customers shift to lower priced products 
we are dependent on third party suppliers 
we purchase a significant portion of our computer related products from major distributors such as tech data corporation and ingram micro inc and directly from large manufacturers such as ibm and hewlett packard  who deliver those products directly to our customers 
these relationships enable us to make available to our customers a wide selection of products without having to maintaining large amounts of inventory 
the termination or interruption of our relationships with any of these suppliers could materially adversely affect our business 
our pc products contain electronic components  subassemblies and software that in some cases are supplied through sole or limited source third party suppliers  some of which are located outside of the us although we do not anticipate any problems procuring supplies in the near term  there can never be any assurance that parts and supplies will be available in a timely manner and at reasonable prices 
any loss of  or interruption of supply from key suppliers may require us to find new suppliers 
this could result in production or development delays while new suppliers are located  which could substantially impair operating results 
if the availability of these or other components used in the manufacture of our products was to decrease  or if the prices for these components were to increase significantly  operating costs and expenses could be adversely affected 
a portion of our revenues is derived from the sale of products manufactured using licensed patents  software and or technology 
failure to renew these licenses on favorable terms or at all could force us to stop manufacturing and distributing these products and our financial condition could be adversely affected 
many product suppliers provide us with co op advertising support in exchange for featuring their products in our catalogs and on our internet sites 
certain suppliers provide us with other incentives such as rebates  reimbursements  payment discounts  price protection and other similar arrangements 
these incentives are offset against cost of goods sold or selling  general and administrative expenses  as applicable 
the level of co op advertising support and other incentives received from suppliers may decline in the future  which could increase our cost of goods sold or selling  general and administrative expenses and have an adverse effect on results of operations and cash flows 
we are exposed to inventory risks 
our inventory is subject to risk due to technological change and changes in market demand for particular products 
certain of our suppliers offer limited price protection from the loss in value of inventory and we have limited right to return purchases to suppliers 
the decrease or elimination of price protections or purchase returns could lower our gross margin or result in inventory write downs 
we also periodically take advantage of attractive product pricing by making opportunistic bulk inventory purchases  any resulting excess and or obsolete inventory that we are not able to re sell could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
any inability to enter into such arrangements may significantly impact our sales and profitability 
state and local sales tax collection may affect demand for our products 
our united states subsidiaries collect and remit sales tax in states in which the subsidiaries have physical presence or in which we believe other appropriate nexus to obligate such collection exists 
other states may  from time to time  claim that we have state related activities constituting a sufficient nexus to trigger such collection 
additionally  many other states seek to impose sales tax collection obligations on companies that sell goods to customers in their state even without a physical presence 
such efforts by states have increased recently  as states seek to raise revenues without increasing the tax burden on residents 
we rely  as do other direct mail retailers  on united states supreme court decisions which hold that  without congressional authority  a state may not enforce a sales tax collection obligation on a company that has no physical presence in the state and whose only contacts with the state are through the use of interstate commerce such as the mailing of catalogs into the state and the delivery of goods by mail or common carrier 
we cannot predict whether the nature or level of contacts we have with a particular state will be deemed enough to require us to collect sales tax in that state nor can we be assured that congress or individual states will not approve legislation authorizing states to impose tax collection obligations on all direct mail and or e commerce transactions 
a successful assertion by one or more states that we should collect sales tax on the sale of merchandise could result in substantial tax liabilities for past sales and would result in considerable administrative burdens and costs for us and may reduce demand for our products from customers in such states when we charge customers for such taxes 
we have substantial international operations and we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates and political uncertainties 
we currently have operations located in nine countries outside the united states  and non us sales accounted for of our revenue during our future results could be materially adversely affected by a variety of factors  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates  changes in a country s economic or political conditions  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and natural disasters 
our income tax rate and the value of our deferred tax assets are subject to change 
changes in taxes due to changes in the mix of us and us revenues and profitability  changes in tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability 
we are subject to income taxes in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions 
our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates  changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities  changes in tax laws or by material audit assessments 
the carrying value of our deferred tax assets  which are primarily in the united states  is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in the united states 
in addition  the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits in various jurisdictions and a material assessment by a tax authority could affect our profitability 
business disruptions could adversely impact our revenue and financial condition 
it is our policy to insure for certain property and casualty risks consisting primarily of physical loss to property  business interruptions resulting from property losses  workers compensation  comprehensive general liability  and auto liability 
insurance coverage is obtained for catastrophic property and casualty exposures as well as those risks required to be insured by law or contract 
although we believe that our insurance coverage is reasonable  significant events such as acts of war and terrorism  economic conditions  judicial decisions  legislation and large losses could materially affect our insurance obligations and future expense 
reliance on technology we rely on a variety of information and telecommunications systems in our operations 
our success is dependent in large part on the accuracy and proper use of our information systems  including our telecommunications systems 
to manage our growth  we continually evaluate the adequacy of our existing systems and procedures 
we anticipate that we will regularly need to make capital expenditures to upgrade and modify our management information systems  including software and hardware  as we grow and the needs of our business change 
the occurrence of a significant system failure or our failure to expand or successfully implement our systems could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
our information systems networks  including our web sites  and applications could be adversely affected by viruses or worms and may be vulnerable to malicious acts such as hacking 
although we take preventive measures  these procedures may not be sufficient to avoid harm to our operations  which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
availability of credit and financing 
we require significant levels of capital in our business to finance accounts receivable and inventory 
we maintain credit facilities in the united states and in europe to finance increases in our working capital if cash available is insufficient 
the amount of credit available to us at any point in time may be adversely affected by the quality or value of the assets collateralizing these credit lines 
in addition  if we are unable to renew or replace these facilities at maturity  our liquidity and capital resources may be adversely affected 
however  we have no reason to believe that we will not be able to renew our facilities 
sales to individual consumers exposes us to credit card fraud  which could adversely affect our business 
failure to adequately control fraudulent credit card transactions could increase our expenses 
increased sales to individual consumers  which are more likely to be paid for using a credit card  increases our exposure to fraud 
we employ technology solutions to help us detect the fraudulent use of credit card information 
however  if we are unable to detect or control credit card fraud  we may in the future suffer losses as a result of orders placed with fraudulent credit card data  which could adversely affect our business 
increased costs associated with corporate governance compliance may impact our results of operations 
as a public company  we incur significant legal  accounting and other expenses that we would not incur as a private company 
in addition  the sarbanes oxley act of  as well as new rules subsequently implemented by the securities and exchange commission and new listing requirements subsequently adopted by the new york stock exchange in response to sarbanes oxley  have required changes in corporate governance practices of public companies 
we expect these developments to increase our legal compliance and financial reporting costs and make some activities more costly and time consuming 
these developments may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain directors and officers liability insurance and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage  possibly making it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors  particularly to serve on our audit committee 
we presently cannot estimate the timing or magnitude of additional costs we may incur as a result  however  to the extent these costs are significant  our general and administrative expenses are likely to increase as a percentage of revenue and our results of operations will be negatively impacted 
other factors that could contribute to or cause such differences include  but are not limited to  unanticipated developments in any one or more of the following areas i the effect on us of volatility in the price of paper and periodic increases in postage rates  ii the operation of our management information systems  iii significant changes in the computer products retail industry  especially relating to the distribution and sale of such products  iv timely availability of existing and new products  v risks involved with e commerce  including possible loss of business and customer dissatisfaction if outages or other computer related problems should preclude customer access to us  vi risks associated with delivery of merchandise to customers by utilizing common delivery services such as the united states postal service and united parcel service  including possible strikes and contamination  vii borrowing costs or availability  viii pending or threatened litigation and investigations and ix the availability of key personnel  as well as other risk factors which may be detailed from time to time in our securities and exchange commission filings 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward looking statements contained in this report  which speak only as of the date of this report 
we undertake no obligation to publicly release the result of any revisions to these forward looking statements that may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unexpected events 
critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the policies below have been identified as critical to our business operations and understanding the results of operations 
certain accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty  and as a result  actual results could differ from those estimates 
these judgments are based on historical experience  observation of trends in the industry  information provided by customers and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
management believes that full consideration has been given to all relevant circumstances that we may be subject to  and the consolidated financial statements of the company accurately reflect management s best estimate of the consolidated results of operations  financial position and cash flows of the company for the years presented 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different conditions or assumptions 
revenue recognition 
we recognize sales based on the terms of the customer purchase order  which indicates title to the product and risk of ownership passes to the customer upon shipment 
sales are shown net of returns and allowances 
reserves for estimated returns and allowances are provided when sales are recorded based on historical experience and current trends 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts 
we record an allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect our estimate of the collectibility of our trade accounts receivable 
we evaluate the collectibility of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors  including an analysis of the age of customer accounts and our historical experience with accounts receivable write offs 
the analysis also includes the financial condition of a specific customer or industry  and general economic conditions 
in circumstances where we are aware of customer charge backs or a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  a specific reserve for bad debts applicable to amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount management reasonably believes will be collected is recorded 
in those situations with ongoing discussions  the amount of bad debt recognized is based on the status of the discussions 
while bad debt allowances have been within expectations and the provisions established  there can be no guarantee that we will continue to experience the same allowance rate we have in the past 
inventories 
we value our inventories at the lower of cost or market  cost being determined on the first in  first out method 
reserves for excess and obsolete or unmarketable merchandise are provided based on historical experience  assumptions about future product demand and market conditions 
the adequacy of these reserves are evaluated quarterly 
if market conditions are less favorable than projected or if technological developments result in accelerated obsolescence  additional write downs may be required 
while markdowns and obsolescence have been within expectations and the provisions established  there can be no guarantee that we will continue to experience the same level of markdowns we have in the past 
long lived assets 
management exercises judgment in evaluating our long lived assets for impairment 
we believe we will generate sufficient undiscounted cash flow to more than recover the investments made in property  plant and equipment 
while we believe that our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable  different assumptions regarding such cash flows could materially affect our evaluations income taxes 
we are subject to taxation from federal  state and foreign jurisdictions and the determination of our tax provision is complex and requires significant management judgment 
management judgment is also applied in the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances that might be required in connection with our ability to realize deferred tax assets 
since we conduct operations internationally  our effective tax rate has and will continue to depend upon the geographic distribution of our pre tax income or losses among locations with varying tax rates and rules 
as the geographic mix of our pre tax results among various tax jurisdictions changes  the effective tax rate may vary from period to period 
we are also subject to periodic examination from domestic and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due 
these examinations include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
we have established  and periodically reevaluate  an estimated income tax reserve on our consolidated balance sheet to provide for the possibility of adverse outcomes in income tax proceedings 
while management believes that we have identified all reasonably identifiable exposures and that the reserve we have established for identifiable exposures is appropriate under the circumstances  it is possible that additional exposures exist and that exposures may be settled at amounts different than the amounts reserved 
we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  accounting for income taxes  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
the realization of net deferred tax assets is dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income 
where it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized  we have provided a valuation allowance 
if the realization of those deferred tax assets in the future is considered more likely than not  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase net income in the period such determination is made 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  an adjustment to the valuation allowance may be required  which could materially affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
restructuring charges 
we have taken restructuring actions  and may commence further restructuring activities which requires management to utilize significant estimates related to expenses for severance and other employee separation costs  lease cancellations  asset impairments and other exit costs 
should the actual amounts differ from our estimates  the amount of the restructuring charges could be impacted  which could materially affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
recent accounting developments in november  the financial accounting standards board issued interpretation  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  which requires that a guarantor recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
however  the provisions related to recognizing a liability at inception of the guarantee for the fair value of the guarantor s obligations does not apply to product warranties or to guarantees accounted for as derivatives 
interpretation also elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees it has issued 
the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of this interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  and the disclosure requirements in this interpretation are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  the adoption of the recognition and measurement provisions of interpretation did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued interpretation revised to address certain interpretation implementation issues 
this interpretation clarifies the application of accounting research bulletin  consolidated financial statements  for companies that have interests in entities that are variable interest entities as defined under interpretation according to this interpretation  if a company has an interest in a variable interest entity and is at risk for a majority of the variable interest entity s expected losses or receives a majority of the variable interest entity s expected gains it shall consolidate the variable interest entity 
interpretation r also requires additional disclosures by primary beneficiaries and other significant variable interest holders 
for entities acquired or created before february   this interpretation is effective no later than the end of the first interim or reporting period ending after march   except for those variable interest entity s that are considered to be special purpose entities  for which the effective date is no later than the end of the first interim or annual reporting period ending after december  for all entities that were acquired subsequent to january   this interpretation is effective as of the first interim or annual period ending after december  we have adopted interpretation r and are evaluating the impact of this interpretation on our consolidated financial statements 
in april  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards  amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
statement of financial accounting standards amends and clarifies statement of financial accounting standards for the financial accounting and reporting of derivative instruments and hedging activities and requires that contracts with similar characteristics be accounted for on a comparable basis 
the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards are effective for contracts entered into or modified after june   and for hedging relationships designated after june  the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in may  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas  accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
statement of financial accounting standards establishes standards on the classification and measurement of certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards are effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may  and to all other instruments that exist as of the beginning of the first interim financial reporting period beginning after june  the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to market risks  which include changes in us and international interest rates as well as changes in currency exchange rates as measured against the us dollar and each other 
we have limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and do not use them for trading purposes 
changes in currency exchange rates as measured against the us dollar may positively or negatively affect sales  gross margins  operating expenses and retained earnings as expressed in us dollars 
we may enter into foreign currency options or forward exchange contracts aimed at limiting in part the impact of certain currency fluctuations  but as of december  we had no outstanding forward exchange contracts 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our variable rate debt 
in connection with our united kingdom term loan agreement  effective april  we entered into an interest rate collar agreement to reduce our exposure to market rate fluctuations 
at december  the notional amount of the interest rate collar was million million at the december  exchange rate with an interest rate cap of and a floor of 
the interest rate collar expires on april
