at december   cna surety s largest reinsurance receivable from an affiliate  ccc  an a rated company by am best  was approximately million 
in addition  due to the nature of the reinsurance products available to the company and other sureties  reinsurers may cover principals for whom the company writes surety bonds in one year  but then exclude or provide only limited reinsurance for these same principals in subsequent years 
as a result the company may continue to have exposure to these principals with limited or no reinsurance for bonds written during years that the company had reinsurance covering these principals 
reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses cna surety s insurance subsidiaries employ generally accepted reserving approaches in establishing the estimated liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses that give consideration to the inherent difficulty and variability in the estimation process 
in addition  cna surety utilizes an independent actuarial firm of national standing to conduct periodic reviews of loss reserving practices  and annually obtains actuarial certification as to the reasonableness of actuarial assumptions used and the sufficiency of year end reserves for each of its principal insurance subsidiaries 
the estimated liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses includes  on an undiscounted basis  estimates of a the ultimate settlement value of reported claims  b incurred but not reported ibnr claims  c future expenses to be incurred in the settlement of claims and d claim recoveries  exclusive of reinsurance recoveries which are reported as an asset 
these estimates are determined based on the company s and surety industry loss experience as well as consideration of current trends and conditions 
the estimated liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses is an estimate and there is the potential that actual future loss payments will differ significantly from initial estimates 
the methods of determining such estimates and the resulting estimated liability are regularly reviewed and updated 
changes in the estimated liability are reflected in operating income in the period in which such changes are determined to be needed 
a table is included in note to the consolidated financial statements  reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses that presents the activity in the reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses for the company and is incorporated herein by reference 
this table highlights the impact of revisions to the estimated liability established in prior years

the first section shows the reserves as originally reported at the end of the stated year 
the second section shows the cumulative amounts paid as of the end of successive years with respect to that reserve liability 
the third section shows re estimates of the original recorded reserve as of the end of each successive year which is the result of management s expanded awareness of additional facts and circumstances that pertain to the unsettled claims 
the last section compares the latest re estimated reserve to the reserve originally established  and indicates whether or not the original reserve was adequate or inadequate to cover the estimated costs of unsettled claims 
the loss reserve development table is cumulative as of each december  and  therefore  ending balances should not be added since the amount at the end of each calendar year includes activity for both the current and prior years

the disposition of claims and other claim related activity is done in accordance with established policies  procedures and expense controls designed to minimize loss costs and maximize salvage and subrogation recoveries 
indemnity and subrogation rights exist on a significant portion of the business written  enabling the company to pursue loss recovery from the principal 
environmental claims the company does not typically bond contractors that specialize in hazardous environmental remediation work 
the company does however bond several accounts that have incidental environmental exposure with respect to which the company provides bonding programs 
in the commercial surety market  the company provides bonds to large corporations that are in the business of mining various minerals and are obligated to post reclamation bonds that guarantee that property which was disturbed during mining is returned to an acceptable condition when the mining is completed 
the company also provides court and other surety bonds for large corporations wherein the underlying action involves environmental related issues 
while no environmental responsibility is overtly provided by commercial or contract bonds  some risk of environmental exposure may exist if the surety were to assume certain rights in the completion of a defaulted project or through salvage recovery 
the company estimates its net case incurred losses on known claims of this nature to be million as of december  regulation the company s insurance subsidiaries are subject to varying degrees of regulation and supervision in the jurisdictions in which they transact business under statutes that delegate regulatory  supervisory and administrative powers to state insurance regulators 
in general  an insurer s state of domicile has principal responsibility for such regulation which is designed generally to protect policyholders rather than investors and relates to matters such as the standards of solvency which must be maintained  the licensing of insurers and their agents  the examination of the affairs of insurance companies  including periodic financial and market conduct examinations  the filing of annual and other reports  prepared on a statutory basis  on the financial condition of insurers or for other purposes  establishment and maintenance of reserves for unearned premiums and losses  and requirements regarding numerous other matters 
licensed or admitted insurers generally must file with the insurance regulators of such states  or have filed on its behalf  the premium rates and bond and policy forms used within each state 
in some states  approval of such rates and forms must be received from the insurance regulators in advance of their use 
western surety is domiciled in south dakota and licensed in all states and the district of columbia and puerto rico 
sbca is domiciled in south dakota and licensed in states and the district of columbia 
usa is domiciled in texas and licensed in states and the district of columbia 
insurance regulations generally also require registration and periodic disclosure of certain information concerning ownership  financial condition  capital structure  general business operations and any material transactions or agreements by or among affiliates 
such regulation also typically restricts the ability of any one person to acquire or more  either directly or indirectly  of a company s stock without prior approval of the applicable insurance regulatory authority 
in addition  dividends and other distributions to stockholders generally may be paid only out of unreserved and unrestricted statutory earned surplus 
such distributions may be subject to prior regulatory approval  including a review of the implications on risk based capital requirements

these examinations are generally performed by the domiciliary state insurance regulatory authorities 
the south dakota department of commerce and regulation division of insurance the south dakota department conducted its financial and market conduct examination of western surety for the five year period ended december  the south dakota department made a finding of non compliance with respect to the company s practices regarding return of premiums and recommended that western surety change its current procedures regarding the return of premiums 
the regulation in question was subsequently amended to exclude surety products that eliminated any non compliance by the company 
the texas department of insurance the texas department conducted an examination of usa s financial matters as of december  there were no significant issues noted which required corrective action by usa 
both the south dakota department of commerce and regulation insurance division and the texas department of insurance have completed their respective reviews of the five year period ended december  the points noted in their reviews were largely administrative in nature and have been addressed by management 
they do not have a material impact policyholders surplus  nor have they resulted in any fines or penalties to cna surety or any of its subsidiaries 
certain states in which cna surety s insurance subsidiaries conduct their business require insurers to join a guaranty association 
guaranty associations provide protection to policyholders of insurers licensed in such states against the insolvency of those insurers 
in order to provide the associations with funds to pay certain claims under policies issued by insolvent insurers  the guaranty associations charge members assessments based on the amount of direct premiums written in that state 
such assessments were not material to cna surety s results of operations in western surety and sbca each qualifies as an acceptable surety for federal and other public works project bonds pursuant to us department of treasury regulations

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is a discussion and analysis of cna surety corporation cna surety or the company and its subsidiaries operating results  liquidity and capital resources  and financial condition 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of cna surety and notes thereto 
introduction management believes that the following areas represent the most significant risks and uncertainties impacting the operating performance and financial condition of the company 
the financial impacts of these issues would affect gross and net written premium  incurred losses and reserves for unpaid losses 
each of these issues is discussed in greater detail later in this section 
availability and cost of reinsurance reinsurance coverage is an important component of the company s capital structure 
reinsurance allows the company to meet certain regulatory restrictions that would otherwise limit the size of bonds that the company writes and limit the market segments in which the company could compete 
in addition  reinsurance reduces the potential volatility of earnings and protects the company s capital by limiting the amount of loss associated with any one bond principal 
due to increased loss frequency and severity for both the company and within the surety industry in general that began emerging in  the company  beginning in  paid substantially higher reinsurance premiums and was required to retain higher amounts of its per principal exposure 
through aggressive exposure reduction efforts and continued underwriting discipline  the company has been able to purchase additional limits and more expansive reinsurance protection for and as compared to exposure to loss on principals excluded from reinsurance programs beginning in  the company s reinsurers excluded certain accounts for which the company had continuing exposure from bonds written in prior years from the reinsurance programs 
for these accounts  the company would retain up to million of loss 
due to the improved financial condition of some of these accounts and the company s efforts to have these accounts covered  two of these accounts are again covered under the company s reinsurance program 
however  the company s reinsurance program for does exclude three principals 
of these excluded principals  one is a foreign industrial enterprise  one is a domestic electric utility and the other is a large national contractor 
as of december   management estimates that the company s net exposure to these accounts would be million  million and million  respectively 
the foreign industrial enterprise and the electric utility are discussed on page  and the large national contractor is discussed in detail on page as of december   no material loss event has occurred with respect to these three principals 
financial strength ratings surety bond principals and obligees often refer to the financial strength ratings assigned by am best co 
am best  standard and poor s s p and other similar companies when they are choosing a surety company 
because the company uses the underwriting capacity of continental casualty company ccc and its subsidiaries to serve larger accounts  the insurer financial strength rating of both the company and ccc factor into customers decisions 
after reporting a significant operating loss in the third quarter of  the company s am best rating was lowered from a to a with a negative outlook 
ccc also reported a significant operating loss in the third quarter of  but am best affirmed ccc s rating of a with a negative outlook 
management believes that the current ratings are sufficient for the company to conduct all aspects of its business 
management also believes that a one level reduction in ratings would have only a minimal impact on operations 
a further decrease beyond one level would likely have a material adverse impact on the company s ability to write business 
management believes that the likelihood of further ratings downgrades has been reduced by ongoing efforts to reduce large exposures and the lower per principal retentions under the reinsurance program 
economic conditions the company s results are impacted by general corporate credit conditions  as well as by the condition of the public construction segment of the economy 
while corporate credit default rates appear to be improving from recent historically high levels  the amount of new public construction spending appears to be slowing 
an improvement in overall corporate default rates could be expected to have a favorable impact on the company s loss costs 
a slow down in public construction spending could be expected to put pressure on the company s written premium production and also adversely impact loss costs 
management believes that the diversification of the company s book of business  with approximately of premium from products that are less sensitive to economic conditions  mitigates the impact of these economic factors 
bond premium rates the premium rates that the company charges for its bonds have a direct impact on the amount of revenue generated and on the ratio of incurred losses to earned premium 
over the last several years  the company has charged higher rates for its bonds  particularly in the large commercial and contract segments 
these two segments demonstrated the greater rate need due to the emergence of increased loss frequency and severity as noted above 
while the company will continue to aggressively pursue rate increases where indicated  competitive factors appear to be pointing to a decreased ability to achieve the level of rate increases that have been obtained over the past several years  particularly in the small and middle market contract segments 
critical accounting policies management believes the most significant accounting policies and related disclosures for purposes of understanding the company s results of operations and financial condition pertain to reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses and reinsurance  investments  goodwill and other intangible assets  and deferred policy acquisition costs 
the company s accounting policies related to reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses and related estimates of reinsurance recoverables  are particularly critical to an assessment of the company s financial results 
these areas are highly subjective and require management s most complex judgments because of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses and reinsurance cna surety accrues liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses under its surety and property and casualty insurance contracts based upon estimates of the ultimate amounts payable under the contracts related to losses occurring on or before the balance sheet date 
as of any balance sheet date  all claims have not yet been reported and some claims may not be reported for many years 
as a result  the liability for unpaid losses includes significant estimates for incurred but not reported claims 
additionally  reported claims are in various stages of the settlement process 
each claim is settled individually based upon its merits  and certain claim liabilities may take years to settle  especially if legal action is involved 
the company uses a variety of techniques to establish the liabilities for unpaid claims recorded at the balance sheet date 
while techniques may vary  each employs significant judgments and assumptions 
techniques may involve detailed statistical analysis of past claim reporting  settlement activity  salvage and subrogation activity  claim frequency and severity data when sufficient information exists to lend statistical credibility to the analysis 
the analysis may be based upon internal loss experience or industry experience 
techniques may vary depending on the type of claim being estimated 
liabilities may also reflect implicit or explicit assumptions regarding the potential effects of future economic and social inflation  judicial decisions  law changes  and recent trends in such factors 
receivables recorded with respect to insurance losses ceded to reinsurers under reinsurance contracts are estimated in a manner similar to liabilities for insurance losses and  therefore  are also subject to uncertainty 
in addition to the factors cited above  estimates of reinsurance recoveries may prove uncollectible if the reinsurer is unable to perform under the contract 
reinsurance contracts do not relieve the ceding company of its obligations to indemnify its own policyholders 
cna surety s consolidated balance sheet includes estimated liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses of million and reinsurance receivables related to losses of million at december  compared to estimates of million and million  respectively  at december  while many factors impact these estimates  management believes that past changes in the company s business mix and reinsurance program along with increased corporate default rates were the primary drivers of the need to substantially increase reserve levels in beginning in the late s  the company began writing more bonds for large corporate clients 
shortly thereafter  corporate default rates increased dramatically 
these exposures proved to be more volatile than the company s more traditional contract and small commercial surety products  and began resulting in a higher frequency of severe losses 
as a result  the company s reinsurers significantly increased rates  reduced the amount of coverage available to the company and excluded certain accounts from the reinsurance program 
for  the company s per principal retention increased from million to million 
although the company reduced its per principal retention to million for  these higher retentions  at a time of continuing higher frequency of severe losses  further increased the volatility of results 
since  the company has been aggressively reducing its exposures to large corporate clients 
management believes that these efforts  along with continued underwriting discipline in its traditional contract and small commercial products  have been key to further reducing the company s per principal retention for most accounts to million for the reinsurance program 
management anticipates that these steps will reduce the volatility of the company s results 
due to the inherent uncertainties in the process of establishing the liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses  the actual ultimate claims amounts will differ from the currently recorded amounts 
this difference could have a material effect on reported earnings 
for example  a increase in the december  net estimate for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses would produce a charge to pre tax earnings of approximately million 
future effects from changes in these estimates will be recorded as a component of losses incurred in the period such changes are determined to be needed 
investments management believes the company has the ability to hold all fixed income securities to maturity 
however  the company may dispose of securities prior to their scheduled maturity due to changes in interest rates  prepayments  tax and credit considerations  liquidity or regulatory capital requirements  or other similar factors 
as a result  the company considers all of its fixed income securities bonds and redeemable preferred stocks and equity securities as available for sale 
these securities are reported at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses  net of deferred income taxes  reported as a separate component of stockholders equity 
cash flows from purchases  sales and maturities are reported gross in the investing activities section of the cash flow statement 
the amortized cost of fixed income securities is determined based on cost and the cumulative effect of amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity 
such amortization and accretion are included in investment income 
for mortgage backed and certain asset backed securities  the company recognizes income using the effective yield method based on estimated cash flows 
all securities transactions are recorded on the trade date 
investment gains or losses realized on the sale of securities are determined using the specific identification method 
investments with an other than temporary decline in value are written down to fair value  resulting in losses that are included in realized investment gains and losses 
short term investments that generally include us treasury bills  corporate notes  money market funds and investment grade commercial paper equivalents  are carried at amortized cost which approximates fair value 
invested assets are exposed to various risks  such as interest rate risk  market risk and credit risk 
due to the level of risk associated with invested assets and the level of uncertainty related to changes in the value of these assets  it is possible that changes in risks in the near term may significantly affect the amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of income 
goodwill and other intangible assets cna surety s consolidated balance sheet as of december  includes goodwill and identified intangibles of approximately million 
these amounts represent goodwill and identified intangibles arising from the acquisition of capsure holdings corp 
capsure 
prior to  goodwill from this and other acquisitions were generally amortized as a charge to earnings over periods not exceeding years 
under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
entitled goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
 which was adopted by cna surety as of january   periodic amortization ceased  in accordance with an impairment only accounting model 
a significant amount of judgment is required in performing goodwill impairment tests 
such tests include periodically determining or reviewing the estimated fair value of cna surety s reporting units 
under sfas no 
 fair value refers to the amount for which the entire reporting unit may be bought or sold 
there are several methods of estimating fair value  including market quotations  asset and liability fair values and other valuation techniques  such as discounted cash flows and multiples of earnings or revenues 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit  including goodwill  exceeds the estimated fair value  then individual assets  including identifiable intangible assets  and liabilities of the reporting unit are estimated at fair value 
the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit over the estimated fair value of net assets would establish the implied value of goodwill 
the excess of the recorded amount of goodwill over the implied value of goodwill is recorded as an impairment loss 
deferred policy acquisition costs policy acquisition costs  consisting of commissions  premium taxes and other underwriting expenses which vary with  and are primarily related to  the production of business  net of reinsurance commissions  are deferred and amortized as a charge to income as the related premiums are earned 
anticipated investment income is considered in the determination of the recoverability of deferred acquisition costs

results of operations financial measures the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a discusses certain generally accepted accounting principles gaap and non gaap financial measures in order to provide information used by management to monitor the company s operating performance 
management utilizes various financial measures to monitor the company s insurance operations and investment portfolio 
underwriting results  which are derived from certain income statement amounts  are considered a non gaap financial measure and are used by management to monitor performance of the company s insurance operations 
the company s investment portfolio is monitored through analysis of various quantitative and qualitative factors and certain decisions related to the sale or impairment of investments produce realized gains and losses  which is also a component used in the calculation of net income and is a non gaap financial measure 
underwriting results are computed as net earned premiums less net loss and loss adjustment expenses and net commissions  brokerage and other underwriting expenses 
management uses underwriting results to monitor its insurance operations results without the impact of certain factors  including net investment income  net realized investment gains losses and interest expense 
management excludes these factors in order to analyze the direct relationship between net earned premiums and the related net loss and loss adjustment expenses along with net commissions  brokerage and other underwriting expenses 
operating ratios are calculated using insurance results and are widely used by the insurance industry and regulators such as state departments of insurance and the national association of insurance commissioners for financial regulation and as a basis of comparison among companies 
the ratios discussed in the company s md a are calculated using gaap financial results and include the net loss and loss adjustment expense ratio loss ratio as well as the net commissions  brokerage and other underwriting expense ratio expense ratio and combined ratio 
the loss ratio is the percentage of net incurred claim and claim adjustment expenses to net earned premiums 
the expense ratio is the percentage of net commissions  brokerage and other underwriting expenses  including the amortization of deferred acquisition costs  to net earned premiums 
the combined ratio is the sum of the loss and expense ratios 
the company s investment portfolio is monitored by management through analyses of various factors including unrealized gains and losses on securities  portfolio duration  and exposure to interest rate  market and credit risk 
based on such analyses  the company may impair an investment security in accordance with its policy  or sell a security 
such activities will produce net realized investment gains and losses 
while management uses various gaap and non gaap financial measures to monitor various aspects of the company s performance  net income is the most directly comparable gaap measure and represents a more comprehensive measure of operating performance 
management believes that its process of evaluating performance through the use of these non gaap financial measures provides a basis for enhanced understanding of its operating performance and the impact to net income as a whole 
management also believes that investors may find these widely used financial measures described above useful in interpreting the underlying trends and performance  as well as to provide visibility into the significant components of net income 
comparison of cna surety actual results for the years ended december   and analysis of net income loss the company had a net loss of million for the year ended december  compared to net income of million and million for the comparable periods in and  respectively

the net adverse development on prior accident years of million in primarily relates to accident years and due to changes in estimates of large losses resulting from the material adverse claim activity in the third quarter of this change in estimated net losses reflects the receipt of a payment demand with respect to a portion of an aggregate million insurance program bond

the expense ratio decreased to for the year ended december  as compared to for the decrease in the expense ratio for the year ended december  primarily reflects reduced acquisition and underwriting expenses which were partially offset by the effect of higher reinsurance costs on net earned premiums

in texas  where usa is domiciled  an insurance company may only declare or pay dividends to stockholders from the insurer s earned surplus 
the insurance subsidiaries may pay dividends without obtaining prior regulatory approval only if such dividend or distribution together with dividends or distributions made within the preceding month period is less than  as of the end of the immediately preceding year  the greater of i of the insurer s surplus to policyholders or ii statutory net income 
in south dakota  net income includes net realized capital gains in an amount not to exceed of net unrealized capital gains 
all dividends must be reported to the appropriate insurance department prior to payment 
the dividends that may be paid without prior regulatory approval are determined by formulas established by the applicable insurance regulations  as described above

insurance regulations restrict western surety s maximum net retention on a single surety bond to percent of statutory surplus 
under the excess of loss treaty  the company s net retention on new bonds would generally be million plus a co participation in the million layer of excess reinsurance above the company s retention and this regulation would require minimum statutory surplus of million at western surety

cna surety s portfolio is managed to provide diversification by limiting exposures to any one industry  issue or issuer  and to provide liquidity by investing in the public securities markets 
the portfolio is structured to support cna surety s insurance underwriting operations and to consider the expected duration of liabilities and short term cash needs 
cna surety classifies its fixed maturity securities and its equity securities as available for sale  and as such  they are carried at fair value 
the amortized cost of fixed maturity securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity  which is included in net investment income 
changes in fair value are reported as a component of other comprehensive income 
the estimated fair value and amortized cost of fixed income and equity securities held by cna surety by investment category  were as follows dollars in thousands gross unrealized losses gross amortized cost unrealized less than more than estimated fair december  or cost gains months months value fixed income securities us treasury securities and obligations of us government and agencies us us   us us   collateralized mortgage obligations mortgage pass through securities   obligations of states and political subdivisions    corporate bonds    non agency collateralized mortgage obligations   other asset backed securities second mortgages home equity loans   credit card receivables   other   redeemable preferred stock    total fixed income securities    equity securities  total    invested assets are exposed to various risks  such as interest rate  market and credit 
due to the level of risk associated with certain of these invested assets and the level of uncertainty related to changes in the value of these assets  it is possible that changes in risks in the near term may significantly affect the amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of income

the company follows a consistent and systematic process for impairing securities that sustain other than temporary declines in value 
the company has established a watch list that is reviewed by the chief financial officer and two other executive officers on at least a quarterly basis 
the watch list includes individual securities that fall below certain thresholds or that exhibit evidence of impairment indicators including  but not limited to  a significant adverse change in the financial condition and near term prospects of the investment or a significant adverse change in legal factors  the business climate or credit ratings 
when a security is placed on the watch list  it is monitored for further market value changes and additional news related to the issuer s financial condition 
the focus is on objective evidence that may influence the evaluation of impairment factors 
the decision to record an impairment loss incorporates both quantitative criteria and qualitative information 
the company considers a number of factors including  but not limited to a the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than book value  b the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  c the intent and ability of the company to retain its investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in value  d whether the debtor is current on interest and principal payments and e general market conditions and industry or sector specific factors 
for securities for which an impairment loss has been recorded  the security is written down to fair value and the resulting losses are recognized in realized gains losses in the consolidated statements of operations 
for the years ended december  and  the company had no impaired securities 
reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses cna surety s insurance subsidiaries employ generally accepted reserving approaches in establishing the estimated liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses that give consideration to the inherent difficulty and variability in the estimation process 
the estimated liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses includes  on an undiscounted basis  estimates of a the ultimate settlement value of reported claims  b incurred but not reported ibnr claims  c future expenses to be incurred in the settlement of claims and d claim recoveries  exclusive of reinsurance recoveries which are reported as an asset 
these estimates are determined based on the company s and surety industry loss experience as well as consideration of current trends and conditions 
the estimated liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses is an estimate and there is the potential that actual future loss payments will differ significantly from initial estimates 
the methods of determining such estimates and the resulting estimated liability are regularly reviewed and updated 
changes in the estimated liability are reflected in operating income in the period in which such changes are determined to be needed 
the company s estimated liability for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses is recorded at management s best estimate that is based on various statistical reviews and analyses performed by the company and management s judgment as to the responsiveness of these reviews and analyses to the factors affecting the company s loss and loss adjustment expense reserves 
management considers factors such as changes in inflation  changes in claim handling and case reserving  changes in underwriting and pricing  changes in reinsurance programs  the company s net retained liability and changes in the legal environment 
cna surety utilizes an independent actuarial firm of national standing to conduct periodic reviews of claim procedures and loss reserving practices  and annually obtains actuarial certification as to the reasonableness of actuarial assumptions used and the sufficiency of year end reserves for each of its principal insurance subsidiaries 
in connection with this actuarial certification  the company s independent actuarial firm provides management with additional reports and analysis and its independent judgments regarding loss and loss adjustment expense reserve estimates for management s review 
the company recorded net unfavorable loss reserve development which resulted in increases in the estimated liability of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively

this table highlights the impact of revisions to the estimated liability established in prior years 
risk based capital rbc and other regulatory ratios the national association of insurance commissioners naic has promulgated rbc requirements for property and casualty insurance companies to evaluate the adequacy of statutory capital and surplus in relation to investment and insurance risks such as asset quality  loss reserve adequacy  and other business factors 
the rbc information is used by state insurance regulators as an early warning mechanism to identify insurance companies that potentially are inadequately capitalized 
in addition  the formula defines minimum capital standards that supplement the current system of fixed minimum capital and surplus requirements on a state by state basis 
regulatory compliance is determined by a ratio the ratio of the enterprise s regulatory total adjusted capital  as defined by the naic  to its authorized control level rbc  as defined by the naic 
generally  a ratio in excess of of authorized control level rbc requires no corrective actions on behalf of a company or regulators 
as of december   each of cna surety s insurance subsidiaries had a ratio that was in compliance with minimum rbc requirements 
cna surety s insurance subsidiaries require capital to support premium writings

the combined statutory surplus of western surety and sbca was million and its net written premiums to surplus ratio was to usa s statutory surplus was million and the net written premiums to surplus ratio was to the company believes that each insurance company s statutory surplus is sufficient to support its current and anticipated premium levels 
the naic has also developed a rating system  the insurance regulatory information system iris  primarily intended to assist state insurance departments in overseeing the financial condition of all insurance companies operating within their respective states 
iris consists of twelve financial ratios that address various aspects of each insurer s financial condition and stability 
in and  most of the ratios for western surety  usa and sbca were within the usual ranges as defined by the naic  except as noted 
in  western surety s investment yield was outside the usual range due to greater investment in tax exempt securities 
also  the one year reserve development to policyholder s surplus was outside the usual range due to prior year adverse claim development 
in  western surety s iris ratios were all within the usual ranges as defined by the naic 
in  usa s change in net writings was outside the usual range due to decreased writings of contract surety bonds 
in and  usa s two year overall operating ratio was outside of the usual range  primarily due to increases in the loss and expense ratios 
in  usa s change in policyholders surplus ratio was outside of the usual range primarily due to usa s declaration and payment of an extraordinary dividend to cna surety corporation 
sbca s investment yield for and was outside of the usual range primarily due to generally lower investment rates along with a concentration of short term investments 
in  sbca s change in net writings ratio was outside of the usual range due to increased notary bond volume

item a 
quantitative and qualitative discussions about market risk cna surety s investment portfolio is subject to economic losses due to adverse changes in the fair value of its financial instruments  or market risk 
interest rate risk represents the largest market risk factor affecting the company s consolidated financial condition due to its significant level of investments in fixed income securities 
increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in the fair value of the company s fixed income portfolio 
the fair value of these interest rate sensitive instruments may also be affected by the credit worthiness of the issuer  prepayment options  relative value of alternative investments  the liquidity of the instrument  income tax considerations and general market conditions 
the company manages its exposure to interest rate risk primarily through an asset liability matching strategy 
the company s exposure to interest rate risk is mitigated by the relative short term nature of its insurance and other liabilities 
the targeted effective duration of the company s investment portfolio is approximately years  consistent with the expected duration of its insurance and other liabilities 
the tables below summarize the estimated effects of certain hypothetical increases and decreases in interest rates 
it is assumed that the changes occur immediately and uniformly across each investment category 
the hypothetical changes in market interest rates selected reflect the company s expectations of the reasonably possible best or worst case scenarios over a one year period 
the hypothetical fair values are based upon the same prepayment assumptions that were utilized in computing fair values as of december  significant variations in market interest rates could produce changes in the timing of repayments due to prepayment options available 
the fair value of such instruments could be affected and therefore actual results might differ from those reflected in the following table
